damn soldiers, soldiers.
soldiers are out there
i knew it
now we are dead.
princess, you broke the promise.
i didn't break it.
this is silla
after conquered gaya,
and as if they bestow a favor, they gave us this land
which you can't do anything with it.
and they rip off the tax, this is silla
princess promised to turn back the soldiers
and now she's saying she didn't break the promise.
that is the real truth of silla
princess keep your words
- jang, you - because of the promise that i couldn't keep
i lost a brother who was stronger than blood.
please make it up for this.
chogi, go and tell the soldiers.
that until i order something, they must not move
princess
wrong move worth my life
release him.
i want to know what you found, let's go
oh my gosh,
water is refloating
how did you do this?
it's an earthworm.
earthworm?
they eat soil, multiple times of their body
and give out excrement.
this land is dead because of salt.
but earthworm's fertile can antidote this land.
earthworm makes the soil like this?
not only antidote but to breathe the soil.
it's the same as plowing.
so did you scatter earthworms here?
yes.
where did you get all of them?
when i was young,
i made rouge for somebody using earthworm.
earthworm likes limestone so
i knew tons of earthworms will come out.
are we gonna get us all killed?
will you let your people die like this?
if there's nobody in your country,
it's just the cage that locks up people.
even if you know the wisdom of heaven,
the skill of earth and culture of ocean,
what would you reign
when nobody is there for you to do so.
stop
stop princess is on the way.
stop
listen all of you.
i'll exempt this year's tax.
neverthless,
you have to pay the price for your action.
punish the leader who gathered this movement.
princess's life can't be exchanged with 1,000 servants.
and your personal opinion,
made princess into danger of life.
this, i cannot accept as a guard
this is your second crime.
this cannot be exchanged with life.
stop
you're right to die as a guard.
but i need him with my country, silla.
princess you can't take a part on this.
i will directly talk to the king.
silla has suffered greatly compared to baekjae,
because of infertile land
you'd know much better.
if jang didn't find out the way,
a lot of silla people would have crossed the border.
king will be pleased with this.
if there's a fault, it'd be me.
it's my fault to use him as a guard, when he's special in nature.
therefore i'll put him in right position.
work for my silla
uh-huh what are you doing?
princess is giving you big courtesy,
answer with great honor
work for my silla
work for my silla
i don't want to.
what? you don't want to?
no, i don't. i have a place to go.
don't you know? as long as i need you
your destiny cannot avoid me.
destiny is not to avoid,
destiny is to go its way when you can't avoid it.
although i can avoid my destiny,
i'll go my way.
please forgive me.
stop
- stop - stop
stop
if you don't stop, i'll shot you.
i'll shot
remove your archer
jang, jang is coming
jang? what jang?
it's jang, abandoned jang.
right, i heard that too.
jang is coming, he's coming.
- jang's coming. - oh, jang.
are you sure he's coming back?
yes, it's certain. it is jang for sure.
i came back.
but i didn't come back that misunderstanding is resolved.
that's not it? then what?
last 10 years,
i came back because i know what i've done wrong.
what was your fault?
i forgot why i wanted to stay here.
i realized the study of nature from bumsang.
and seeing him die
with its legacy.
i wanted to be like him.
he's the greatest man i've ever seen.
like mother's will i wanted to that person.
then?
i lost my goal
by accusing myself that i'd killed him.
since i lost my goal,
i lost myself too.
i didn't forgive my mistake
and i wasted my last 10 years.
finally i almost end up losing his will.
what was his last words?
to become the greatest man in my own way.
i'm going to do that.
no matter how you scold me
or whether i'm participated as a member of haneuljae or not,
now i won't be swayed in any situation.
now i'll sway the situation.
i will go towards the nature. that's real me.
that was an impressive speech.
anyway
it's good to have you back.
take care of jang.
please take care of jang.
why, why?
certainly, certainly you still have feeling for me...
back then and now, it's so real and alive. but why?
is this integrity to his father?
is that so?
then you shouldn't be with me when i woke up.
you shouldn't have sent jang to me.
he took away my world.
you sent him and what am i supposed to do?
can't you quit the relation with yeon gamo?
now i won't be swayed in any situation.
now i'll sway the situation.
that's an impressive speech.
sway the situation.
but how can you do it.
princess
princess
nobody can refuse me. i'll kill you with my hands
that's why i followed you.
i don't hold a woman whom i can't say anything to her.
that's who i am.
so please let me go.
it won't happen.
i'm royal,
you're not even a servant but a slave.
if i decide to get rid of you, you're nothing but an ant.
if i tell you to be a warrior, you'll have to be one.
if i tell you to be a craftman, you'll have to be one.
if i tell you to hold me, you'll have to hold me.
i'm not the one who can do this.
otherwise you'll be killed.
you already put down your archer.
the world will kill you.
even if so, that's me.
living unlike me, it was more than hell.
so, princess,
please let me go.
if we're found here, you're in great danger.
you look like you're in danger.
it's too dangerous to let you leave
it took long time for me to determine myself.
now let me walk my way please.
please leave.
princess
aren't they around rabbit hole?
the worthless stuff.
do you collect these things?
no.
this, what's this painting?
i just drew the seed shape of tree.
what's this sign at the bottom?
it's really nothing.
pine trees grow in granite, gneiss and limestone.
why don't write in words?
do you know the words?
no, it's just that i don't know few words.
i'm going to learn.
what is this?
this is about bamboo.
this must be the tree.
this is tree and this, too.
have you been just doing trees for 10 years?
without knowing words, you've done just trees.
what kind of way are you going?
is your path the tree?
no that's not it
but i can start it from tree.
yeah, i can start it from tree.
yes, it is. my path starts from tree
this much?
what's wrong?
what's the matter?
i'm hungry.
does pine mushroom grow one span annually?
yes, it grew up round shape
next year it got one span bigger,
and a year after that it even got bigger and round shape.
does that go on for 100 years?
i don't know that. i've been watching it for 7 years.
if i continue to see,
- it's really mushroom. - right.
look, it's here as well.
sometime jang told us
mushroom is under the pine tree,
staright down to waterfall
nobody listens to him.
you remembered it all.
where it comes food, i listen very carefully.
so i came to check, how blessing kid.
and jang used a pole to stand them.
thank you, uncle.
you don't need to thank me.
just tell her few complements to your mum.
of course, i've thought about you as my father.
you and me, we've things in common.
see, i told you.
princess please leave.
if you get caught, not only it's dangerous
but i get kicked out.
through my childhood, it made me really hard.
i don't want to leave this place.
i want to get acknowledged here.

did really guard wanggoo send letter?
lord's health become severe so he moved to achak.
but it's full of bu yeosun's soldiers.
after private doctor gomo left,
physician medicated king right.
but it got much serious,
now he gets unconcious sometime.
also about the physician
he's suspicious that he might be sir yeosun's people.
do you recognize me?
what happened?
you moved king and he's not improving?
i've done everything i could do.
- please kill me - shut up
how can you say that as a king's physician
i gathered all information.
but there's no improvement.
please kill me.
you must cure him. anyhow
so i thought of you people,
and i found out your residence.
please help me.
i think this is the opportunity that heaven provide.
since prince aja,
is not coming and what if crisis happens
what will happen to baekjae?
i'm sending copy of medical journal of king,
so please send me the prescription immediately.
are you certain king is very severe?
yes.
as he was unconcious?
yes, recently more edema comes.
he's out of breathe and chest is too full so he feels heavy.
he's stupefied sometime in present.
it's his chronic disease when i was his doctor.
but this is extremely severe
so please help me
sir guard said the only people who can take care of king
is dr. mok and expert gomo.
to help him?
this is matter of our medic. this is the job of our nation
of course, i'll take care of haneuljae so,
you two gentlemen need to concentrate on your work.
perhaps did bu yeosun order wrong medication?
looking at the medical journal, nothing's wrong with it.
it's just not the same as my prescription.
also guard wanggoo suspects the physician
so he must have took care of king well.
then even your medication couldn't
cure his basic infectoin?
i think it didn't.
i'm not pursuing you anything so be honest with me.
yes. his edema was too severe and i used
ginseng and all rare herbs.
it did work at that moment but he relaped a year after.
i also medicated king when he was out of breathe.
that also relaped after a while.
plus i could relax him when his urine got contracted.
but his symptoms were the same.
the same symptoms were repeated and after medication
he got better and relaped again.
what's happening?
i'm worried that he doesn't eat anything for few days.
what is the matter? i'll help too.
it's not what you can help us.
medical journal?
so don't get disappointed,
and help mojin to fill our space.
yes, sir.
do symptoms show any infection?
yes, and i gave him medical treatment.
but he relaps after a while?
yes, it may be i treated him wrong medication.
or it's totally different cause.
have you treated all type of medication on infection?
yes, i did everything from the book. however,
however what?
our empreror medical journal is old one.
it gets revised many editions,
so it's possibility that they might have different prescription.
then i'll get other editions.
by yourself?
i can recognize whether it's edition.
this is for the lord.
so look for similar symptoms that you saw from people
and find out the cause. isn't infection common?
yes, i'll get myself ready.
for the king?
the king of baekjae?
i'll go this way.
there were symptoms near the river villege.
alright, we don't have time. hurry to come back.
yes.
it's the age age
princess princess
why are you so noisy?
it's the age age
age? what about?
this here, the grain of wood.
it's 7 it means he's 10 years old.
how do you know that?
i planted this tree 10 years ago.
then grain shows the age of tree?
follow me please.
did you cut down all these trees?
look at this, there are 7 grains.
this one, too.
i planted all these trees 10 years ago.
so this tree takes about 3 years to stump
and rest of grain is sure for age.
are they all the same kind?
no, they are all different.
look at this one, this has 10 grains.
when i saw it, it was a little tree.
this one has more than 30 grains.
it was well grown tree.
i didn't know that.
i was watching it everyday and i never thought ot it.
i always measured height and width.
but it's age. age.
tree gets old and old
well, it looks like it's age according to you.
it's not look like it. it is so, age
but it's very unusual.
what's unusaul?
the grain is not only the same as numbers.
also the shape of it.
look here, first one is narrow and second is wider.
then third one is wider and fourth one is narrower.
look here.
the outside of grain gap for 10 years resembles.
oh? that's true.
it's similar after 10 years.
right.
based on the 10 year old tree,
the gap, outside to inside, is pretty much similar.
narrow spot is narrow and wide spot is all wide.
wow, it's very wonderful.
there is a reason. there must be a reason
copy the medical journal of baekjae king
is this astronomical book?
yes.
but
did servants keep it this detail?
we wasn't born as a servant.
is that so?
yes, we used to supply things to palace.
but when soo took over, i downfell as a servant.
that's right.
that's why they tried to find you people in soo.
yes.
why? what's so strage?
this, whose medical journal is this?
maybe it got stuck accidently.
astronomical book might have the answer.
what grows a tree is sun and rain.
but there,
what is it?
there are so many words that i don't know in astronomy.
you won't ask me to leave for a while.
why are you so quiet?
shall we go?
please teach me a lot.
ok, i'll think about it.
what happened here?
medical journal is missing episode 9.
yeah? medical journal too?
eunjin saw many shooting star last night and
she tried to record it but astronomical jounral was missing.
medical and astronomical journals, why?
i'll gather people to ask.
what's going on?
did anyone take astronomical journal?
not me.
why suddenly?
i'm not here to blame. just talk to me.
anyone can see it, why would someone do that?
perhaps you didn't take one?
i don't need to have one.
who is not here?
giroo, i don't see giroo.
and neither does jang.
it's here.
how about medical journal?
i don't see that. and not all of astronomical journals are here.
