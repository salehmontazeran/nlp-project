princess you broke the promise
i didn't break it
this is silla
after conquered gaya
and as if they bestow a favor they gave us this land
which you can't do anything with it
and they rip off the tax this is silla
princess promised to turn back the soldiers
and now she's saying she didn't break the promise
that is the real truth of silla
princess keep your words

i lost a brother who was stronger than blood

release him
i want to know what you found let's go
oh my gosh
water is refloating
how did you do this
it's an earthworm
earthworm
they eat soil multiple times of their body
and give out excrement
this land is dead because of salt
but earthworm's fertile can antidote this land
earthworm makes the soil like this
not only antidote but to breathe the soil
it's the same as plowing
so did you scatter earthworms here
yes
where did you get all of them
when i was young
i made rouge for somebody using earthworm
earthworm likes limestone so
i knew tons of earthworms will come out
are we gonna get us all killed
will you let your people die like this
if there's nobody in your country
it's just the cage that locks up people
even if you know the wisdom of heaven
the skill of earth and culture of ocean
what would you reign
when nobody is there for you to do so
stop
stop princess is on the way
stop
listen all of you
i'll exempt this year's tax
neverthless
you have to pay the price for your action
punish the leader who gathered this movement
princess's life can't be exchanged with 1000 servants
and your personal opinion
made princess into danger of life
this i cannot accept as a guard
this is your second crime
this cannot be exchanged with life
stop
you're right to die as a guard
but i need him with my country silla
princess you can't take a part on this
i will directly talk to the king
silla has suffered greatly compared to baekjae
because of infertile land
you'd know much better
if jang didn't find out the way
a lot of silla people would have crossed the border
king will be pleased with this
if there's a fault it'd be me
it's my fault to use him as a guard when he's special in nature
therefore i'll put him in right position
work for my silla
uhhuh what are you doing
princess is giving you big courtesy
answer with great honor
work for my silla
work for my silla
i don't want to
what you don't want to
no i don't i have a place to go
don't you know as long as i need you
your destiny cannot avoid me
destiny is not to avoid
destiny is to go its way when you can't avoid it
although i can avoid my destiny
i'll go my way
please forgive me
stop
stop  stop
stop
if you don't stop i'll shot you
i'll shot
remove your archer
jang jang is coming
jang what jang
it's jang abandoned jang
right i heard that too
jang is coming he's coming
jang's coming  oh jang
are you sure he's coming back
yes it's certain it is jang for sure
i came back
but i didn't come back that misunderstanding is resolved
that's not it then what
last 10 years
i came back because i know what i've done wrong
what was your fault
i forgot why i wanted to stay here
i realized the study of nature from bumsang
and seeing him die
with its legacy
i wanted to be like him
he's the greatest man i've ever seen
like mother's will i wanted to that person
then
i lost my goal
by accusing myself that i'd killed him
since i lost my goal
i lost myself too
i didn't forgive my mistake
and i wasted my last 10 years
finally i almost end up losing his will
what was his last words
to become the greatest man in my own way
i'm going to do that
no matter how you scold me
or whether i'm participated as a member of haneuljae or not
now i won't be swayed in any situation
now i'll sway the situation
i will go towards the nature that's real me
that was an impressive speech
anyway
it's good to have you back
take care of jang
please take care of jang
why why
certainly certainly you still have feeling for me
back then and now it's so real and alive but why
is this integrity to his father
is that so
then you shouldn't be with me when i woke up
you shouldn't have sent jang to me
he took away my world
you sent him and what am i supposed to do
can't you quit the relation with yeon gamo
now i won't be swayed in any situation
now i'll sway the situation
that's an impressive speech
sway the situation
but how can you do it
princess
princess
nobody can refuse me i'll kill you with my hands
that's why i followed you
i don't hold a woman whom i can't say anything to her
that's who i am
so please let me go
it won't happen
i'm royal
you're not even a servant but a slave
if i decide to get rid of you you're nothing but an ant
if i tell you to be a warrior you'll have to be one
if i tell you to be a craftman you'll have to be one
if i tell you to hold me you'll have to hold me
i'm not the one who can do this
otherwise you'll be killed
you already put down your archer
the world will kill you
even if so that's me
living unlike me it was more than hell
so princess
please let me go
if we're found here you're in great danger
you look like you're in danger
it's too dangerous to let you leave
it took long time for me to determine myself
now let me walk my way please
please leave
princess
aren't they around rabbit hole
the worthless stuff
do you collect these things
no
this what's this painting
i just drew the seed shape of tree
what's this sign at the bottom
it's really nothing
pine trees grow in granite gneiss and limestone
why don't write in words

i'm going to learn
what is this
this is about bamboo
this must be the tree

what's the matter
i'm hungry
does pine mushroom grow one span annually
yes it grew up round shape
next year it got one span bigger
and a year after that it even got bigger and round shape
does that go on for 100 years
i don't know that i've been watching it for 7 years
if i continue to see
it's really mushroom  right

did really guard wanggoo send letter
lord's health become severe so he moved to achak
but it's full of bu yeosun's soldiers
after private doctor gomo left
physician medicated king right
but it got much serious
now he gets unconcious sometime
also about the physician
he's suspicious that he might be sir yeosun's people
do you recognize me
what happened
you moved king and he's not improving
i've done everything i could do
please kill me  shut up
how can you say that as a king's physician
i gathered all information
but there's no improvement
please kill me
you must cure him anyhow
so i thought of you people
and i found out your residence
please help me
i think this is the opportunity that heaven provide
since prince aja
is not coming and what if crisis happens
what will happen to baekjae
i'm sending copy of medical journal of king
so please send me the prescription immediately
are you certain king is very severe
yes
as he was unconcious
yes recently more edema comes
he's out of breathe and chest is too full so he feels heavy
he's stupefied sometime in present
it's his chronic disease when i was his doctor
but this is extremely severe
so please help me
sir guard said the only people who can take care of king
is dr mok and expert gomo
to help him
this is matter of our medic this is the job of our nation
of course i'll take care of haneuljae so
you two gentlemen need to concentrate on your work
perhaps did bu yeosun order wrong medication
looking at the medical journal nothing's wrong with it
it's just not the same as my prescription
also guard wanggoo suspects the physician
so he must have took care of king well
then even your medication couldn't
cure his basic infectoin
i think it didn't
i'm not pursuing you anything so be honest with me
yes his edema was too severe and i used
ginseng and all rare herbs
it did work at that moment but he relaped a year after
i also medicated king when he was out of breathe
that also relaped after a while
plus i could relax him when his urine got contracted
but his symptoms were the same
the same symptoms were repeated and after medication
he got better and relaped again
what's happening
i'm worried that he doesn't eat anything for few days
what is the matter i'll help too
it's not what you can help us
medical journal
so don't get disappointed
and help mojin to fill our space
yes sir
do symptoms show any infection
yes and i gave him medical treatment
but he relaps after a while
yes it may be i treated him wrong medication
or it's totally different cause
have you treated all type of medication on infection
yes i did everything from the book however
however what
our empreror medical journal is old one
it gets revised many editions
so it's possibility that they might have different prescription
then i'll get other editions
by yourself
i can recognize whether it's edition
this is for the lord
so look for similar symptoms that you saw from people
and find out the cause isn't infection common
yes i'll get myself ready
for the king
the king of baekjae
i'll go this way
there were symptoms near the river villege
alright we don't have time hurry to come back
yes
it's the age age
princess princess
why are you so noisy
it's the age age
age what about
this here the grain of wood
it's 7 it means he's 10 years old
how do you know that
i planted this tree 10 years ago
then grain shows the age of tree
follow me please
did you cut down all these trees
look at this there are 7 grains
this one too
i planted all these trees 10 years ago
so this tree takes about 3 years to stump
and rest of grain is sure for age
are they all the same kind
no they are all different
look at this one this has 10 grains
when i saw it it was a little tree
this one has more than 30 grains
it was well grown tree
i didn't know that
i was watching it everyday and i never thought ot it
i always measured height and width
but it's age age
tree gets old and old
well it looks like it's age according to you
it's not look like it it is so age
but it's very unusual
what's unusaul
the grain is not only the same as numbers
also the shape of it
look here first one is narrow and second is wider
then third one is wider and fourth one is narrower
look here
the outside of grain gap for 10 years resembles
oh that's true
it's similar after 10 years
right
based on the 10 year old tree
the gap outside to inside is pretty much similar
narrow spot is narrow and wide spot is all wide
wow it's very wonderful
there is a reason there must be a reason
copy the medical journal of baekjae king
is this astronomical book
yes
but
did servants keep it this detail
we wasn't born as a servant
is that so
yes we used to supply things to palace
but when soo took over i downfell as a servant
that's right
that's why they tried to find you people in soo
yes
why what's so strage
this whose medical journal is this
maybe it got stuck accidently
astronomical book might have the answer
what grows a tree is sun and rain
but there
what is it
there are so many words that i don't know in astronomy
you won't ask me to leave for a while
why are you so quiet
shall we go
please teach me a lot
ok i'll think about it
what happened here
medical journal is missing episode 9
yeah medical journal too
eunjin saw many shooting star last night and
she tried to record it but astronomical jounral was missing
medical and astronomical journals why
i'll gather people to ask
what's going on
did anyone take astronomical journal
not me
why suddenly
i'm not here to blame just talk to me
anyone can see it why would someone do that
perhaps you didn't take one
i don't need to have one
who is not here
giroo i don't see giroo
and neither does jang
it's here
how about medical journal
i don't see that and not all of astronomical journals are here
find it find it now
jang
jang
jang  jang
jang
have you found him
no  no
it's humidity humidity
it's jang's voice
jang
who is it who were you talking to
i was shouting myself
shouting yourself
yes a fool like me found the cause of a patient
so i shouted myself
you found the cause of patient  yes
what is it  it's humidity
humidity explain it in detail
frankly i found out that
the grain of tree was sign of its age
we know that
then did you know
the shape of grain was relevant to the weather
when the year of grain is wide
it means it's exceptionally hot and humid and a lot of rain
when it's narrow it means dry and cold less rain
is that rue
yes i compared to astronomical journal
and i saw medical journal
when sickness gets severe exceptionally
i compared to the grain
when he got severe it matches the wide year
it gets worse when it's humid and damp
right he's right
and i digged up my memory
in humid year mold is gathered in the house
swollen patients increased and people trouble breathing
also many people died
it was hot and humid this year
i don't know this patient but he'll be very sick now
humidity humidity
follow me all of you you too jang
right it's humidity
it is right
it exactly matches the symptoms of damp disease
i knew cold heat wind damp are bad energy
detail symptoms were not written in meantime
it has big part in this edition
it is so right
jang you've done a great work
the patient of this medical journal is the king
what
in fact he is severe
but you found the cause
his sickness is damp disease its cause is humidity energy
damp not damned
i thought kidney was the problem and treated in that way
his sickness got deeper and deeper
but it was damp disease
damp energy goes into joints and organs
when it reaches meridian paitent gets fever swollen
when it reaches joints all joints are swollen and painful
to nose and throat it causes asthma to trouble breathing
when it reaches organs patient may die
when it rains my shoulder knee and arms it's all sore
is this damp disease too  it is
when i sleep in wet place
my back is so heavy that i can't stretch my waist
is this damp disease too  it is
it's not cold in middle of summer
and i get to cough a lot is this that damp
that isn't the problem
we know the cause don't we just prescribe it
there isn't any principle medication
there is a medication which will slow down
but if we can't make the environment to block humidity
it doesn't
the environment that dissolves humidity
so now i say to all of you
investigate how we make the environment without humidity
it's directly related to king's health so use all your energy
yes sir
there's only one way
what is it  get rid of summer
it's easy to get rid of summer
make spring longer and make autumn come quick
make the big fan and blow out the rainstorm
then how about our farming
studying the nature is really hard
i can't wipe out humidity in the air
anyway isn't jang so smart
he was good at with words but
now he solves his stuff
right he looks different
should i deliver what you just said to him
how about we lay mats here
wouldn't it block humidity from ground
straw gets wetter when water is absorbed
look at this
anyone looking for this
why did you copy it secretly
i wanted to help
excellent you pull it off
thank you
and the woman
was she eunjin
perhaps she wasn't outsider
now you're settling down
don't be stupid to blow your merits
bye bye
humidity humidity
i'll visit to seorabul
why serabul
there might be an answer in seorabul
what is it
it's too early to tell i'll tell you when i come back
leave now
it's very important for king's health
i want you to play a big part on this one
yes
how can he vanish without a word
why carriage
i asked for it to the palace
i couldn't help it this time
has the thing that you wanted to change changed
yes
yes it changed
i'm changed
lord it's princess sunhwa
my lord have you been well
because of you
you took my agony
you figured out the problem of farming land
well done
although you didn't report its incident
your spirit was good enough to be praised
and people were unsettled
but you solved it peacefully
many people are motivated
that is the hierarchy
when your position is high your spirit and
your knowledge have to be high
i have kearnt many things from it
really what is it
the wisdom of earthworm can provide
more food for people than the land acquired by war
so please allow me to study the outside of the world
again
no i want you next to me now
the man who helped me will achieve a great merit for silla
allow me to take care of the nature with him
he can come to the palace
no i can learn more things around the nature
than in this palace
if that's what you want do it
but i always want to see you so come by often
yes
alright
did you hear it
you shouldn't vanish without saying to me
right you should have me next to you
ok i got it
i'm going to jingak temple get ready
yes
isn't jingak near
where you hurt your legs
where the kid is at right
is this the medical journal of baekjae king
yes notjust sickness also daily routine as well
what's his sickness  it's called damp disease
is it severe disease
he got so severe that he has to move to royal villa
he's severe
i heard you were looking for a chance to hit baekjae
it is very crucial information
doham did a greatjob
yes well done
i remember he asked me to give princess sunhwa
i treated it as a joke
but they're already grown up
plus both of them achieved big merits
they're very trustful very trustful
didn't i say it's good that you came along
yes
even if you've done a good thing
it gets buried
but princess seems to have satisfied
something happened
princess solved the farming land problem by earthworm
and she got a lot of credit from king
using earthworm to solve farming
yes it's not too far reaching our dream
all you need to do is be a doctor and come back home soon
priest
the lord praised me too
and told me to assist you
yes it's been fine
yes
you guys here you guys there you guys at the back
search it competely  yes
what's going on
i see strange happening
there's a theif stealing only stones
stealing stone only
look over there
there are stones missing at the iljumoon stairs
someone was playing around
this is more than a joke
the monument is missing in other villege
they even took the stone bridge
we have to catch this thief
is there any evidence
someone saw a man carrying a stone to haneuljae
haneuljae
yes soldiers are searching in any minute
we'll know the reason why he did this
search haneuljae  yes
what's going on
why do soldiers gather at the bottom
yeah i didn't know so
don't you know we're in trouble if haneuljae is found out
but if they're already coming up
isn't it too late
you must stop them you must
wouldn't it be too late if i go to
you must go now
i'll stop soldiers somehow
you go first now
i'll be out first
let's do that  let's go
soji and juriyoung stand on the road
go to the nominated destination with giroo
yes hurry  be careful
bumro find jang  yes
the rest moves now
yes  let's move
jang
what is this
this is humidity
i can make a house without humidity
this is the ondol
ondol
when i pave warm stones instead of sand
not only cold and it blocks the humidity as well
so i'm looking which stone is appropriate
it gets heat up quickly but it gets cool down quick too
and this heats up slowly and cools down slowly
and this stone is very hard and grain
it's appropriate for hypocaust
but it has disadvantage of getting it
and this stone  that one it's monument
soldiers were dispatched because of that kid
how can i do this
nuts he doesn't know what he's done
and not only it exterminate humidity
it blocks the cold in winter
that's the quality of being learner of study
but it got more dangerous
he became more dangerous finding myself
that stone is too weak and this stone
drag jang now you don't have time to do this
now
doctor  why did you leave giroo
soldiers are gone
what gone
yes they arrested the criminal
he was caught
i'll go down to office to check things out
wait until i come back  ok
let's go
why did you take out important stones of villege
it's not important stones
i did it becaues the stones bring bad spirit to villege
bring bad spirit
didn't exceptional contagious disease happen few years ago
didn't flood and drought repeat few years ago
what are you trying to say
i study changes and topography
but the location where you put your monument was
the spot of villege where it converges
how can this villege be prosperous
when the center of its head is pressed down
you must lift it up
then why stone and bridge from iljumoon
does that relate to topography again
yes
those stones were blocking other spirit of this villege
you liar
the protected monument of villege and jingak temple
was built according to priest's consultation
with your silly knowledge
why are you disturbing the villege won't you tell the truth
smack him until he confesses the truth
yes sir
stop
release him
what happened how did you get released
this is in front of office i'll tell you on the way
alright
if not giroo's wit and sacrifice
you were in big trouble again
sorry i was so focused on one thing
i don't know what to do
don't be harsh things turn out fine
and jang did it with will
and instead of this
isn't king's health much more important
i went to seorabul and i got the method
where is doctor mok rasso now
doctor what are these stones for
it's ondol which removes humidity
ondol
i heard that goguryu uses warm stones for bed
to protect the cold
yes right
but northern people of cold area thought
to use it only for cold
then can it obstruct the humidity
think about it
when warm stones obstruct moist from ground
moist will be exterminated
but we must make a fire in the house
i can't stand smoke
no smoke will go out through this pipe
look at this after piling stones on here and cover with sand
this will become floor of the room
that's why stones were placed here
yes if i make a fire here
flame and smoke will go through in between
and these stones are heated naturally
after this smoke will go out of house through this pipe
ondol blocks the cold and exterminate humidity
more importantly this fireplace
can be fired all the time
so it's unlimited energy source
doctor this is
the reform of dwelling
you can always cook and use hot water
and it'll prevent so many diseases apart from cold and moist
as you know property of stone is
very good for human body
more importantly not only aristrocrats
but commoners can get these stones
doctor you are incredible
i was thinking about charcoal for extermination of moist
and i was proud of myself
but you are always up there higher than me
no not me
not you
it's jang jang
jang did
bring jang  yes
my heart got pound because of his study
but you all saw it
what jang has done today
that's the quality of studying the nature
he didn't stop finding the grain
he found out the shape of grain is related to the weather
and he went further to find relation with sickness
and he didn't stop there
he studied the principle defense of exterminating humidity
and he invented the ondol
look at his arms and legs
taking those stones out
he couldn't think that we could have been in danger
but he didn't even know his body was hurt
i can't punish jang rather i thank him
you've done what none of us could do healing king's health
but still i can't acknowledge all your merits
don't be so harsh
you told us to go crazy like bumsang
right when bumsang
found out feces can be great fertilizer for a field
then he put feces on aristocrat's fields
right right
that's how he became an engineer
and harvest was very good
right mother you always told me
to go crazy like dr mok
yes engineer this is different from regulation
right
i have to learn and get acknowledgement from him
to be admirable
so i can meet my father
mother i was acknowledged
i was acknowledged first time
i don't know why or what to do
i'll must get his acknowledgement
and find my father and i'll stand straight
i'll find myself
are you ok are you hurt
i heard that someone got caught stealing stones
i figured it was you and released you
did you get hit were you hit
no
what are these scars and the stones
it's all for you
me why me
the mushroom that we barbequed on stone
that reminded me
that got me thinking ondol
ondol
come and check this out
everything is because of you
you taught me to read
i only found out annual ring
but you advised me the shape of grain
and you barbequed and ate mushroom
now you're happy that i'm here
well it's not
that's not it why did you come again
i won't come here again
are you here to say that
no
i have something else
i moved to
jingak temple
and to learn the study of nature from duke seodong
i'd like to teach you confucianism
come here at every 5 in the morning
remember you don't love a woman who you use polite language
so i'll change i'll respect you with my words
you deserve to be respected
i'll treat it as yes if you come i'll be waiting
no
i'll wait until you come
think about it carefully
i didn't do it
if not who did it
i'm not too certain
find it out  yes sir
and princess sunhwa came to jingak temple
jingak jingak temple right
yes she came to study more about nature and things
yes
princess
now you're not going out by yourself
yes instead
i'll do it for you and this isn't right
a few days ago princess and fool anectdote
got spreaded all over
doesn't it sound scary
yes it is i tremble inside too
you do so just
i tremble if he won't come
i remember he asked me to give princess sunhwa
i treated it as a joke
but they're already grown up
plus both of them achieved big merits
they're very trustful very trustful
i'm very sorry i didn't know meeting was held
we gathered how to set up ondol for king
you shouldn't you shouldn't go doctor
i and jang have to go to set it up right
but looking at the letter
guard wanggoo is not free of general's surveillance
and you go by yourself
then what if send jang alone
that is ridiculous
who knows what he'll do
then how about me and jang
nonsense
this is not the same as imparting techniques
we have to set the ondol avoiding general's eyes
but it's king's health
if king is not well we can't go back to baekjae
but it's not right
we should inform them charcoal that giroo found out
and we should consider the situation
silla baekjae commoner princess
i couldn't find wild ginseng but eat this
i barely found it
i got you again didn't i
i won't
so please let me go
remember you don't love a woman who you use polite language
so i'll change i'll respect you with my words
you deserve to be respected
ok let's go let's go
stay still
i said stay still stay still
what is going on  jang caught him
who are these people
doctor
what is it  these are suspicious people
crown prince  crown prince
crown prince
crown prince
dr mok rasoo get up
crown prince
have a seat
i heard you went to japan
how did you get here
10 years ago didn't i have nightmare on the ship
so i took a boat coming to silla
yes brilliant idea
and i have a favor for you
a favor
personally you're my master
master
the master of taehaksa takes charge on prince's education
but secret evaluation and acknowledgement from doctors
would have great influence for prince's future
therefore i became unwanted one the crown prince
what do you mean
no acknowledgement is needed in this position
and i didn't want it in the first place
and i don't think i have potential
but you told me
that is the potential of a great king
if you still think that please support me
where bu yeosun can't reach
train secret military and take charge of suburban power
be my tactician and soldier
doctor mok
prince that  why why
are you trying to say the principle of taehaksa
yes sir i can't have other position as a doctor
we handle very important skill of baekjae
so the work can be used in politics
and the reason why doctors who take charge of prince
cannot be involved in any kind of political activity
and baekjae wants to raise their princes without evil mind
i know i know
now i'm in very difficult situation
so are you and if we break its rule
people will treat taehaksa the way of becoming authority
i cannot do that
doctor  crown prince
then supply weapons and other skills
current taehaksa can't even support that to me
yes majesty that's my job
i'm terribly sorry sir
i know i know what you mean
i know
i'll do it i'll try it
i've received king is in critical condition i was on my way
i've no idea whether it's true or bu yeosun's plot
i'm going to check
it is true sir
what
i'm glad you came i'm so gald
we were worried
how to deliver prescription we found
follow me i'll explain on the way
you can come with me jang
is this called ondol  yes
this will improve king's health
we think so
really who thought of this
this kid
really
what's your name
i'm jang
jang
take him with you
i see this depends on king's health
we don't have time let's leave
what is this map
provision of war to protect skills of baekjae
these are the secret agents of taehaksa residences
right we had one
it's their help that we got here safely in silla
without getting caught
if you give this pendant and letter they'll help you
i got it
this is crucial luggage
there are immediate medicine for king
yes
bu yeosun who drive us out here and killed your mother
we don't know where he might watch you
escort the prince safely
yes
ondol is definitely brilliant idea
when we arrive give medicine to guard wanggoo
and you prepare ondol  yes sir
when you return after this you'll be an engineer
king is waiting for us off you go
yes
take care of yourself
don't worry
time will come to call you people very soon
it is natural you wouldn't want to come back
that kid he is not normal
then why do you like abnormal kid
i i like that
try to penetrate the impossible
try to push the impossible i like him
so he will come
he will come after thinking enough
how did song go
it starts to spread
even though we publicized that it was mok's consipiracy
people kept on thinking that
heaven rejected my father's coronation 10 years ago
isn't that why you ask me to spread a song
its story is that bu yeogye is the emperor from heaven
do not worry it'll be fine this time
i have power over the aristocrats
but the reason why they can't put my father for king
isn't it because of lineal descent
yes lineal descent
i also want to have it
don't worry this time
if aja is dead
we've a problem sir
what is it
prince aja didn't get on the ship we sent
what
his guards and engineers were on board
it looked like prince was on board as well
then then where did he go
it seems he got on the boat to silla
silla  yes
then is he coming by land route
i'll dispatch military soldiers now
no not military soldiers send our private men
yes  and use silla
if aja dies disguise his death in silla
he didn't get on our ship so it's trustful
yes sir
hurry if he went to silla he should be in baekjae by now
no he should be here in capital
yes
send my men to aja's friends' residence
yes
send capital and suburban
don't let anyone to contact with prince aja
you must isolate him beforehand  yes
we can use mok rasoo's secret organization
yes i got it
not this time no
this time
write all the places when you go down to haneuljae
are you talking about secret residents
yes
write everything don't leave out single place
write everything
each group leaves to the destination
the person you have to assassinate is
prince aja
plus you have to leave some evidence
that it has to look like silla people have done it
this is the opportunity that god has given us
whoever kills aja and bring back
his necklace for the evidence
i'll reward him greatly
dismiss now
is anyone here
who are you
come in please
we'll protect you safely
i'll take care of here you leave with prince now
we're silla people
they're disguised
were you here
are you ok  yes i'm fine
you should go now  yes
i can't be relaxed with my friend's place
what do we do
if dongchak can  who is it
he used to manage my horse suhoma
now he got old and working in stable
inguen is  is he royal
we have obscure relation because of horse
i can trust that man
but i and jang don't know his face
what's the color of the horse
are you sir dongchak
yes i am who are you
i have a letter for you
a letter from whom
you'll know when you read it
tell him i got it
i'll deliver it quikcly
this is the natal horse
yes he is
the horse is white but he died last fall
i was told to bring him in  alright
it is very dangerous situation you have to be quiet
yes i know fortunately i'm old so i'll be easy
get him get him  get him
what how this
what's wrong
this isn't mine mine has number 1 engraved
the place is already seized already
what should we do
it's too difficult for our position
even if you go in i can't guarantee your safety
then
how about we do this
you lost them twice
i'm very sorry
plus if they showed up in stable
it means they are near capital somewhere
but their location is exposed
if we besiege from the center
surely it can be done
it must not be known that i'm involved in this
if anyone finds out that has to be killed
do you understand  of course
song is already spreading wide
failure it must proceed without failure
yes
have you heard about slander
slander do you know about this
it's not that
what is not
outside the capital of pond
16 turtles have floated in order
what does it mean
no idea
i just copied the words from the turtles back
one mountain and two months
one house one sun
two mountains and two months
one house and one sun
one mountain and two months
demise
king will die
what do we do
that turtle slander is rapidly spreading
how in what meaning
that
that
demise
if emperor dies
one house one sun
one
house
day
day
sun
bu yeosun
it's me
that is me
if emperor dies it's sun who did it
if emperor and prince dies that's sun too
i did it
i me
i killed emperor and prince
have you heard it
bu yeosun did that to king
did he really do that king
yes  that is big
bu yeosun will kill prince aja

i'll make them to come and escort you
i'll make you them to protect you with your soldiers
what happened do you this pendant

if emperor dies it's sun who did it
if emperor and prince dies that's sun too
it's me
i killed emperor and prince
bu yeosun did that to king
did he really do that king
yes  that is big
how would world be
bu yeosun will kill prince aja
really
anyway emperor is in critical condition and prince's missing
really
it's so mysterious
how do 10 turtles float like that not even one turtle
and it floated in letter order
that's why it's mysterious
it must be revelation
kill king and prince to become an emperor should not happen
of course
what are you doing together
whoever spreads rumor will be punished by law
dismiss now
i'll make them to come and escort you
i'll make you them to protect you with your soldiers
this is nonsense
already slander took palce that gen bu will become a king
if slander that general killed king and prince
no people will accept father
and also us
and i can't hold the authority either
me neither
call heuk chipyung call him
dalsol he lead soldiers
what
go
what seems
it's been changed
when when did it happen
when assassins tried to harm me they tried to find gemstone
they tried take it from me
but i think this got switched around with theirs
but my lord
king's eldest son and second son bu yeopyung
and prince bu yeogeum who died young
how could it have number 4 on the gemstone
i don't know
jang
i came back
did it go as you thought
yes i adjusted the quantity of salt
as salt dissolved in water i made turtles float in order
people found it very amazed and they spreaded words
your thought should have been right
it should be right
before we spread words
general's slander was all over the street
what what slander what kind
that sir bu yeogye is the son of god
anyway you stayed here too long
i found a place to stay on the way
you can stay there for tonight and enter a palace tomorrow
how did you lead commissioned officers down here
did you find aja
yes i'm waiting for report of his death
remove soldiers  yes
remove them now  but
where is he which side
you bastard do you know who i am
prince
you're sun
we were driven out here killing your mother is bu yeosun
you were in great danger
it's so fortunate you're well
since you come through silla silla assassins pursued you
but don't worry i'll protect you to the palace
please get on the horse
prince it must have been a long way to here
are you well  are you well
i'm fine but on the way i heard strange rumor
one of the rumor is that uncle becomes a king
another one is that bu yeosun is trying to kill me and lord
prince i think that's a strategy to
i think it's estrangement
however it must trouble any confusion to people
therefore i won't be going to japan for a while
and national dscretion that uncle handled
until my lord improves his health i'll be on charge
will you be fine uncle
yes you must do that
i'm just a replacement until prince comes back
prepare lord's the ondol room  yes
i sent message to come back so he'll be here soon
he'll be tired coming from far
yes sir
i got here safely because of you
and now i'm flexible to move
i truly thank you
it's nothing sir i should go and prepare sir
ok
4 brother 4 brothers
we totally lost it
whose trap it might be
it should be aja's father in law jinryu
on the way to silla they had mutual communication
and they planned this
i've watched him throughly
they put their lives on this war just like us
the problem is that prince aja is showing his will
what is that
it's the room to take care of king
they brought a craftman from japan
they came with him
it is very mysterious
here is the lord
i heard doctor sent some medication
yes sir decoction is ready now
alright bring it later
yes lord
my lord please lay down
you came back alive
lord
without seeing you
without inherit my position i was afraid to die
i was afraid that i can't do that much
lord why do you say such a weak thing
now you have me i'll be next to you
yes yes your words make me cured already
what's wrong something happened
lord
what is it
this is the only symbol that prince of baekjae can carry
if you give birth a son give it to him
how did you
what's the story with it
what happened do you this pendant
i can't look at you properly
lord it's very normal to have a grandson
where is this kid
when i try to find him
he was belong to unreachable place
there's no way to find him
where is he
where is he
he seems he's dead
what
before you find him bu yeosun found him first
he's on their hand
i met those assassins and i might have been into trouble
from there mine and his are switched
prince here is king's decoction
alright
smoke must not come into ondol room
please let us search it first
you'll do that
it's my sin it's my sin
my son my son
lord anyone there call doctor call doctor
what is it
dr mok said this medicine can be used
wisely on spasmodic cough
princess you should go this time
the messenger day is held in seorabul
6 countries messengers are coming
in that event chunmyung and dukman princesses take
charge of two nations and preparing already
if you want to i was told you can take two nations
why aren't you going
not going i told you i'm not going
princess silla provides woman to take a big part of nation
and only blood to retain legitimacy is
princess chunmyung and dukman and you
anyhow one of princess will inherit the position of empreor
and empreor is now testing
three of you one by one
and i'm ordered to assist you
so why don't you listen what i say
princess chunmyung already married with duke youngchun
she's expanding her strength
don't you have any interest in politic
no i have interest
so it's more important to be here
i'll do it with my own way and all strategies are there
the information about two nation
you know what to do
why did you make lady bomyung so angry
plus arrows that you used are over 30 now
it won't come any more
i'll wait until arrows last
it's 12 left
are you going to palace if it doesn't come in 12 days
yes i'll go
king is getting really better
yes sir
so i'll return my position
your ondol and your slander saved me and king
it's too much
if you agree i want to have you next to me
what do you think of it
i really appreciate your kindness but i have to go back
a reason to go back
yes i must go back
alright then deliver this letter to dr mok
and tell haneuljae people that
i'll take whatever to bring you people back to palace
yes sir
come at every 5 in the morning
i'll treat it as yes if you come i'll be waiting
no i'll wait until you come think about it carefully
isn't it too late
isn't it too late
father  yes doham how have you been
let's have a seat
what made you come down here
i've received report that a big mine is here in dalbul
so i might stay here for a while
yes
and i have things to say to you
what kind
did you know princess sunhwa is staying at temple here
yes
she has important role in this messenger day
she doesn't want to come
why not
maybe she's too young
to see king's intention to test 3 princesses
or either she's not interested in governing
that's not it i know so
so i'm telling you
it's good to shine you and forget about mission in haneuljae
since one of princess is married aristocrats are flurried
as i heard from the rumor
a few aristocrats are making a move to get princess
that's why i couldn't wait for you to finish your mission
if possible reveal yourself and come to this event together
if you shot we have 8 left
you're incredible
although i gave you these
i couldn't think you'll do this good
has anyone taught you
when you get to learn archery
it's not easy to stand straight to the target
yes it's not easy
and also holding the breathe while pulling the archer
if you concentrate on taget without any thinking
and shot whole world would be shot
when i shot the whole world is shot
yes that trust and confidence
will fly arrow to the target with accuracy
trust and confidence
yes turst and confidence
the trust and confidence that you can shot the whole world
trust and confidence
yes i shouldn't throw it away i shouldn't
why did you move from woonjung to jingak temple
i got interested in the study of nature
i heard this place is the best
yes
what's your biggest interest in study of nature
well that
isn't it rice crop
yes this is the most important study of nature
in our future and silla
why rice crop among all other rich crops
our agriculture method is too poor
but looking at its flavor and use
this crop will dominate the era
and also the reason why baekjae is better than silla
is that they have undeniable advance agriculture method
whoever increases the production of rice
and who will have the most fertile land
would hold the key of authority among 3 nations
rice
they eat soil multiple times of their body and out excrement
this land is dead because of salt
but earthworm's fertile can antidote this land
i know that guy
really
yes i know a man who will arise the agriculture
then you must make him your people
yes
yes i should
what's wrong grandma
what is wrong
i'm ok  get on my back
get on my back
what even grandpa
yes
was this quite often
yes
at first his body was swollen and little fever
since one day his joints were all swollen
and he's out of breathe
did his symptoms got worse on humid day
huh
yes i think so
on flood season he nearly died
it's damp disease
huh damp disease
now there are 6 left
i have been shot
you
your heart became thousands of arrows and it shot me
but i can't
my arrows weren't shot at you
miss
someone is here for you and he wants you to come to a room
who is it man or woman
it's a man
who were you waiting
no no
what do you want
i can't shot the target what should i do
your mind and body didn't become one
no i united it
it's the reason of life and foundation i united it
then you didn't hold your breathe
no i was holding my breathe
no it got stopped naturally
then change the target
sorry
there's a target which doesn't suit you
it's not that your skill went down or didn't practice
it's just not your target to shot
if i were you i'd change it rather than lose my confidence
more important thing is myself
honestly i came to show you my target
this is my target
this pot
yes it's my dream
dream
and the person who will plant the dream is you
what me
i don't quite get
it's really warm and nice how about you
good very good
you can do put fire as i taught you
you can get medicine as i wrote it down
thank you young man thank you
i know we're sick
but we were more worried about freezing weather in winter
thank you
it's ok i'd better get moving
i really appreciate you should
beans have some beans
i'm fine
then
oh you shouldn't leave like this
it's ok grandma i have to go somewhere
stay little longer
take care of yourself
grandma where is the guy
we want to learn that ondol thing
he left  what
why did you let him my mother has the same infection
i know i told him to stay
there's a target which doesn't suit you
i gotta hear it
i gotta hear it myself whether it doesn't really suit me
archer means power and rice means people
the archer and rice are one that i agonized last 10 years
also there are two reasons why i agonize
the iron pot and nation nation of princess
it's the way to obtain silla with you
and that princess gave me that dream
that's the dream i thought of when i first saw her
it's my dream because i love you princess
i've never seen people eating yam
nor the meaning of abundance but you gave me the dream
i'm the one who couldn't offer 10 years ago in najeong ceremony
i'm kim doham
princess
what do i do
princess princess
i came a long way
i left with agony that if you change your mind
but i'm relaxed
i'm relaxed because my mind gets firm as times go by
i got relaxed having trust that you will have the same feeling
is this trust love
the desire to see you is love
i'll come back at the same time
2 months that i couldn't come seems to be shorter than today
who did you wait
no no
nobody can be except me
watch the princess
don't ever take your eyes off watch her clearly
a guy will come and go find out
yes sir
jang is back he's back
jang is back  jang
jang is back  where
are you alright
yes but there were assassins everywhere
how about prince aja
he safely arrived at palace
what about lord
he made it to palace too
what about his health
i provided him ondol
i saw improvement with medication and charcoal i brought
he told me to deliver this letter
and tell all of you that he'll do anything to bring us back
are we able to go back
well done well done
that's why he's our jang
well done you were anxious
well done
is he the engineer now
of course yes
if he escape the dark cave with focus and penetration
he can definitely be the one
is it true can he be the one
yes now jang is engineer of
haneul no baekjae taehaksa
concentrate further with pride and dignity
i'll keep it in my heart i will
giroo things that jang couldn't learn so far
help him out to acquire quickly
yes
now back to your work  yes
teach me a lot
no i have to be taught
since i became member of haneuljae
you're the first one to make me jealous and burn
i'll teach you knowledge
but i'll learn your focus and penetration towards the study
thanks if not you
if you didn't drag me out of 10 years hole
i'll still be lost in the hole
you were right
you'll be a great leader like dr mok
if they're stupid enough i'd mock them
but since they're bright enough it looks good
will circle around without shot anything
and why do you break left arrows
stop it
what is it
put them
be careful with neck bone
sir
is anything wrong what's going on
first the great senior of our engineers
mack dosoo bow to him
from now on the rule it's more strict than haneuljae
i'll present the rule of engineer
first when we eat we are one we eat and live together
second when we play we are one we play together
third this is the most important
when we opposed to ms mojin we're one
four mojin and i must be tied
dad that's not it
i gotta live too
is that all
it sounds easy but it's not
ok it won't be easy but i'll try
what is it
i said what is it
only king can drink
the best of all liquor hansanso crop liquor
what are you talking about finish your sentence
the best of all liquor hansanso crop liquor
give me some
that's not it
come on doc don't be harsh
don't drink too much
who who would it be
hey you got liquor give me some
liquor
i said bring it here they must have odered you to do things
please just hand it over
here
letter is it love letter
i thought i was gonna die
this is why i do all the stuff in somebody's nation
that's right
anyway doctor seemed to be quite a normal guy
there's my deep heart in that
have it
guys something wrong with jang
right even i drank it all and he hasn't had much yet
here
cheers everyone
for unity of engineers we opposed to mojin
let me you jang
do you know what this is
no what is it
is that you
the person who left ondol he'll be rewarded him
is it you
yes it is me
are you out of your mind
we have the duty of security of our technology
nation obtains benefit diplomatic relation
that it'll help our people
didn't you know it's the law of baekjae
didn't you know
i understand
then
i thought looking after people comes first priority of the duty
if i took weapon method i understand
but they were dying for damp disease
they're people of silla
people of silla and baekjae they are all people
the most important principle of 7 rule is
all scientific technology toward human being
so the study of nature shouldn't have any border
but the practicer has the country
people comes first
from the result baekjae lost superiority of diplomacy
and wealth and power from the ondol
in the end you helped the enemy
but the patient lived
in the end i helped a human
your words are ideal but mine is reality
i cannot accept that reality
you must accept it
i cannot accept it
you must  i cannot
then you can't be here
i cannot accept it
don't make a move and think about it
and when you can accept it tell me
doctor is right that's just ideal
so tell him you accept it and ask for forgiveness
i want to see princess
so i want to accept it
but if you do that you won't be able to see her
to distinguish people of baekjae and silla
and infection of king and silla servants
while i can treat king the medication
but i can't treat people of silla if i accept this foundation
how can i as a servant love princess
how can i love silla princess when i'm baekjae people
so i'll stand still
i'll stand to put my foundation in my heart and go to her
please wait for me
please wait for me
please believe in me
the way it's longer than from baekjae to silla
please walk with me
did a strange man come here
no nobody came he acts weirdly
act weird
she won't eat anything and goes around steeple

she won't listen to anyone
what
princess
princess
princess
princess
dip your feet in warm and cold water by turns
and i'm going so untie him please
yes
get this herbs
yes
and ask the maid secretly
the man certainly involved in this
yes
i'm going nuts nuts
you drive me insane i'm going psycho
is this because the man
how did you
who are you
lady maya sent me to protect princess secretly
how did you know she's a princess
didn't i say i was sent secretly
now confess the truth
no it's just
speak now otherwise lady maya is certain
and i have to explain this situation to the lord
but i'll consider princess's nonor and i'll cover it up
i want to do it quietly so talk to me
are you certain
i swear
last time on that idle incident
the guard who thought of earthworm
is also spreaded seodongyou
how's the maid of lady maya
you mean dalgi
yes dalgi  she's fine
you're not a messenger dalgi is my sister
i'm very sorry
this is letter from my father i couldn't hand in to you
sedongyou earthworm
who could it be who could it be
do you accept it
i cannot accept it
princess
you really exasperate me
get the carriage  pardon
i'm going to palace
but after you must rest before
if not now i don't think i can go
if this is your will i will respect that
prince wrote how you escorted him
to the palace
go to prince aja
go to baekjae
i don't want to
i can't handle you
as mojin said either you're very dangerous person
or very important person
that's why i can't handle you
you invented ondol without taking care of you and others
i can handle that
with your clear subjectivity and benefiting the enemy
and brilliant tactian that you thought of slandering
that i cannot handle
second is that when i see you i see your mother
the love i gave her and the pain she left in me
two things flash my mind
therefore i cannot cope with you any more
i'm very proud when you show amazing talent of the study
but when you're in danger i think of pain she gave me
so i can't forgive you
that's why i can't be your master
but prince would treat you differently
evidently he'll comprehend your two talents
and make you a great man
so please go
i can't do that
i want to leave but i cannot do that
i don't understand why she
asked me to get acknowledgement from you
whether it means to be just a great man
or it has to be your acknowledgement i can't be sure
i have to follow that every words of her
that's the only way to stand in front of my father
whose son i am or who really i am
and why i should have two different side of me
it's the lonely way to figure it out
i need your acknowledgement dr mok
your cherish heart and spiteful heart
so please just show me as it is
if the nature is convivial to humans
humans would have never been civilized
the nature brought disaster with weather
humans have accomplished the civilization
so i will grow from your two side of heart
that's why i'll be acknowledged
please accept me
go to your cottage and get some rest
you have to rest so you can study more about nature
the hero of seodongyo and earthworm who could it be
doham i'm writing to let you know a strange thing

when mother died my heart was boiling
when i first saw you
as soon as i saw you my heart was calmed
and 10 years
when i achieved nothing i was lost and my heart was cold
i saw you again princess
when i saw you my heart was burning
with the burning heart i found myself again
and i knew it was all because of your help
i disobeyed you and came back here again
even i neglected you
to find myself which i have lost
you were next to me without a word
you helped encouraged and acknowledged me
and even respect me with your words
every moment and every places
i will not neglect that you were with me all the time
i do not want to neglect that i've always thought of you
but princess
to follow my heart something stopped me

i have a secret
a secret please tell me
i cannot tell you no matter what
i can accept anything please tell me
not this please allow it
we shouldn't have that in between us

it's the reason to drive bumsang to death
and again it's betrayal of haneuljae
you don't trust me yet
princess why are you so late
i pretended that you were sick
and i had to play as you
i'll tell you i'll tell you
it's alright it's fine
if you can't tell me there must be a reason
why are you doing this to me
people say i'm not a trustful person
but how can you say it's ok
people say i'm disrespectful
how can you say it's alright
people say i'm dangerous
unstable impulsive foolish
how can you  because i trust you
i know you're a big person
clearly at the idle incident it was disrespectful and unstable
but your idea underneath it was big
neverthless the pressure of arrows you took off
certainly it was impulsive and foolish
but focusing on work achieving it and intention was deep
i'll do it for you
two things i must achieve
i have to be acknowledged from master of haneuljae
find out who i am and my identity is my way
and the way with you
both ways are rough and unbearable to me
also those are so contrary
it can't be done at the same time but i'll do it for you
please watch unstable person like me become deep and grown
because of you i'll be the one with you
and i'll do the same
unstable myself will grow up with you
because of you i'll become one with you
he'll be here in villege resident so deliver this

engineer mack dosoo
i have 30 years experience
please take this class out
30 years of listening and what
potter has to make pottery well nothing else
what kind of torture is this
study other section and apply it to your profession
this is learning system
you always skip it that's why no improvement in pottery
how about dyeing on pottery
no
or have you tried to make a dye from pottery
well i didn't try
that's why you're an technician for 30 years
it sounds all right
but i'm just like that you know can you let me go
no not until i'm here
i've seen a lot of people' fate but mine is really odd
i'm glad you came
is anything wrong
i have to teach jang about plating gold in private lesson
i'm not too well you can replace me
yes please rest
yes
specially plating is mercury and mercury is toxic chemical
make sure you don't go near where it's boiling
yes
i didn't know lesson is this fun
how about dr mok he told me to teach me something
i'm dong it  really what
i'm going to plate bronze bell
plate then do you mean you can plate gold powder only
yes
how do you do it
mix gold powder with mercury
filter it through paper
this is gold powder material
and paste this on the surface of paper
and then put it on the fire place and heat it up
follow me
no it's dangerous
mercury is toxic chemical
when you heat it mercury evaporates and leaves gold powder
so when you heat it you have to be far from it
really
i'll teach you confucianism
so duke seodong can teach me the study of nature
what why didn't you deliver it

to save princess sunhwa while risking your life
thank you for being alive
is he alive
yes one of haneuljae comrade saved me
i was worried
so was i
didn't i tell you it was dangerous
why did you do that
i thought you went wrong because of me
i was so worried don't do it next time
so don't ever make joke about bitten by snake
it really happened
i'd better get moving
already
i don't want to see you i'm going to study
you shouldn't wander around now
i'm fine
and thank you
you helped me twice
it's nothing
the person i asked you to save
yes he's safe
yes the person
i think his identity seems lower than you
how come your words are respectful to him
even though his identity is lower but i respect him
at first i judged people on their identity
and i thought i could do anything to hi
but his focus was so perversed on the study
and he treated people with his true heart
and his determination
i said unecessary things
considering what you've said
i thought you wouldn't be anxious
that made me to say so
making silla back in line is that kind of person
not the hierarchy isn't it
i can only let in my heart is that kind of person
i heard about it from goosan
please pretend massacre wan't even mentioned
i was too impulsive
that's good if you changed your mind
anyway it's not the right time
although i mentioned it's good to come back quickly
you already swore it even in front of king
if you can't keep your words as hwarang it's ashamed
and taking methods and information out to silla
king was very satisfied with it
plus the secret book of agricultural method of baekjae
king is even waiting for it
this is the obstacle you must go through
yes i understand
i also want to keep all my words
and want to stand in front of princess sunhwa honorably
yes you should
instead i'll finish it soon
as soon as possible
yes you should
you should yes yes
unnegotiable king is presented
princess sunhwa will be out of his sight
that can't happen
that can't happen
9 to go if i do 9 more i'll be a doctor
do it let me massacre here and end bad relation
something happened during the messenger day
it's fine now
it's crisis to hurt your body please take care of your body
yes
is mother well
yes lady maya is always worried about princess
she's upset that princess didn't attend the event
i want to see her but how about lord
he wasn't angry but she'll be called in soon
then i
i have nothing to ask you
having found out about earthwormin idle incident
and inventing ondol how much would his merits count
that is big merits
then would his hierarchy upgrade
generally that much merits
normal commoner can be first do rank
if he isn't a commoner if not a commoner of silla
what if he's a slave or slave of soo
it would be quite different
if he is needed in silla king will make him silla people
making him
foreign people who migrated to silla
we examined them and give out right hierarchy
really is there a such thing
of course unless he disobey all 3 countries
we're very open if they are certain of naturalization
yes it's right it's right for silla's bright future
did you call me
yes i want you to go to the palace
to the palace
10 years ago slaves who chased messengers of soo
there was an incident of group escape
most of them were arrested and returned
luckily people who supplied goods on palace are remained
i didn't know about it at all
so i'm telling you to find out
how they ended up supplying goods
and they could have been sent
find out how they end up dead
yes
and find any records
look for interviewer at that time and ask him thoroughly
yes
princess what are you planning to do
what are you talking about
an assassin sent to taehaksa saw another gemstone
while he was dying
saw another one another person had one
or aja had two of those
he just said that and died
it doesn't make sense that aja had two of those
nor other person had it
that means there's a prince who we don't know
prince aja might plan things to do something
3 years after the incident i tried to look for him
but bu yeosun found out already
that's why they had it on their hands
what's the dancer's name
it's yeon gamo
yeon gamo
why did yeon gamo want jang to be acknowledged from me
what would it mean
how dose it relate to find his real father
what are you thinking about
what is it
i'd like to know the subject of dye skill
i thought you were focused in plating and agriculture method
i have to know other part of study
to graft in my special area of study
it seems i'm going through stagnant
dyeing workshop subject is always one
our country has a lot of boil and swelling
so find out good fabric for skin and considering good color
it'll be much better if you find out a new color
yes i'll try it
what are these medical books here
oh this
ms mojin told me to find good dye for skin and color
first i'm looking for good medication for skin from the book
instead of looking it randomly
it'll be better to classify good medicines for skin
here i read them all
are you trying to invent a new color
yes
i tried but it's all brown
there are many dyes to have brown instead of rare medicine
so it won't work will it
no it won't
this has to work
right
shall we try together
no doing it separately makes various ways
not this
this this is
why what did i do wrong
right
this this
this will make white much whiter and clear on other colors
it does
so did you see the new color
no one
what dye is it
this is indigo
indigo what
it's good for damp and keep mold and vermin
did you do it with indigo
yes
how did you do it
unlike other dyes indigo has to get fresh latex
and you have to dye it immediately
immediately
yes color will change under the air
that's hard to dye it then
right it's good to have time to gossip
and do other stuff as well
the blind points make people to find it hard to use
i can get rid of the blind points
how did you make that with
what kind of dyes can make this nice color
this is indigo
is this indigo as well
what's that indigo then
wow it's so lovely
there's a few dyes that can make blue color
but this is too fine
how did you do it
jang said if not do it fast color will change
there are two significance
first is too decompose it
decompose
decompose it
put this in and decompose it for 2 days
since color changes too fast i wondered to leave it like this
aren't there many foods among 3 nations that
when it's decomposed flavor and property are changed
there are alcohol and vinegar
so i tried it
and it became this dark green
when you dye green does it become fine navy
no that's the second significance
don't it use to dye well
that is very common
no it's not wood ash it's burnt oyster shell
oyster shell
it's commonly used to have clear color of fabric
put the ash in and stir it like this
at first it's yellow then green then after it's blue
but it has to go until bubbles are gone
and then
if you
and then if you repeat itjust like other dyes
you can get much fine color
it's incredible
dyeing its water worms won't eat or moth won't lay eggs
especially good at children's congenital fever
this is notjust a finding of dye
the method of dye can be changed based on this
jang let's wrap it up
doctor i want to investigate further on rice crop
rice crop
yes so i'd like to go around silla
and compare where was more harvested or not
yes it's harvesting season take jang with you
yes
where should we go
i'll go up and you go to dalbul villege
can't we go together
we need more samples to compare
by the way are you mad at me
no nothing like that
have you found out
yes i did but i couldn't get any information
couldn't get any
there are records of slaves of soo
but no records of four people were dead
no records
i asked around and it's top secret
so limited people can see that in the palace
4 people separately  yes
other slaves of soo can be seen
yes

yes but he's in dalbul villege now

did you tell people to release the man who made fake id
i'm not sure

yes
i didn't have any other mean

there must be a misunderstanding
you don't know him
well i don't know him
do you remember investigating slaves of soo 10 years ago
well
i can't remember what happened 10 years ago
why would kim saheung release him
why would he release slave who ran away

as i checked military records quietly
all the fugitives from soo were all caught and sent
what
how about people who got caught and died
they aren't slaves of soo
it seems they are not
nobody knows about it or keep their mouths shut
it seems not
then then
it must have been serious
i'm sorry to make this happen

a citizen of baekjae
finally king will do my favor episode 12
favor
i'm not sure of your favor
you would never leave people of here
so i asked a favor
all your family can be free from slave of soo
and have permission to work in imperial workshop
the position is high enough
soldiers and officers will come tomrrow morning
we all can go to seorabul
aren't you happy
what's wrong aren't you happy
no please take it back
i don't want to i can't do that
you have to come to the palace with me
no if we do that
we're all gonna die
i'm not a slave of soo
i am i am
people of baekjae
what did you just say
did you say you're people of baekjae
did you really say you're people of baekjae
yes but
then all haneuljae people are baekjae people
people who died because of me
they were people of baekjae too
yes
the pendant that you gave me
it's the pendant of taehaksa baekjae
my mother was a dancer of taehaksa
i'll tell you
secrets that you couldn't tell me
yes
please listen to me
please listen to me
you must listen to me please listen what i'm saying
you lied to me
you came to silla to spy on us pretending supply goods
did they make you to get close with me
no it's not like that
i swear it wasn't like that
if not what is it
i can't forgive you i can't forgive you
no you gotta listen to me
get out of my way
i can't do that
wow what a woman
we don't have that woman in haneuljae
are you talking to yourself
why are you doing this
he shouldn't do that
he shouldn't do that
i can't let you go
i know your secret are you trying to kill her
princess we didn't come here to spy silla
we're abandoned by baekjae
the person i have to get acknowledged from is
the master of taehaksa doctor mok rasoo
but 10 years ago
the coronation of bu yeogye was ruined for some reason
his son bu yeosun
treated dr mok as a leader who ruined the coronation
and ordered masscare
we ran away and got here silla
during the run my mother was killed
and the reason of supplying goods to palace is that
i was caught as a slave of soo by misbehaving
while doctor tried to save me from them
his brilliant skill was recognized that's how it began
we have never done any sorts of spying
nobody knows that i'm seeing you either
because of bu yeosun
we lost our families and escaped to here in silla
the nation baekjae abandoned us
but we're just people who can't abandone their nation
therefore i can't let you go like this
i can die but i can't let someone die again because of me
killl me and please leave them alone
anyway if you don't accept me
i have no means in my life
but like this you can't go like this
you can't go like this
princess
i'll take care of the rest you just keep your mouth shut
yes
if hierarchy is the problem i'll be the king of baekjae
if the problem is that i'm not silla people
then i'll unite baekjae and silla
it can't be done from the first place
nobody agreed or thought it was possible seeing you
i was going to do that
no one ever acknowledged me
i was impulsive and dangerous but you acknowledged me
you gave your heart and took away mine
i was going to do that
giving your heart to me means this
it's not me who lied you're the one
you lied to me
don't pretend you didn't know this
including this undescribable and undeniable things
happened many times to us
finally knowing that i'm baekjae people your mind was to
get rid of me i can tell
is it not true
is it not true
is it not true
stop it
princess
didn't you say it's not too far becoming a doctor
yes i'm doing my best
as fast as i can
i'll inherit the book and finish this
you must be tired
right i understand
you could live so comfortably
you spent many years to
but doham
when i was in dalbul princess came to see me
pardon why she visited you
the kind name jang in haneuljae
yes
when i was in villege
he got in trouble carrying fake id
so i release him
then princess came and asked me if i knew him
and how i released him
so did you tell him
no but when i went to palace
her guard came to palace to ask 10 years ago incident
does she happen to know about haneuljae
jang it's because of jang
perhaps she's trying to upgrade jang's identity
i have to go now
leave haneuljae and come with me
you can do it
i can't do that
when my mother was dying she left her will
that's the necklace i showed you
she had something
and she didn't say anything about father
the necklace is the only thing that
my father left for me
and she told me to go to dr mok
to get acknowledged from him
getting acknowledged from him leads to find my father
and when i turn 20 we agreed to meet
but she was killed
to the only path that i know myself
the only path i can be honorable when i found my father
what mother taught me was just dr mok rasoo
i can't leave
do you want me to do that
i will show you i can do this
two things i must achieve
i have to be acknowledged from master of haneuljae
find out who i am and my identity is my way
and the way with you
both ways are rough and unbearable to me
also those are so contrary
it can't be done at the same time but i'll do it for you
please watch an unstable person like me become deep and grown
because of you i'll be the one with you
nothing will happen to haneuljae
i didn't hear or know anything
that means you too
i didn't hear or know you
i'll forget you
your critize was right
i put you next to me and made you to be my guard
i only thought about upgrading your identity
i couldn't think about danger you'd confront because of it
i made a mistake because i'm a fool
i'll admit it and forget you
and i'll do what princess does
you go your own way
there can't be any mistake
person gives a heart who wouldn't receive it
there's nothing wrong with giving heart to me
it's to give and take
i won't forget you you won't forget me
it won't be done it can't be done
be ready of carriage
where are you going  to the palace
really
i'm not coming back so pack everything
really are you sure we're not coming back
where are you going
yes
where
i'm going home
home will you come back
no i don't think i'm coming back
you've helped me a lot but i won't be seeing you again
yes but if we're destined we'll see each other
perhaps i have a feeling that we will
it's over over
i'm the last one all i need to is finish the mission
jang
you scared the hell out of me
who was she
the woman with nice clothes and pretty smile
ms mojin could have seen her
so i used my body to cover her sight
break up with her
break up because she's a silla woman
you could be in trouble and so are we
she left
she did
yes she left
isn't it fortunate
yes it is fortunate
is it fortunate that her body is left
hey
jang
hey
he said it's fortunate but i don't think so
other person organized it for 15 years
and you shouldn't try to acquire it so easily
it's not like that
doctor is not here nor you do and i didn't know what to do
mix with the ratio tin 1 and copper 99
i'm back where is the doctor
he left to get the baekjae singi
baekjae singi is
he hid it when we were on the run
this time prince aja
told us to add more and send it to him
then baekjae singi is going back to baekjae
i don't know about that
why are you afraid that you can't see it
no
we can go back to baekjae soon don't worry
yes we should when do you come then
not so sure it's been a while
he's going to add on the book so it'll take a few more days
yes
tin 1 and copper 99 would be the same as copper
now mix it 2 to 98
baekjae singi must not be returned
princess is back in business so i have to end with jang
mix it 3 to 97
now 4 to 96
what's wrong  what
why are you doing this to me
why i didn't ask for a wrong thing
this is the basic of doing the study
try and try and tray and try again
to gain what you are willing to desire try and try
since you developed the ondol as if you got the whole world
you think you could do what others are doing without trying
but life isn't that easy
everyone has to work hard with infinitive patience
to achieve their goals gradually
we're not irresponsible and absurd
you bastard
i know you have silla woman in your heart
and she looks high
you don't think about haneuljae nor your hierarchy or situation
you're filled with wild dream you're nothing but a jerk
have you done enough wandering and study
yes
well i had to send you with scandalous reason
but i heard your situation from priest
perhaps i've thought your idea wasn't bad after all
no politic is better than looking around the nation
but you're not a little princess any more
you've watched and got interested in the study of nature
so be charge on naeseong
which handles imperial workshop and goods
now you need time to
will you say 'no' this time
uh huh you won't answer me
yes i'll do it
yes you should
well done
already other princesses are on charge of the affairs
plus naeseong handles trade with other countries
so it's an important department to listen things from outside
i'll look around the palace workshop
yes
you just got here now
it doesn't help you to forget
does silla still import glass from other coutries
no
although we can't make plates
without any joint or delicate
we now make glass with our hands
alright
why is it so shinny
it's a buprestid
silla's buprestid is the best
so it's the best good to trade
since we've been working on papers
we can't have the quality of soo's papers
most of papers used in palace are imported
father
you two need to turn jang's mind
why
you guys are not enough as women
what's wrong with us
anyway you have to turn jang's mind then firstly
jang jang something happened
while you were in baekjae did you know doctor made ondol
i know
you know there  we're all dead
if my mom finds out we're all dead
why what happened
let's go and see  hurry
mack and we hid boiled bean here to eat quietly
but floor got warm and it's all rottne
it's really rotten
do something
i thougth soy bean had mold and i knew it was rotten
it turned out to be great food
but what can i do with this rotten beans
and it stinks like hell
i can't stand it
here it is
hey hey nothing is impossible
it stinks so much that we wanted to throw it away
but who are we we're food experimentors
so we cooked now it's so delicious
see it's not only tasty
having this makes you shit real shit
i thought anaconda is coming out
traditionally if you do no2 well you'll live up 100 years old
drink it and have this
and have real good shit tomorrow morning
say 'shit ' and forget about everything
yes i'm not sure what's going on but i'll forget everything
yes
anyway forgetting is nothing fancy just think you throw it away
i'm ok now maybe it's better
drink it
it's really nice
can he really have hidden son
maybe
anyhow the second prince is weaker than king so we didn't think about him
we can get rid of them anytime
if he has one why did he hide him
it's possible he hide it to prepare our threat
or he may had reason that he can't stand out his son
the reason he couldn't stand him out
does king have that kind of reason
perhaps then
when we returned previous king's head
yeah
back then
my name is yeon gamo
for my solo dance i was practicing
were you just pracitising
your one word
can be treated as treason and untakable disloyalty
how come you don't answer me
someone saw you with king last night
yes the woman at that time
she was a dancer of taehaksa
find it out find it out
is there any move from bu yeosun
no that kid's slander plan had huge impact on them
i think he's afraid of grievance of people
it won't go for long
he'll make his position solid by war
that's why king wants to
have solid relationship between goguryu and silla
yes so i asked him to make addition of baekjae singi
it has all the techniques of baekjae organized
which lead glorious the diplomat of our nation
yes my lord
by this time dr mok would have finished writing one
i'll send somebody soon
it must have been long way
doctor  doctor welcome
yes how have you been
yes we were fine
yes we were very well you've done tough job
that's right
why did stay there so long without telling us anything
it doesn't look like food to me are those books
yes i couldn't think about that
books are food to him
i'm sorry
have you been well
yes
while you were gone giroo wandered around silla
he found out many things about this area's farming field
yes even though it's not big enough
it's so different from baekjae so many things won't be same
i want to hear it
yes
but i don't see jang
why not are you worried he might committed a crime
don't worry
he's stuck in the metallurgy room
he's busy mixing copper and tin in different raito
he doesn't eat
is that so
i think he determined himself
i was curious about the result i want to check it out
no take a rest first look later
alright
but where have you been really
he went to write baekjae singi
baekjae singi
yes i heard it first time
oh you guys weren't in taehaksa like giroo
you guys came straight here
listen carefully baekjae singi is
it contains all techniques of baekjae from ancient time
only chosen royals and doctors can see this book
wow really
as i heard a rumor that the book has the spirit
if anyone can read the book
their fingertips will be burnt
that's not nonsense
it's that much precious and honorable
doctor can we go in
come in
i didn't hear you coming have you finished writing
i was late doing copy
hasn't prince sent a person yet
no
he wanted me to rush so i'm worried i might made a mistake
you'll be fine
but why do you send the book
didn't prince stay in japan for long time
when he returned from japan
he wanted to strengthen the trade to organize the nation
yes
you volunteer this job and i feel so secured
steal the baekjae singi
the baekjae singi is
only chosen royals and doctors can read that book
yes i got it
no matter how long it takes i'll be doctor to get it
i tried to become a doctor to get the book
and now i've done it for 10 years
before it's returned to baekjae i must get it
i must steal it before it's sent and finish up here
i received father's message send an assassin tonight
soon we'll have war with baekjae
so find out any information regarding this
ok i have a message too
what kind
it seems to be over now
huh then
baekjae singi is in haneuljae
and it'll send to baekjae soon
when
i'm not too certain but very soon
then
send a message to my father dispatch our soldiers
that will be a merit
yes i'll deliver it
it's records from naeseong to king
ok you can go
princess you seem you're different person recently
you liked him so much don't you think about him
kim doham is quite amazing
why what did he do
among the people who invents new things to report
there are many kim doham
is he mentioned there too
yes
with his official rank
it's normal to be interested in politics
he seems he's more interested in the study of nature
i'm more curious that
you're interested in people who are interested in study
the guy in
chogi i told you not to mention
ondol
what's wrong
ondol ondol
tell kim doham to come in
yes
ondol how did it happen
it seems that date is too similar to be a coincidence
kim doham kim doham
i'm sure i left it here
why did you come by yourself
there isn't the person who you want to find out in naeseong
he's not there according to the report
there's a person name kim doham with official rank
what are you talking about
anyway i asked officers who work in naeseong
where kim doham work at
nobody has that name
are you saying he's got the position but not his body
maybe
certainly glass craft and ondol are his inventions
here comes princess
welcome princess please sit here
i heard messenger from india is coming
i was going to visit you soon
who is kim doham
why are you looking for him
i saw the records of report to king
i heard he's a big man
yes he is
so i tried to put him closely
but officers in naeseong don't know him
who is he
who is he
honestly he's an agent
agent are you saying he's doing secret mission for king
yes
so i can't discuss any further
you made a visit and you come again
yes my lord i have a curiosity
curiosity
as i was reading the report to you
i found a man who invented many things
who is it
his name is kim doham
oh kim doham
what kind of mission did you order him
developing doesn't involve any mission
no developing and mission don't match
then what kind
now you're doing naeseong work so i must tell you now
in fact 10 years ago when baekjae had political movement
people from taehaksa were on the run
we caught them and tried to concilate but we failed
we ordered them to work for silla and 15 years old
engineer killed himself
so young hwarang kim doham is sent in
no he volunteered himself
he swore that he'll be a doctor himself
and until he steals the book he'd stay there
he's very homage liege and silla must have him
especially you should watch out for him
they knew everything silla knew it all
so after mission is accomplished
what if happens afterward
is this true
yes things will finish in haneuljae
so he wanted dispatched soldiers
alright alright
finally long journey is ending
here comes princess
dismiss now  yes sir
please be seated here
what made you come again
i heard about the mission from king
oh did you
it is a great plan
thank you
he volunteered this job
so i think he must be very royal to king as well as me
yes he is
so i want to see him quickly
when does his mission finish
the man just left here is kim doham
really
i think it'll finish very soon
very soon
yes the book is now in haneuljae
so when he takes it out he'll return
yes then you can't leave them in silla
no we can't leave them
as soon as the book is taken out massacre will be done
i'll dispatch soldiers soon
massacre soon
seodong seodong will be dead
doctor come out for a second
what is it
you must come with me
where to
the place i cultivated indigo  where is it
i'll tell you on the way please follow me
it's here here
it's here
what has happened here
when we dyed indigo wild indigo was short
we asked engineers and trainees
to cultivate a field on the way to jingak temple
yes i and jang found this here
yes
and it has a space to put a letter
then this
more suspicious thing is that there's a narrow path
isn't this the way to your cottage
did you know this
no i didn't know
clearly this is
jang you watch here from the distance
if this is secret post box people will come
yes
bumro can take the shift
yes
and be quiet about this
yes  yes
let's go  yes
it doesn't seem it's plain rock
if it's for secret post box
it means there's insider
silla bu yeosun
baekjae singi is it ok
i think it's in the safest place
the kid who went to seorabul came back
i'll see you there
have you found it
i couldn't find it yet i don't know where it is
it'll be ashamed if it goes to baekjae
i'll find it no matter what
if i can't find it and it returns to baekjae
we have to steal it using our military
so you don't have to use secret stone
now you standby here
yes sir but
what is it
princess came back to jingak temple
what again
yes she arrived today
in fact according to the kid who went to seorabul
princess is in charge of naeseong and found out about the mission
what then does she know about massacre
when he met sir kim she came to see sir kim
and he heard that she asked it to sir kim
she came to save she came to save jang
it's me
anything yet
this is pain in my ass
this is obvious that a guy like me did stupid things on rock
are you here for the shift
so you know
i'm little timid
you'd eat tiger with your words
but i'm
i'll do it
really
i knew it and i brought this
here have it
eat it
is jang there
every shift he has to report where the hell is he
it's really important come to jingak temple
no
oh my gosh you
why did you steal the book
where are you sending it to
why did you touch baekjae singi
if you choose the country
leave the evidence that jang is a spy
either giroo brought it and jang touched
or jang brought it and giroo touched
disguise the book
if you choose jang
you can leave the pot and archer that i gave you
or both of you did it together
then instead of jang
i'll die
episode 13
oops here
where am i
i'm going to jingak temple and i'm lost
do you happen to know how to get there
yes
you can go down to that rock
is it thank you
what happened  pardon
i'm talking about her
she didn't come through the secret path
she came right at me
so i think she really was lost
a woman was lost in the mountain at night
she didn't look a commoner by looking at her clothes
there are high class people coming to temple quite often
i met prince aja around here
so we just didn't know but people get lost in this area
you met prince aja here
yes  then
did you know there's a way here
that
i was just wandering around the cottage
i see keep look out
yes
clearly they knew each other
it's not a lie that she went to jingak temple
i should have told him to escape
i couldn't say it in front of him
you really met him
would he come
he saw me he'd come
did you meet him
he got busted by haneuljae people so he won't come
have you met him

alright i'll watch out now you can go
yes
no
doctor is in metallurgy workshop
he wants to know what
go to him  yes
why would she come why
is it true
are you really giving it to me
yes i am

and she said she's here to study the nature
anyway she's interested in other stuff
other stuff
i can't say it
do you want this too
what this wow
can you really give it to me
of course
i saw the priest was saying honorifically to her
priest boryung
is that priest the head here
if we're going to sell stuff here
we need to know him better
she is not the head of this temple
he came here for my lady
she must be really high class accompanying priest
just she's like that
it suits you too well have this too
this too
you don't have to do this
then what do you guys eat
so introduce us that rich lady
it's better for us to sell expensive thing
yes if you do that i'll give you this necklace
what really really
you guys know how to sell
oh jejus
i must find it where must it be
why did she come
jang
show me the alloy you did

is the alloy which is mixed with copper and tin
really
it was very helpful to me
ok follow me
yes
it's here i know let's get focused
it wouldn't be laid off here
right tin 80 breaks copper 20
yes
why did she come
maybe isn't ms mojin in danger
why did she come isn't she in danger
doctor
why  i have a place to go
do you have to go now  yes i won't be long
come back soon  yes
i'm sorry i was in rush
i feel much more sorry it's over now
doctor i'm sorry
ms mojin told me to keep an eye on you
i know i heard it from dad
you told me you like someone
is that woman in jingak temple
she told eunjin and woosoo to watch her out
you shouldn't go now go when they come here
no no don't see her
this is the baekjae singi
massacre haneuljae immediately
yes
what do you want
yes according to my father kim saheung
doctors who were expelled from baekjae smuggled in silla
and maintain their private space
but their skills are too valuable to massacre
and they'll choose to die if we conciliate them
yes i heard that too
i'll go inside themand take all methods out of them
you want to be a spy  yes
if you do it for us it's better for silla
yes when it's done
silla can be the center of diplomacy
right that won't be your request
i should request to you
majesty that's not my request
it's not  yes
i want princess sunhwa
what
if all my missions are accomplished and returned
i want to marry with princess
what this is not baekjae singi
it's the book of jin's technology
stop stop
cancel the order stop the massacre
what's going on
it's a trap trap
i see
this is for you so don't move and stay here
but  no not ever
don't you move
i'll guard outside of door don't think
bumro  i said don't
just sleep
or read books ok
you don't move ever
confucious analects it's not mine
maybe princess
jang is here without moving
i'm here it's jang
why did you steal the book
where are you sending it to
i i didn't
tell me now
i saw it first
confess the truth
i don't know it was there
i really
why did you touch baekjae singi
look at your hands
no i'm the victim here
doctor it's not me
strange stones were found near haneuljae
so i pasted it in fake book when it's used in baekjae singi
i wasn't sure so i made a trap
but both of you have the secret powder on your hands
either giroo brought it and jang touched
or jang brought it and giroo touched
or both of you did it together
tell me the truth
don'tjust stare at it you should grab and look closely
i didn't touch anything
are you inspecting our hands now
yes why inspect our hands
it's all done do your stuff
you two touched this book among all of us
did you steal it
no jang was in cottage and he just read the book
why did you go there
i felt uneasy about not lending him book
and i went there to apologize
then did you steal it
no i read it becuae it was in my cottage
you two didn't steal it but you read it
i was in workshop all day
but you didn't come to metallurgy workshop
where were you
i was at ms mojin's dye workshop
has anyone seen you there
i don't know why
but nobody was there except me
it means no one saw you
where were you all day
until afternoon i was watching the stone
i went to metallurgy workshop for a second
then you had to go somewhere where did you go
i was looking out for all day and i was tired
so i took a rest
has anyone seen you  no one did
then nobody has seen you either
if there's nobody that confirm your alibi
i have to suspect both of you
you two can't escape now
doctor  i have things to ask you
why did you come back
jang was with me
jang never stole the book
then were you resting with him
yes  where
in his cottage
until we got there  yes
but you didn't see giroo
no i didn't see him
that doesn't make sense
pardon
before i and jang went to workshop
i went to my room for a second the book was there
i even checked the book in the draw
then when i came out jang and giroo were there
jang  i took jang
and we went to workshop
yes doctor
and jang had to go somewhere
the book was stolen at that moment
it means the time when you and jang was resting
the book was gone
why doesn't it make sense
like you said jang didn't steal the book
and resting in the cottage and it must be giroo
surely you had to see giroo leaving the book in jang's place
but you said you didn't see giroo
i told you to watch out jang
where is jang
did you steal the book together
no  then
then where is he
anyway jang didn't steal the book
at that time  bumro
he was heading villege under the mountain
are you saying jingak temple
did he meet that woman
no he didn't meet her
you can ask people who went to jingak temple
do you know her
i don't
can you prove what you did
i can't do that
first look out for the secret stone spot and
search jang and giroo's room
didn't jang meet her
no we were there for whole day
but jang didn't come
what happened to that book
have you got anything yet
she is very royal
even priest was accompanying with her
and shs has bodyguard too  do you know
her name or a daughter of who
her maid takes everything
she won't tell the crucial things
but there was a large workshop
workshop
we were afraid of getting exposed
so we avoid to walk around there
but it was very luxurious workshop
really  silla officers come by often
even priest comes and goes the palace
right she's here to study the nature
hey why are you doing this
have i told you he's not seeing her
that is true though
then what's going on book and secret stone
you don't need to know  we heard everything
then you know so  still
what's really happening
strange stone was found and book was lost
jang and giroo got in trouble
we know that already
so you really took it
anyway it's not jang
or giroo  yes they shouldn't be
i haven't decided yet
oh gosh
who is it
let's arrange it nicely
firstly jang and she have feeling for each other
it's for sure  definite
ms mojin is suspecting her
the temple she's staying at conveys the study to silla
baekjae singi is the best book of learning nature
and it was in jang's cottage
and jang stole it
i'm sure he didn't he was with me
yes jang didn't steal it and giroo stole it
but giroo doesn't know her
then it'll all go to jang
father what do we do
we just just shut our mouth
it's definite you were there
and young couple were crying and stuff
who is a spy and spy what
right so you have to be quiet
if jang is not because of her
jang was with me so he'll be fine
now we're 'zip up' father and son
zip up  yes
even if i call you you say 'hm' instead of 'yes'
they keep insist no
we have to open their mouths no matter what
have you found anything
there's nothing in jang's cottage
these are from engineer giroo's room
it's important come to jingak temple
jingak temple

i haven't forgotten the disgrace and teaching
and i became the royal liege of silla
i've waited to stand in front of you
i've been doing my mission for 10 years
i'm kim doham
but you
why did you come here
how did the princess of silla come here
perhaps
it's not because of humble jang
it's not because of baekjae people jang
you can't do this
you must not do this
even if you are favored you came here
you shouldn't run to him
you're the princess of great silla
he's the one that i want to make silla with
so please make a decision
is it silla or baekjae
is it me or jang
what are you saying
my final mission was baekjae singin
and it drags me and jang to a spy
then why is it my decision
people will go to jingak temple tomorrow
if you choose the country
leave the evidence that jang is a spy
disguise the book
since you work in naesung you'll know sword and ondol glass
if you choose silla
make the evidence that jang took it from it
if you choose jang
you can leave the pot and archer that i gave you
dr mok would know it's done by me
then instead of jang
i'll die
but there's other way
i can take you both out
no there's no other way
i didn't get baekjae singi yet
for silla and for you
i'll continue my mission for king
so princess you must make a choice
is it me
or is it jang
if you choose jang
jang is in the warehouse at the back
i will not beg you
if it's not you
even i get to live i don't have a goal to live
she wouldn't come because of me
she wouldn't come
she shouldn't come
she shouldn't come
hello
you call her out  you call her
i'll go in and search
how do we call her  well
hello
are you here again  yes
perhaps you're not here to take what you gave me
no i'm not that kind of merchant
then why are you here again
today i brought really special thing
please let me show it to your lady
well i can tell her
lady
what is it
what is it that they wanted to show me so desperately
yes
do you know the woman in the jingak temple
do you know the woman in the jingak temple
i asked you that you know her
yes i do
jang
then do you know this book
no
there are details of sword and ondol
that only we're able to know
and your name is written
and this
this is from the woman's room
what
did you try to steal the baekjae singi for her
no it's impossible
it's true jang was with me
you didn't take your eyes off at him not just one second
yes
even when jang was with doctor in workshop
he was with the doctor
what were you doing
engineer gomo what was bumro doing at that time
he was having dinner with me
that's correct but it was just a second
a second is enough to steal the book
but it wasn't me
then why did you come out of her room
that's what i wanted to ask
i knew i shouldn't but i loved her in my heart
but how how did she
have this
it must not be her writing
it's not her writing
yes you can check it it maybe not
it can be conspiracy to me and jang
how can you check it
honestly
the letter she left in jang's cottage it's with me
what
then that letter
bring it  yes
i knew he was seeing a silla woman long time ago
i don't want him to see her
i wanted him to stay in haneuljae
that day i went there to convince him with the letter
if the letter and writing is different it's entrapping
someone was framing jang
it's the same the letter and book has the same writing
what happened to yeon gamo
she used to live in achak but she's dead
and she has a son
what son
then what happened to him
what the hell did you really do this
no it wasn't me someone trapped me
i'm not the one
didn't she trap you
that's not possible she wouldn't have done it
bumro untie me
i gotta go out she might be in danger
i gotta go i must go
he got baekjae singi instead of princess sunhwa
how things got undone like this
can't you believe it now what's taking it so long
shouldn't we empty this place and look what is happening
go and tell women to pack things up quietly
secretly don't let anyone know we're moving
yes
tell men to gather

we'll pick the wick one by one
whoever pulls out he wick with ink
has to complete the job

i set it up everything to get you out of there
the book i was delivering

so i planned it
what in the world you princess
you wouldn't come even if i ask you to
there was only this way
now you can't go back come with me
damn why you
why are you trying to control my life
does love mean some sort

are you listening jang this must not happen
no matter how she favors you it mustn't happen
you can let princess go now
and i'll you let you go too
it's princess the princess of silla
it's impossible to run away from here
again you shouldn't do that to princess
i must let her go before soldiers come
i must let her go
so without any problem
she can go back to her place
we're soldiers sent by kim doham
are they here
princess please forgive me
it looks like it search it now
search find her
search it  yes sir
she can't run faster than us
find her now
yes sir
find her now
how did it go
it looks like she made it out of here
what
goosan deliver this to my father
and dispatch all my soldiers to all over silla
understood  yes sir
i'll make any excuse to head to seorabul
be cautious not to spread any rumors
i got it
that's you too
you know what happens to princess if it's exposed
make them shut their mouths
yes
princess princess
where are you soldiers are really gone
where are you soldiers are really gone
chogi
princess  did soldiers really go
yes
the hwarang who used to come to the temple
he somehow knew and brought soldiers with
is that so  yes i wonder how he knew
maybe he was stopping by let's go
can we really do this
i'm just following you because you threated me to die
just wait for me
pardon  it's just
she's not ready yet
then
if she lives as a commoner for a few days
she'll change her mind
so please be patient
yes i'll do that then will you go back
yes she will go back
and she must go back
it's so messy here and where have you been
i went to look for jang
did you send him away
i don't believe that he is a spy
you always worried about security and safety of this place
i don't understand your attitude
even if you favored him you should've revealed things
and punish what you must punish
it's all the woman in the temple did it
it happened because of their love
i can't understand it i can't
i can't understand either
in my life
do you know what i regret the most
when yeon gamo found me in achak
i didn't recognize her pain
clearly she
she wanted to run away with me
i should have gone with her
yes you should have left with her
you stayed behind and you're afflicting me
you should have left
did princess make all this
damn how could this
but if king founds out princess might be in danger
so duke asked me to keep quiet about this
i got it
plus he wanted to dispatch private men
of course i must do that
i have to see the king because of the war with baekjae
you go and get ready the soldiers for me
yes
i was waiting for you
yes is there something i can do
you would know my second princess dukman went
to goguryu as a messenger
yes i know that
but goguryu's attitude isn't like the same as last time
what do you mean by that
they didn't treat the princess like previous time
she got the feeling that a messenger was sent to baekjae
to baekjae
general wisong is going to attack the baekjae castle soon
if goguryu breaks the ally and attack us
this is the huge trouble
yes of course
so let kim doham know this and find out about it
blank
so there's a chance that information may leak
yes sir
since princess sunhwa is there
if she know the situation deliver the message through her
yes sir
get out the way
get out the way
move
move
blank
beg it is to win the war against silla
please send me i can win this war
i surely want to win and i'll win this
but through the diplomat
blank
we'll easily outscore silla
goguryu has been our enemy more than silla
do you think i don't know that
after the era of king jinheung in order to recover our land
we must borrow goguryu's power
that's right and silla is constantly
preparing a war through hwarang
this sounds asking for help
but in fact it's begging
my opinion is to reduce bloodshed of people and to win
why do you always disagree with me
why are you always so negative having a war
what  that's enough
anyhow unresponded goguryu sent a messenger
and it's the best way if we can do it by diplomacy
firstly go for diplomacy
yes sir
our request is only one
at the moment we're attacking silla
just move goguryu force to the border of silla
you don't even need to attack
just move your units to make silla to
divide in half
then what can you provide me
we changed the sword which only could stab
and we made it to stab and cut
as you know military strength will extremely increase
i know you're having trouble with endless attack from soo
blade will do great damage on the war with soo
that's not enough
not enough
give us the myunggwanggae
are you talking about the armor
yes at the last battle with soo
we had huge impact from the armor units
what did it do
myunggwanggae
our soldiers could hardly open their eyes from its golden color
and it doesn't easily get rusted
plus pest don't come close so you don't get sick easily
but we haven't even seen that
why are you asking us to make that one
you shouldn't avoid like that
according to soo its materials
were brought in from baekjae definitely
but if you step back like this
are you trying to have diplomacy with two countries
if you agree to make the armor we will accept your request
if not we can't accept that
i hope they didn't intentionally do that to ruin diplomacy
if so why would they come here
now the war with soo is
goguryu's national crisis
but we've never gave them the armor
i know
there isn't about the armor in baekjae singi of dr mok
send a message to taehaksa and order them to make one
yes
whatever prince aja orders
you have to concentrate making the armor
just pretend
now soldiers of silla are
about to attack us
and what's the diplomacy worth now
i'll take all responsibilities
you just make the armor
yes
father this is our chance to get the flag
i do think so
yes goguryu requested unreasonable favor
they don't want to accept our request
sir general should order to aristocrats
to dispatch their private men and secure provision
yes
i will command the first platoon
what happened
no one in the taehaksa
wants to invent myunggwanggae
yes it looks like it
go back again
to haneuljae sir
give the baekjae singi and the list of goods sent to soo
and tell dr mok about my difficult situation
yes sir
all of you know how important this is for prince aja
i know we don't have time but please make it fast
it is very shinny when sun reflects it and don't get rusted
and pest don't come close so it won't have any sickness
and that was imported from baekjae
this is the list of goods sent to soo
i see we'll gather our hands to complete it
silla is coming in soon we're running out of time
how did you come by yourself
yes i understand the information of goguryu
but i need to know what happened to princess
i couldn't sit around and wait
what really happened
i have wrote detail information of goguryu in this letter
i'll make up an excuse
and head to seorabul
father you must find princess no matter what
it is what i should do
but what happened
perhaps did he kidnap her
that's not it
what it's not
then did she do it by herself
how could she be so irresponsible
dispatch a man around lady maya's place and palace
she might send someone there
you must find her must must
this is the closest you can get to baekjae from silla
if we get chased from here
i'll follow you to baekjae
so don't ever think about leaving me
this isn't real
how can i manage the tax without my children
i know  we'll be killed
it's better to die if we get whipped everyday
carry her now  right
why do you care about them
we don't know what would happen to us
what in the world
what are you trying to do
i have to find out how it happened
you're not in the position to do something for them
but if i sell my jewels
what about us how are we gonna live
we need those jewels to buy id card
they aren'tjust watching because they don't have mercy
they don't help us because it's like their situation
it fears them that it will happen to them some day
that's why they get their things
old man look here
that is people
now you have to live like that
all people have to pay the tax from cotton and crops annually
in order to do that either you buy loom to weave cottons
or do something else to buy the cotton
and we have to make our own field
we don't have our own field or can do any cultivation
so we gotta cultivate flowers
this is the beginning of living as a commoner
if you can't do that you have to get whipped
like grandma you saw in the afternoon
you chose this way
if you can't handle this you can't live with me
i will do it
i am doing this
i'll dig up the land you pick one
make the field we have to sow seed
i'll dig up the land you pick one
you do that i won't move a bit
i'll work too
that's enough please go in
i can do this
i have to do something so please go in first
what is this
what we can get is just bamboo
i have to make a fan or mat to sell it
look closely i have to catch an animal for tonight
you have to do all this
put the strongest bamboo up here
then like this
like this
you can do it this way
how's it is it good enough
nobody would buy this if you make it like this
knot is left out everywhere make it again
untie it all and do it again
it's all done
knot is left out here
nobody would buy it if blood is stained in basket
so you'd better go
even if i live with you this isn't it
i can't treat you like this
you need to wake up
why are you doing this to me
it's all done i made it
it's good
really am i qualified to sell it
you have to make 20 of those
it'll get us seed for crops
i'll go and check if animal got into a trap
i'm worried if i can't send you back
why are you doing this
i'm going to sell fur and head back to home
you sell it here
yes i got it
since you've been to market a lot
there are ruffians who ask for street tax
you have to be careful
i understand but you have to pay tax
what are you doing here
what are you doing
look here  what
i don't have money this is all i can give you
so please allow me to sell baskets here
please please
well next time you have to pay more
of course of course
thank you thank you
grandma can i sell here
yes you can
that how much is a basket  pardon

i earned it for the first time my first time
grandma i just sold this

i have to see whether i can buy farming tool
why you couldn't sell
it's not that
then what's wrong
that
the grandma who was whipped can't pay up tomorrow
she'll be whipped again
so you gave all away
yes but
are you going to give all of our stuff everytime
there are tons and thousand people like that
are you gonna do the same thing to them
i'm going to
so please go back
you don't belong here so go back
young woman woman
young woman
how did she know this house
i'm sorry
she asked me thousand times
i'm sorry to visit you at this time
what brought you here
fortunately a dozen of people could add bits and bits
so i can pay it tomorrow
really
yes
i appreciated it too much
i have nothing to give
thank you thank you so much
now i'm a real commoner
i'm not a princess i'm a commonerjust like you

but i'm not sunhwa of yesterday i must live differently
so don't hurt my feeling and leave now

why there
perhaps if we get caught you'll need cross the border
and i'll follow you
this is the place
it's very gorgeous
i'll make a house for only you here
you will wait for it
of course of course
still
i did every alloys i could but there's no metal like that
haven't giroo and gomo come yet
no
if i can't do this prince will be in trouble
maybe it's not a metal after all
didn't you compound every metals that
baekjae sent to soo
that's correct
if it doesn't work you should think upside down
take a rest and think differently
differently
different
what silla soldiers are moving to castle chunwie

prince aja doesn't know this
don't waste our time doing diplomacy and attack fisn't
that is absolutely right

at first i'll command first platoon
second platoon must construct a position at castle dosal
and be ready for my fire signal

the prince who doesn't know the battle
before you go leave a man
where yeon gamo used to live
her son may turn up there

our purpose is

yes sir
you fool what happened what happened
what happened
i lost him
we chased him down to land of baekjae but we were dected
then did he make it
is he alive
he got into baekjae's ambush but he's one of
princess he made it we got to go now
you must keep it silent  yes
if it's found out i don't know what will come
i got it
we're late let's go  yes
princess what was your intention doing this
i want to talk to her privately
yes sir
no one could have done this except you
you're wild broadminded and passionate
it could've happened once in your life
when i was a member of hwarang
our teacher priest asked me once
who would be the worst commander
to lead soldiers
not knowing love feeling pasion
the commander who only knows principle of rights
and not knowing the behavior of people with emotion
that commander wouldn't know the feeling of soldiers
and all types of action towards soldiers
he only can lead soldiers with rules
that he can't lead them with his heart
on the same hand
that's why you can be a great leader of silla
because you've experience and done everything
so you have to stop it here once is enough in your life
from the beginning until now
this is your place
and the person beside you must be me
it's not jang
what happened to that man
he acrossed to baekjae
acrossed to baekjae
now i can relax things won't go big
fortunately king and lieges were focusing on war
they were careless to princess
yes this shouldn't be revealed
of course it shouldn't
he was very furious about the seodongyo incident
if he finds out he ran away with him
he will deprive her position
plus two princesses will separate princess sunhwa
from the affair she's doing now
of course they will
and  yes what
please look after princess to determine her mind
it's good that mother makes a visit to princess
yes yes i got it
i heard you
look at this
how did you do it
it's the alloy mixed tin and copper with 22 to 78 ratio
i heard it can be easily broken when it's thrown
so i knocked it few times
then  then it didn't break
color was gold and most of all leech was dead
what leech died
so i put some beans and it didn't get rotten easily
perhaps is this an alloy
then you don't get sick easily
it is
doctor
i did it already
it's all similar except it's not so shinny on sun
and after all it's too heavy
it's not suitable for armor
what do we do we don't know its material
so we can't make it on time
then prince would
how did it go  you're here
already  we're terribly sorry
but we didn't get anything yet
prince is waiting a day like a year
i came early this time
is there something going on
general bu yeosun left to castle chunwie already
pardon
then
the war will be started
prince aja is taking 2nd platoon and go to war
honestly i heard dr mok and ms mojin talking
so
jang and the woman
the woman
the woman the woman in the temple
yes  so
they left together
what they escaped at night together
escape at night
really giroo didn't release them
shh too loud say quietly
is that true
yes they even rode a flower carriage
what flower carriage
jang hit the jackpot real jackpot
when i heard this my heart was pumping
why is your heart pumping
if not a flower carriage
if i can snatch a man just like this
you want to try before you get older
who who me
wait has tiles been roasted
i have serious things to
there is no joy no joy in my life
one fool ran away with luxury woman
another one is wandering somewhere
i don't even see him
what's this  open it
but
when jang was young he tried to give it to women
then
i think it's reason why women like him
so  what do you mean so
what i'm saying is to pay attention to me
damn my life damn my life
somebody has escaped with a lover and a lovely house
spending wonderful life
i get this nor black or red
i received this unexplainable thing
am i that bad
where are you giroo where are you jang
damn my life
i'm baekjae people baekjae

how's the situation outside
according to message silla army is in mount goosung
and obstruct their position
that's located up in canyon
mount gosung
the canyon is extremely deep
you should concentrate on sustaining castle jinji
no no sustaining castl can't be enough merit
then
we ambush in canyon and attack when silla comes down
and we will go up to jinji
but you don't have experience in mount goosung
most of battles were the first place i have been
plus i've never lost in ambusing of the canyon
yes you're right sir
it's 5 o'clcok  which commander should i send
i'll command it the battle without the head
how can you expect victory

i alarmed it since last night but fire signal is not on
what happened to message sent to 2nd platoon
i've sent through secret path
but i can't be certain it made through
a messenger horse is back
they don't have enough provisions in the castle
how about we attack now
we have quite loss as well
experienced general does not venture constraint attack
rest soldiers and mend our weapons
and we give our best in chance
if backup force comes
make solid surrounding around the castle
don't let them send any help or go near the fire signal
understood  yes
sout esat west gates are all surrounded
we won't be able to ustain the next attack
what happened to sented message
is fire signal our last option
yes sir
send a soldier to fire signal
but they are defending it too well
no matter how you do it
tell them to go to steeple
send a soldier now
yes sir
i can't die like this
i can't die like this
have weapon workshop agents are sent to battle field

i went to check his character
didn't you go to the temple to see him
it is very fortunate
princess looks quite satisfied
i'm very glad that you praised my son
you became a officer in young age and success is guaranteed
the reason he chose dangerous job was because of you
he'll come back from the mission i must hurry your marriage
kim doham can seize your eager temper
finally king mentioned about marriage
marriage  yes
your father told me to finish up the job and come back quickly
princess how is princess doing
she doesn't move a step from her room
i see off you go  yes
are you alive are you alive
it seems so quiet have we won
then aren't our hopes gone
send it through waterway
we failed
we don't have a way
we can't make it through tonight
sir you must get out of the castle
what is it
i'm going to use prisoners to use them in battlefield
well aren't in charge do that
yes but what do i do with death rows
and a man from silla
aren't they going to die anyway we can block the arrows
yes  a man from silla
might open the gate for them so kill him
yes i will
wait
how many are there  it's five
bring them to execution place
we have lack of soldiers
proceed execution
yes

you sent me to live in the land of baekjae
and i get to die in the land of baekjae

you're already dead
do you want to live  yes
there's a way
just say anything we'll do anything
put fire on signal steeple
whoever puts fire on the steeple i will exonerate your crime
and reward 1000 gold will you do it

i don't want no arrows in my body
i lived dirty and i got to die clean

no choice execute them  yes
will you give it a try
we'll die anyway let's give it a try
brother just die clean
let's do it
i'll do it i can try it
when strategy is ran out just put yourself into a corner
rats can bite cats
it's gold gold gold
if you put fire on it's all yours
it's the proof of exoneration in the name of officer
really are these ours
secret path is exposed and waterway is failed
last one is to bring down the rope outside of castle
and if we get to escape using dark it's fortunate
if not the man will be killed without stepping the grond
there's other  where is the shortcut
shortcut
a shortcut to fire steeple
you have to go through the main gate
open the main gate please
main gate  yes
now i'm thinking if we can't make it back here
what does 1000 gold worth
they used that
let's live all we need to do is come back alive
let's do that in this dirty world being alive is the revenge
let's do that
let's try it it can't be worse than dying
i'll live i'll live
i will live
is that 1000 gold fire steeple
it's too early to smile
i and you two will lure out silla soldiers

who the hell is it
brother are you ok
i'll live

crown prince crown prince
the fire of castle chunwie is on  the castle
yes it means castle is surrounded
we now make a sally to castle chunwie
yes
we were underwent to only 5 people
if we meet baekjae backup before we plunder the castle
we might get wiped out
i can't retreat like this now we attack in full force
gerenal that's
we must plunder the castle before 2nd platoon comes
yes
silla soldiers are moving they look like they'll attack us
damn
all we need to do is maintain until backup comes

the rumor that backup is nearly here
so bolter is increasing

i got bewildered in many situations around me
i was curious
it's because i didn't have power i got to have power
even small things i want to i got to have power
if you got to have power you must have a master
i'll give you the power

you're not the one

episode 16
defend the fortress with all your might
we're outnumbered sir
i can't die like this
i can't die like this
light the beacon
whoever lights the beacon
will be freed and rewarded
i will live i will live
i will survive

to see you again
i will not die
to throw away this guilt that i couldn't save you
i will live i will live to pay my debts
we must retreat there are rumors that
baekjae's reinforcements are near and more men are dropping out

the shilla troops are retreating the shilla troops are retreating
you have done well
this man is bu yeosun
these people have saved us move them the dead too into the fortress
yes
you willl be rewarded soon take a breath for now
is this is this true is this really ours
are we alive for real
i guess so i guess we really are alive
yes we are we are alive
yes we are alive we are
we're alive just like this
alive
this all this is ours
this all this is mine mine
how can this be how can this be
with this i can buy my own land
and work until i have blisters on my hands
with this i can buy my wife clothes
i was never able to afford
i can dress her in silk
and my wife  what's the matter
what's it with you
no wife no wife to dress in silk
no wife for me
no wife why
carrying a sickle i went to the bastard who laid his hands on my wife
but she was already dead
it wasn't even her fault but she died
no wife no wife
why live what's the use of a thousand gold
when there's no wife with me
no wife at all
i don't deserve to live a fool like me
why not your wife saved you
never to go through that again being helpless
she saved you and gave you the gold why shouldn't you live
live as you have never lived before
princess i have lived
i have lived to see you again
but i don't want to see you
i don't want to see you as a man who couldn't protect his princess
i will not see you as such a man
never
what is it
one of them just seems so familiar
we will soon carry out an assault on the shilla station
huh but we don't have enough men
in war numbers mean nothing
yes but
because of the prisoners their spirits are high
and the men of shilla have retreated
we should strike first while their station is unsettled
besides isn't aja coming with more men
if i 'm a failed general i cannot face aja's face
then the plan
gather all the men and all the prisoners
yes sir
your courage and chivalry have saved baekjae
though i have promised to reward you with gold
these things are not to be done by gold only
hear
learn the loyalty of those who fought risking their lives though they were prisoners
learn the spirit from the five who fought
against the many men of shilla
then you will become invulnerable like them
you will become the gods of victory
by no means we shall win
shilla retreated from their strong will and the spirit of shilla has fallen
and now they are again willing to attack shilla's station
we will start to fight when their fire attacks begin
and we will lead this war into victory
with these loyal invulnerable men
we will become the heroes of this war
hand them out
what's happening this isn't what they promised
this is crazy  wait a sec
this isn't right we need to talk
yes we barely survived we can't go back there
this is crazy let's get out of here we need to talk
this isn't what you promised
there is no promise to the weak
if you want your promises to be kept be strong have power
we can't go
then you shall die
wouldn't it be better to have another chance to live
you must have a reason to live or else you would've died already
i just love your will to love
it's such a wonderful weapon for me
we are not weapons we are people
just kill us
hold it
put them in prison
yes sir
i'm a hierarchy and you're only a slave birth not even a commoner
if i wanted to i could get rid of you easier than getting rid of an ant
if i tell you to become a warrior you become one
if i tell you to become a craftsman you become one
if i tell you to love me you love me
i am not a man who can do such things
then you die
even if i don't kill you the world will
is it really like this am i as weak as this
losing mother and running away alone
not being able to protect you princess was
after all because of me being so weak
he will finish his duty soon and return we must hurry with your marriage
what is it
someone from naesung brought an important secret
about the armor that kokuryo asked baekjae
why did you not give this to the king
his majesty told me to give it to you
and he wants you to give kim doham orders
princess kimdoham is at naesung now
the secret mission began with you princess
and i wanted my last mission ordered by you
and so i asked the king
the secret ingredient that kokuryo wanted from baekjae
wasn't alloy
what what is it then
it wasn't a new alloy that made the armor
a medicine that was sent from baekjae to su was added
a medicine
that is what you need to find out
the first attack on juneusung failed and became a dull offensive and defensive battle
lf by any chance mok rasoo makes the armor and succeeds with kokuryo
it will mean trouble for shilla
so you should make it and tell us first
and you also become a doctor
you must finish his majesty's secret mission
i will take your orders but why are you treating me this way
did you think that i my heart
would be yours by trading with the king
yes
for what i gave the king was my heart for you
and my loyalty to shilla
so i thought i would be able to earn your heart in return
i still do not think i am wrong
the king would not think i am wrong
i came a long way just to give you this
when i return after i finish all my duties
i hope to see your hand wearing my wedding ring
you you why are you always poking your head
in front of eunjin
so what dad  you little brat
your poor old dad is trying
to spend the rest of his life happily with ms mojin
why do you keep interrupting
your poor son is trying to get a life too
at least you had mom
yes but out of all the girls why eunjin
there's woosu and juriyoung
that's because i'm just like you
you like the mother i like the daughter
you bastard answering back every word i say
whatever whatever
i have to push harder while there's no one better looking than me
why you little
i can't believe he's my son now who did i give birth with
we tried every kind of alloy that we could
perhaps they ordered us to make an armor
that doesn't even exist to refuse the crown prince's request
maybe
an armor that shines the world that doesn't get rusty
and that protects you even from stomachaches
would there be such an armor
i agree
and they're accusing that it was
handed over to su from baekjae
now were there any other metals in surabul
no sir
there's a list of the ingredients that baekjae gave to su right
yes why
i'd like to look it over again
all right
a medicine was added
a medicine a medicine
musk wild ginseng sanghwang
chunmokgeum
chunmokgeum chunmokgeum
what are you doing
oh you're here
what are you doing
painting
thinking that maybe they painted gold
right painting
if you paint on metal it won't rust
painting exterminate insects and vermins
and is also used as medicine  yes
but i can't find what makes the armor shine
do you by any chance know a medicine called chunmokgeum
no i don't think so should i ask doctor
augh will you stop giving me that ugly yellow thing
it's not ugly it's something that only i can give you
i mean it that's the point
i don't want something that is so unique i want things that
everyone thinks it precious things that are expensive
come on  and so bumro
when it comes to how a man looks like i like someone who everyone thinks
is handsome not someone who's handsome in their own particular way
that kind of face do you get me
are you really going to be like this
if you keep acting this way i'm just going to
what's going on
giroo look at him
bumro
what i was only
hey where where did you get this
this from jang's hut
where where is it
this but why
where
here 'i don't know the name of this tree
it's not juchil or heukchil
but i think it can be used like one color is gold'
so i made a jewllery box with my own way of painting for eunjin
giroo giroo
blank
blank
blank
i think we're right painting on metal
but i've never heard of hwangsuchil
that's because they're rare and difficult to extract
which is why they were only used for medicine
bumro where is the hwangshil you extracted
that way over there
jang thank you you have completed it all
this is it  yes this is it
run and give it to the princess
yes  and tell her that my duty
is almost finished too
yes
if the soldiers wear this armor to war
the enemies will be blinded by it
you tell me the most important thing in war
is to mess up the order of the enemy
and this will do the job perfectly
right even my eyes are blinded
really we didn't give it a thought that chungeummok would be used like that
we shouldn't have given them to su  that's what i mean
it's all my fault
i don't know what's growing in our gardens and what their use is
this is such a ridiculous situation
it is a process for baekjae to increase its knowledge
don't be too hard on yourself
anyway the crown prince shall be pleased with giroo
no it couldn't have been done without the help of woosu and bumro
i could not have done it alone
yes and that makes me prouder
anyhow woosu and bumro giroo will receive more points
and of course giroo will become doctor for this
congratulations when will i become doctor
have you thought about it
first thank you
thank you
you have taught a young and hottempered man
a very important lesson
i have never felt so helpless in my life
why my mother had died why i had to run away to live
why i couldn't love any woman
and why i couldn't protect her
why i had to live with all these things dragging me
i had always wondered
but you have taught me today
it was because i had no strength no power
to do even the smallest thing i want
i need power
for a man like you to have power you need a master
i will give you power
serve me
no not you
not you
a man like you who makes people feel helpess and lost
can get weapons but not people
you cannot get people
though you have taught me a great lesson
still i cannot be your weapon
this is why i came to tell you this
kill me
i have no regrets not anymore
this is another thing that i learned in prison
kill me
jang
are you not jang
crown prince
i heard about the beacon and came to reward you
but what's this was it not their will like the soldiers said
it will not be late to wait for aid and then settle the troops
why are you trying to carry out such a reckless plan
i am trying to use the opportunity of the frustrating moment of retreat
and it has been a successful plan several times
breaking your promises to the ones who saved your lives
and telling lies to your own men is what you call a successful plan
then should i ask if they are willing to die at war
should i persuade them to fight hard though they can get killed
then are you saying that the soldiers believe in a lying threatening general
i'm not saying that the soldiers believe in a lying threatening general
they do not believe in a failed general
then why was the fortress besieged
if these prisoners did not light the beacon
you would have been surrendered
yes as i listen to your words
it seems that i have learned war in the wrong way
i shall learn from you crown prince
you be our general in this war
i wiil be your adjutant
but that one you know
who
the prisoner that aja recognized
i just remembered when aja was returning to the palace
he was the one who laid the ondol for the king
really
he did  yes
find out who he is
yes sir
what has happened why are you here as a prisoner
has something gone wrong at haneuljae
no haneuljae is fine i just left
but why
what happened
i'm asking you what happened
forgive me but i cannot tell you
you what tell me this instant
i said tell me
my lord forgive me
fine then let me ask you one thing
did you betray haneuljae
no sir
then i will ask no more
but be with me
your clever plans have saved me
i had wanted to keep you by me but i respected you then
but now that we are in war
and after hearing about the beacon
i think we were to meet stay with me
you yourself is already a big comfort to the soldiers
help me
i really want to lead this war to victory
so you must help me
i have no such power
allow me to leave
what
the turtle prophecy that's his the prisoner
yes that's what i've heard
the weakwilled and incapable prince
can barely live because of such men
mokrasu was one of them and so was wanggu
i should've just killed him
i made another man for the crown prince
i'm a soldier too give me some treatment too
i need medical treatment too
why isn't anyone taking care of this soldier
he's not hurt he has had a boil ever since
it's just gotten at its worst
who cares if i already had it or not shouldn't you be treating the sick
there are soldiers everywhere that need treatment right away
because they have been wounded by arrows or spears
you're just lying here everyday not fighting in war
i don't have time for you
what are you talking about
i'm not here because i want to
i'm not fighting because i can't doctor
let me see
hoestly it's killing me
it's not like i want to be sick or anything
my lord crown prince
my lord  my lord
my lord
at a time like this how can a prince
be doing such things
why did the heavens choose aja
who can't fight who can't rule
to be crown prince why not me
if things would work out between kokuryo even now
no news have been heard from haneuljae yet
how many men do we have
we lost a lot of men from the first battle we have only about a thousand left
how about shilla  at least twice as many
and the weapons  we used all the arrows
in defending the fortress
we're bringing in bamboos from nearby
and making them into arrows as fast as possible
what is it
though you are the general
all the army officials are the adjutant's men
they are not eager to carry even the bamboo
my lord  what is it
the people from haneuljae have come  really let's go
doctor mokrasu have sent you  yes
really where is the myoungkwangae armor
this is the armor
good good
now we can negotiate with kokuryo
baekmu get ready and contact the kokuryo envoy
yes
tell mokrasu that i will greatly reward him
yes
but what has happened to jang
huh jang
he is here  what
how did jang end up here
he told me he flew from the shilla soldiers
well it's hard to tell the truth
don't worry tell me
actually he fell in love with a high ranking woman of shilla
what he met a shilla woman is that true
yes
use me sir
you said you'd leave what changed your mind
when i saw you sucking the blood of the sick soldier
and the mother of the soldier cried
saying that her son will probably die if you only ordered
asking what she should do
you crown prince will surely
have many die for you
i will also die for you
but my lord i wish that you would dream what i dream
dream what you dream what dream
unify the three countries
i've heard that you left haneuljae only because of a woman
are you saying that you will serve me only because of that woman
and that you are dreaming such a dream only because of that woman
yes my lord i dream such a dream only because of her
because dreams are born from people
if your parents die of an illness while you're young
you dream of becoming a doctor
if your life changes because of a great teacher you dream of becoming one
so please when you become king dream the unification
of the three countries with me
all right i will formerly appoint you as my commander
i will do it
i will take the armor and talk with kokuryo
do you meant it
yes my lord i will do it
planning diplomatic matters with the armor was something i started
i will also finish it
trust me i am not a little princess anymore
all right
you're not going are you mad fool you must be crazy
after all you've been through and you're not going
and all this time i thought you were my friend
so you have found your master
yes so please think of our friendship and help me
what now
we are a comfort to the soldiers anyhow
just go around and tell them how we lived
and hoe the crown prince kept his promises
that's all you have to do
just talk to them
that's it
yes
so we don't have to go fighting anymore right
yes
you really drive me crazy do you know that
please just this once
so we were on our horses riding by
and the men of shilla started barking as if they were dogs
blank
anyway the adjutant was going to break his promise with us
but the crown prince said that promises to prisoners are still promises
and let us go tears blinded my eyes
and snivel ran like a river
right and the prince even sucked the blood of a soldier's boil
yes
how is it all going
as expected the soldiers' trust and loyalty to you have risen
but we have very few men compared to shilla
and our weapons are poor
the arrows are only a few due to our first battle
it's in a bad state
did you not bring some more
it's because of buyeosun
buyeosun's duty was to protect this fortress
and he did all his duty
so he doesn't need to fight for me he won't
all the nearby powerful families are on buyeosun's side
i sent a messenger to the palace
but even tehaksa seems to be in buyeosun's hands
this is why i must win
the reason why they made me general in the first place
was to make me responsible for any kind of defeat
if that happens i will lose even the smallest power
that you have earned for me with your clever plans
we have to win
so what are their plans
according to the officials forget the plans
they don't even seem to know what's going on
no doubt didn't the crown prince always
go for diplomacy to japan and su he avoided war
he seems to be at a loss
we're short in everything
true and we lost our chance to attack first
if he was a warrior who knew how to fight
he would have attacked at that time
if i were him i will not attack now
did you not go  we did go but
all the houses around here already had sons in the army
they were all crying and we just couldn't pass by
and they called us beacon heroes and asked us for help
he was never called a hero in his life so when he heard the word
he just had to go inside
but how is the situation
everything is in poor condition
even buyeosun who is on our side will not cooperate
he's really awful look at what he did to us
i mean really if it wasn't for the prince
we wouldn't even be alive you know
don't you agree captain
i thought you said you hated all high ranking people
yes but
hey but what kind of captain are you
what are you talking about
everyone calls you captain so i did too
but what kind of captain are you
i'm a sea captain you idiot
anyway do you what the situation of our enemy is like
not really
to fight without knowing about our enemy this can't be done
baekmu how did things go with kokuryo
what's wrong things didn't work out even with the armor
with due respect i am sorry to say that we were a step too late
late
it seems that kokuryo asked the same thing to shilla
and  shilla seems to have made the
armor before us
crown prince
i will enter the enemies' station
what
i have heard that it is important to know the situation of the enemy
as it is important to know ours
so i will go and see how many men and weapons they have
and how their food and water are supplied
of course it's important but that is too dangerous
it's all right just get me a shilla soldier's uniform
i will look for the weapons captain look for the food and water supplies
and you check the number of men
what
i'm sorry  hey
yes
you look like you have energy leftover roaming around not in bed
let's go check the weapons
the weapons  yes
some weapons are to come during the night and we need some men let's go
yes  follow me
plenty good
carry them
hey what are you doing  huh
we don't have time
hey  yes
you take this tea to the general
uh which general
you idiot general wesong of course
uh i'm not sure
stupid kid still a newcomer that tent over there
yes
the situation is in our favour
his majesty told me to succeed in taking the farmlands here
he told me to send more weapons here
your tea general
go tell the adjutant to come
yes
you come here
what
who are you
hey you stop there stop
so how was it
there seems to be about 2000 men
and their food and weapon supplies kept coming in
though they didn't seem to really need it
they especially had a lot of arrows
which means that there are many welltrained old soldiers
defending the fortress won't be a problem but attacking first
will be a war decided by the old soldiers
the chances are against us
it will be better not to fight
if i return like this to the palace i will be in the same position as before
even if it takes a long time i'm going to wait for the weapons to arrive
i will win this war
and you
i will fight
are you planning to shoot straws instead of arrows
it's an impossible situation for an unexperienced commander give up
no i will see the end of this whether i win or lose
i see
i have heard the news
yes your majesty i finished my task without any difficulty
yes i knew you would do well
though i was worried for you are still young
but because of that i heard you
scolded the envoy of kokuryo trying to break the alliance
and i was very proud
thank you my gracious lord
you have courage that not even princess chunmyung or princess dukman has
now winning the war is the only thing left winning the war
yes
sir
what is it  the prince crown's army
used the fog and the straw sheaves
and collected all the arrows of shilla
what how
the ravine where we were attacked
it's always covered in fog
they pretended to attack and because of the fog arrows were used
but there were only straw sheaves there
yes
now shilla has lost its arrows and baekjae got them
the attack has already begun
i have lost
crown prince you have done very well
your majesty i have won in war
i have taken the land all the way to shilla fortress
you have been clever
i received the message that your weapons were burnt
and so i was worried
how did you manage to win before the weapons were sent from the palace
there was a loyal friend who helped me
who
this is he
you
yes your majesty this is he who laid the ondol
when you were sick
and he helped you in war
yes he deserves the most credit for the victory of this war
he is also the one who lit the beacon during the first battle
he is the one who saved the fortress
is that so
it was his plan to win this war
though we had no weapons
how was that possible
the place we fought is a ravine always covered in fog
in the first battle that was where we were attacked
but he used the fog and straw sheaves
carried out a remarkable plan and brought victory
lift your head
you have been a great help in this war
what is your name
i am called jang
jang
i will greatly reward you tell me what you would like
i will give you anything just tell me
i am really a man who studies the principles of nature
there is someone who has taught me all this
i would like to be near him
who is he
he is doctor mokrasu who was the head of tehaksa
please bring doctor mokrasu and the people of haneuljae
from shilla to beakjae's tehaksa
please bring back the doctor and the people of haneuljae
bask to this palace
bring the people of haneuljae here
how do you know the doctor
i am his disciple and a member of haneuljae
after the doctor was wrongly accused and sent to shilla
he did not go to shilla and still remains faithful to you my lord
and so i respect him and i believe
that a man like him should be near you and baekjae for the country's sake
but your majesty mokrasu was accused of conspiracy
that old bronze censer story
yes crown prince do you need it to be repeated
a birth mistaken burns incense alone
he who burns it alone becomes king
the king will rebuild baekjae and receive all the glory
how dare anyone say such things about the king's position
how dare anyone make a bronze censer
with such a writing
you're right your majesty this is a conspiracy
it is if the doctor had really made it
but did he
it was found in his room
we don't know if the doctor made it or someone put it there
all i'm asking is did we go through all the right procedures
no my lord we just assumed everything
we did not he ran away from guilt
well then let's bring him back
though it is not the same request as jang
i believe we should distinguish between right and wrong
so let's bring them back here
please bring them back your majesty
your distribution and will saved baekjae
we start our attack on the fog attack
and i'll lead this war for the victory
i'll give you power obey me
it's not you general
i can't obey the man who gives impotence and loss to people
that kind of man can get weapons
but you can't get man
i don't have any regret at all
kill me
jang
i'll go into enemy's base
they used fog to steal
silla's arrows by rice straw
now silla lost their arrows and baekjae gained them
attack is already started
i lost it
dr mok and haneuljae were abandoned to silla
please return them to the palace
dr mok has false charge and after he was thrown away
he hasn't naturalized to silla and still look towards you lord
so i admire him
i think he must be next to you
that's the way for baekjae
but lord mok rasoo has done treason
are you trying to show us bronze censer again
who can argue pro and con about the position of king
who can make the bronze censer
with that engraved pendant
if he made it it's definite treason
but did he actually make that
but it was found at his workshop
whether he made it or someone put it there
did you actually follow the procedure when asking
so let's bring him in
i think it's right time to find out what really happened
so bring him in
please bring him in lord
let's think about that
episode 17
jang how could you say that without any discussion
baekmoo go and tell wanggoo to send
few bodyguard to haneuljae
yeah but lord hasn't ordered yet
jang can guide him  yes
it's more important to bring him in than interview
now is the time
yes sir
go now
didn't we get busted
we can't say no when they are bringing him for interview
no no he must not be brought in anyhow
but for what reasons
there are importance of reason and justice
and there are not
we have to stop this no matter what
yes taehaksa is the direct department of the king
the outside looks like education or engineering department
but people who are from there
they become king's people
that's why we tried to hold the taehaksa
if dr mok comes back now
it must be happened
we must interrupt it gather aristocrats
and use anything we can to stop them
what is it  sir dalsol
the bodyguard of wanggoo just left to haneuljae
what  stop it now
use military activity to stop it
blank
we must show our strength our strength
what are you hesitating
yet lord hasn't ordered us
yes
where are you going
it's the order from king
why are you stopping the military of government
perhaps are you bringing mok rasoo from haneuljae
if so king hasn't ordered it yet
i don't care i will obey prince's order
then i can't help you stop them
lord i just sent jang and bodyguards to silla
so all you need to do is to order
it should not be rushed
you don't know their head
i know but if we don't do this
my lord this is wanggoo i may go in
what is it
imperial guards are blocking military soldiers
what
they seem they wouldn't care to act military activity
it may spread to your safety sir i had to stop them
i'm very sorry
what happened  they stepped back
i'll make you feel how much you are powerless
i'm losing your opportunity which was gained so hard
have you lostjust a chance
what are you saying
if you lost another chance you can get it back
i hope you didn't lose the confidence you gained from battle
i was talking about it
work is just work it's not human
situation is just situation it's not human
but why do i lose myself if things don't work out
the situation just got worse why would i lose my confidence
yes
don't do that it's just a beginning
i'll do my best
doctor can come this if not this time maybe next time
if not again then next time
and if he can't come
i'll get you a man just like him
if not i'll be like him
it may sounds like a joke but please believe in my joke
alright i'll believe it whether you be like him
or bring someone like him or bring him
you can do anything let's believe it believe it
when would it be good for giroo's doctor designation
i have received a good date
last day of month will be good
then that will be your designation
yes
i'm really looking forward the day
of course you do
it's the last day of month
really i'm so proud of you
thanks for treating me warm and help me
well i got more help from you
take it
i made this brush to congratulate you becoming a doctor
let this go let go
what do i do  you just mind your business
what part of me you don't like
what am i really that bad
what's the difference between him and me
you don't even come close do i actually have to say it
do it do it
firstly giroo is handsome and you look funny
alright i admit it 10
he looks confident you look miserable
ok i see i admit it 20
and he's good looking you look delicious
just like yam
yeah that's not too bad of me
i can't admit that 21
this is total nonsense
at last you look like a human but giroo looks like a sculpture
that means i'm little better that's 22
so please pay attention to me
i don't know i don't know  hey wait for me
this is nice it's been so long we had party
you have enough alcohol  yes
anyway giroo is not around
it's notjust giroo dr giroo  he's a doctor now
there he comes
dr giroo is there something you'd like to eat
anything would be great and don't use honorific form please
don't use it
that shouldn't happen or it can't happen
right predoctor
i know all of people' drinking behavior
i don't know one particular person who all know who is it
yes who wouldn't refuse celebration toast
anyway we have enough alcohol for days
i know no worries
let's go let's prepare party
now we'll see the end
doctor this is giroo
come inside
i have something to ask
what is it
why are you so hesitate to ask
i don't know about life in taehaksa
people in haneuljae are abandoned from taehaksa
i heard it was because of imperial internal conflict
it's been 10 years already
and there is no promise about the time
are you disappointed that you're a doctor of haneuljae
no i'm not
why do you devote where you were abandoned
it's notjust devotion from imperial
it's for people of baekjae and creation
even if you can't return for all
well i think i can't get out of
where i put my heart in
so that's why i don't even feel like i'm not there
doctor and my master unnoticably i admire you
so i don't want to leave as a spy
general wiesong
you were plundered the land
the region is the fruitful area of silla
plus don't you know it's the best fortress
i'll do another war i'll get it back
i'll get it back for sure
it is ashamed give up crops in harveting season
and the best fortress
but we lost many soldiers already
how can you go another war
i'll prepare quickly and lead to our victory
go for another war
we lost very valuable lands
but another war
there's another way but the war
another way but the war
yes already our soldiers lost their spirits
and we don't have any guarantee for victory
so what's the another way
didn't you prepare to keep it secret for this
the incident 20 years ago
yes we can give them
still they don't know the truth and offer crops annually
we can get our land back for that
yes yes for this i prepared it
i didn't make it huge 20 years ago i kept it secret
yes
right there it was
i had it
prince prince we have a problem
prince we had a problem
all storages in the palace are empty
what happened
aristocrats gathered their strength
aristocrat sa didn't send their woven fabric
because production was low
next it was yeon who cut off their goods
now baek doesn't send argilite
and other region's jewels and minerals
according to gulchi we can't make
luxurious inkstone for soo
because of lack fo argilite
time is running out what should we do
they are telling me to surrender
prince silla messenger is arrived
without any message
i'm not so sure but he wants to see you immediately
i see
what is that true
yes
oh my gosh how can this be
so please make your decision and let us know
i'm going to the lord you gather statesmen
yes
finally he'd pretend mok rasoo thing is gone
i understand aristocrats were rejecting it hard
lord we have gathered what is going on
it is important
what could it be
and it is tragedy
please speak to us lord what could it be
do you remember this
that it's the golden band that king sunghwang used to wear
the keepsafe of our father where did you get it sir
silla messenger came today
and
20 years ago
the head bu yeosun brought
was fake
pardon
we didn't know it was fake
and we held ritual ceremony for 20 years
and for the proof of its genuine
they brought this golden band from real head
they want to exchange it with the land aja plundered
it can't be true it's their strategy
i honestly took king's head
from the square of northen office
at that time were they a lot of soldiers
was security very stricted
it wasn't
were they soldiers anyway
how could you not tell me about that
think about it carefully
if it was real one
they wouldn't leave it as so loose
therefore silla thought we'd recognize it as fake
and never even thought that we could offer crops for it
but we did and they were laughing at it
what do we do about this
this is disloyal and disgrace
no lord the people who were guarding
were definitely soldiers
silla is trying to insult us
it must be the genuine head
don't get tricked over their strategy it's all lie
lord lord
lord i boo yeosun am returning king's head
as my nephew vice general boo yeosun
you have achieved a great mission
from today i can clear my unfiliation in 26 years
silent 26 years will turn to arise of baekjae
and prepare well on today's ritual ceremony
we shouldn't fall into silla's trap
i must have brought the real head
did you dig it yourself
yes because it's king's head i digged it myself
then how come you didn't mention keepsafe was not there
i thought silla must have put it somewhere else
then you should've told me
father
i hope he's telling the truth
but if silla is telling the truth our pride will fall to the ground
we can't put our heads up to king sungwang and people
i can't accept this i'll never accept this
what can you do
i just can't trust it with that golden band
unless we have definite evidence i can't never trust it
finally suspected reason became a problem
security was so poor
their skill was so poor compare to soldiers
and even there was many noise
backup didn't come to help
but i can't admit it
it's not in the office area people walk around the sqaure
it can look weird if units of soldiers are standing there
this is silla's trap
indecisive aja is falling into it
he's notjust falling into it he's stepping on me now
the reason people have the royalty for me
is because of the return of king's head
but if it turns out be a fake
how can i cope with their grievance
it can't be happening it must not happen
so what should we do about this
king and prince will accept their proposal
no no i can't sit around and watch this
pardon it really happened
yes government is in storm now
king is very anxious about this
and so is prince
crown prince this is sun may i come in
come in
what is it
i cannot accept this
we aren't even sure of fake or real
are you telling me to hold ritual ceremony
no it must not be done
if we deny their proposal
they will spread the rumor which we offered crops with fake
find a way
whether it's fake or real
find a way to distinguish it
a way
if you accept it without finding it out properly
i only think it's your intention to slander me
sun  so use taehaksa
or your trustful mok rasoo
find a way
but it's been more 50 years
how can i find a way to check it
then you should keep it quiet
if not i won'tjust watch this
are you threatening me now
i must find the truth the truth
how can you find the truth of skull which has been 50 years
even doctors and engineers of taehaksa
shake their heads for this
what i should do
i know this is total nonsense
what should i do
where is jang i don't see him around
since general came by he was seeking for an answer
and i don't where he might be now
it's good to have him next to me
a skull after 50 years only skull remains
a skull
do people have unique difference in skull do they
right tooth
every individual has different teeth fall out
teeth teeth
what
every individual has different teeth fall out
and it remains teeth remain
how do i know king sungwang's fallen teeth
jang
here you are i was looking for you
what is it
king's ondol isn't like the last time can you go and see it
it takes time to heat up these days
yes ashes are filled in one side
isn't there other problem
yes chamberlain needs to look after it
i will do that
because of this king's health has improved a lot
yes
surely nobody can come close to dr mok
i hope your request is
dr mok can come back here again
yes
but how did dr mok find out about the damp disease
actaully i did
it was you
yes i was studying the grain of tree
i compared king's medica and astronomical journal
and there was relavance
really i see
can i foreign books
which one do you want
according to dr mok the death cause by thunder
or insects and rats all have different cause
i heard those kind of incidents are all in the book
yeah that would be medical book
yes  follow me
this is it go in
thank you
that wouldn't be here
the book wouldn't tell me which
tooth was fell off from king
how long is he taking i haven't seen him for a few days
i know
prince this is jang
come in
where have you been and why do you look so haggard
prince i'm very sorry
i did everything i could but i failed
what about the king's head
yes i found out tooth is strongest evidence of human remains
but i do not know which tooth was fell off him
what fell off
yes
if that
yes right it's all there
i read it i've read it i couldn't think about that
can you really tell just looking at that
can you do it  yes yes
call gulchi from taehaksa
he will have it
yes
lord will you just watch silla
i'll find it out
find out is there a way
there's a way
is it true is there a way
how
come in
tell me how you can do it
this is the king sungwang's tooth
his tooth
what's with tooth
when human body is buried it gets decomposed
within few years and leave only bones
that's correct
but tooth was left in the head
so i can match teeth from king sungwang
how can you match it
the medical journal can
in here chronic disease and new symptoms are
written in precise detail
and there's record of the tooth fallen out
so all i need to do is to match the order of teeth
trace the journal and concentrate on front teeth
i can match the fallen teeth
they couldn't possibly match the order of king's teeth
i ordered to send a message to silla
to meet me at the castle we conquered 3 days later
yes please check it but if silla's telling the lie
i wouldn't wait for another war
i'm the prince of baekjae  i'm the princess of silla
where is the head  it's in next room
tell them to draw in deatil
yes sir
you're told to check it
do you want to see with your eyes
yes i'll check with my own eyes
draw it  yes
it's all done
that voice is
it can't be jang
did you draw it precisly  yes
who who did come as a messenger
why do you need to know
what's the condition of negotiation
as you know return the stolen land and the castle
is that all  yes
alright i'll go back and discuss with statesmen
i'll give you 5 days
ok i'll see you here again
yes
one thing i want to ask you
what's the reason of keeping it separately
even you're the enemy but he used to be the king
it's disgraceful to treat it recklessly
then whose head was the fake one
i heard that was traitor's head
why did you keep it quiet for long
it's a chance to laugh at baekjae imperial
we could get better things than laughing at you
let's go
since you determined yourself you're doing greatjob
can we get this land back
we can
bring the drawing that aja drew
bring the drawing from medical journal
silla was telling the truth
lord please kill me
to clean the disgrace we have sinned
i'll hold memorial service for 100 days from the day of return
alert to people and prepare it
we can take care of it quietly why do memorial service
what's your intention
what can it be more obvious
he wants to take down general's position
but there's no reason to deny
slander was about to be frogotten and another bomb just landed
this is total disgrace
have you decided yet
return the head
then our soldiers will retreat
bring it  yes sir
escort it
he's the king sungwang and my grandfather
allow me to have him the dignity
plesae do so
crown prince
i
i
is something wrong princess
no
shall we go
yes ok
he looked like him
he surely looked like seodong
why hasn't memorial service preapred yet
general stopped it
what sun
please excuse us gentelmen
cancel the 100 days memorial service
and imperial can take care of it quietly
instead return doctor mok rasoo
no question for any crime just like where they belong
this is negotiation
it is compromise
finally we can return haneuljae to baekjae
really is this true
it's all your virtue it's your virtue
go to haneuljae with guards now
yes sir
are you happy
doctors and people can come back it's like dream come true
yes yes go now go
yes prince
you must achieve it
let's go  yes
it's so similar
it looked the same with jang's
why does prince of baekjae have it
had jang's father tributed it to prince
the necklace related to taehaksa doctor
what is going on
does dr mok know this what about him
princess kim saheung is here
please let him in
you've done a really huge job
what brings you here
finally doham was designated as doctor
really when is it
it's tomorrow
when he's designated he'll get the baekjae singi
now all his missions are accomplished
i just reported it to the king and massacre was allowed
i see
the necklace is the only thing that
my father left for me
and she told me to go to dr mok
to get acknowledged from him
if so
getting acknowledged from him leads to find my father
if dr mok dies
doctor this is giroo
come in
you can't get sleep
what is that
this is the 7 regulations you must swear in designation
wherever you are you must look forward to baekjae
that's correct
doctor i want to ask you something
not as your disciple but as giroo
no you asked me last time
i want to ask you this time
in haneuljae of baekjae
no do you really want to be a doctor of taehaksa
we were thrown away for 10 years already
and we don't know whether we can go back or not
why do you want to be with me
why do you say that
you weren't at taehaksa in the first place
baekjae hasn't provided anything to you
isn't silla and baekjae ideology to you
not as dr mok but as a human mok rasoo
i want to give you a freedom of choice
do you really want to be with me
yes
i can't wait let's go to jingak temple
princess it's the situation of massacre
it's better not to be involved in this
i'm not trying to involve i must know something
stop eating we won't have anything on the table
listen we must be silent
men will be standing at the entrance of this maze
go to back door  yes
go and check the situation
yes
i haven't been a doctor for 30 years
doctor giroo congratulation
it's been hard for you
the doctor designation hasn't been held so long
nobody can neglect i was very helpful to dr giroo
today's designation is under princes's authority
and dr mok will progress it
you may start it
i acknowledge your ability and
i now pronounce as a doctor
thou receive the 7 regulation
what happened isn't designation over yet
soon it'll be over
i can't wait i got to go and see it
princess princess
we'll give the wisdom of three nations understand the heaven
we'll give the skill of three nations exploit the earth
we'll give the culture of three nations manage the ocean
this is our unity the spirit of three nations
now you are authority to see and learn
all knowledge and techniques in baekjae singi

you've done it well
surely you can find yourself

it's been so long
lord my lord
from your man
i heard how you lived in silla
i heard how you kept the pledge of royal
that is enough
that proves me your royalty upon me
thank you for your kindness
listen  yes lord
from now on nobody
nobody is going to talk about incident 10 years ago
if anyone talks about it
i'll treat it as disroyal and disrespect towards me
yes lord
prince how can i reply your grace
it's not my grace at all
i feel sorry for how you had to struggle until now
please don't be sir
now i see you again in the palace
i feel like i gained thousand troops
now be the master of taehaksa
and refunction taehaksa as it is
the direct department of emperor
raise baekjae with technology
and produce talent people on every sectors
that is the way to raise king's authority
yes sir i'll do anything to achieve it
finally i brought him in with my words
don't worry about it too much
even though he's back
taehaksa isn't like the way it was in 10 years ago
from the master of 3 doctors and master of engineers
everyone is filled with our men
mok rasoo doesn't have the authority like the old time
hasn't yeon gamo's son turned up yet
no i don't think he will show up
still put a man on it
yes sir
i thought i'd never see here again
me too
when my husband died and we were thrown away
i really thought i could never see here again
why you shed your tears on this good day
right mother
yes let's go inside
welcome  engineer gulchi
yes engineer mojin you're welcome here
it must have been hard  no we are
no from outside of baekjae you never rested studying
you helped us in every aspect how could i not know
everyone in here taehaksa admires you
so tonight in front domitory
small party will be held
is that so
are you holding a party for us
of course it's all ready now
i truly thank you this is heaven
and are bedrooms ready
yes
you guys had enough so rest for a few days
you considered us very generously this is like a dream
i can't express how happy i am
it's nothing please rest
please follow me  yes
this is excellent
in fact too good that i have nothing to say
that's right i wouldn't mind being punished
i wanted to go back if i can but not anymore
right this is dream come true  yes
but jang where the hell is he
why
to say thank you
is he gonna be ok why can't he wake up
he was moved long while he was bleeding too much
please save him you need to save him
this is taehaksa
there are excellent medical doctors
and there are good medicnes too so don't worry too much
yes please save him
taehaksa doesn't know about indigo dye
the master of taehaksa
i'm the master again
who came to my room without permission
perhaps a daughter of bu yeogye
yes doctor
i'm wooyoung you taught me the royal family education
yes you grown up a maiden
so i couldn't recognize you forgive me please
no i should have greet you
doctor wooyoung
is anything wrong
here you are dr mok
i wanted to deliver
you two can talk
if you're a doctor
yes i continued my interest on studying and became a doctor
now i'm the master of taehaksa
pardon
it's all because of you doctor
royal family is the master of taehaksa
and who is a daughter of bu yeogye
when i was young
i waved the flag here it's called yoohak
frankly i waved the flag
you were cyring all the time
how come thre aren't many students
this is where royal family study
really  yes
so tonight in front domitory bright kids get picked
and educate with royal family together
to compete and extent their talent
then do they learn the same thing
if they teach about weapon
taehaksa teaches technology of metallurgy
but royal family education teaches about strategy on the war
weapons are used in different geology
so they learn about 3 nations geology so it's different
if they go through yoohak do they become trainees
no you fool
from 9 to 14 years old they are pretrainee
from 15 to 18 years old they are trainees
just like we did in haneuljae all those studies
they learn hardcore theory
and learn stuff in workshop like to die for
why eunjin  why
why would i come back here again
what  you freaked us
no we have to think about it again
they kill people here i'm going i'm going back
hey we're not trainees anymore
right we get government position
right that's correct
that's the difference
i will received any position here
what are you talking about we get position
taehaksa doesn't allow any government posiiton
that's only for doctors
so baekjae has internal offices of
blank
mokbo bupbu hoogungbu
blank
blank
you know there are 12 external and 10 internal offices
yeah  when these people become
engineers they take position of their specialty
for example if you make a good knife you're in dobu
what if good at astronomical phenomena
you will hold ilkwanbu position
so the worker of taehaksa can do work for country
do they leave taehaksa
no they have to build a castle
or if during a war you have to go and see the display
but normally you stay here to work
anyway we are
blank
blank
blank
sol official 5 duk official 5 6 japyung
we receive one of 16 official rank and work for it
yes now we're doing the work of nation
this happiest day will never come back again
i'm happy to be back and baekjae knows our heart
but what i feel the most is gratitude
the trust and loyalty that haneuljae people showed me
i'll never forget it in my life
thank you
where is the engineer mack dosoo
he has to be here
to ask doctor to stop talking and drink quickly
where is he
this is me let's drink it
i knew you'd be here
i knew you'd in bumsang's room
sir
i'm sorry
i'll be your son instead of him
i'll be a great man instead of him
alright
i thought i forgot and live
right
thanks thank you
thank you
thank you
but it's bit shamed
the dream of love that i and your mom couldn't reach
i hoped you'd reach for it
what happened to the woman you ran away with
i don't know whether he's dead or alive
i sent men to silla immediately
if they died with arrows
if they died
i can't understand it at all
even if you're young
how could she order not to chase them
i cannot understand it
princess king is here
why are you here kim
yes i came to discuss the sudden appearance of soldiers
and kim doham who was taken away
i know it all  pardon
why did you go to haneuljae and why did you
stop soldiers who were chasing them
i don't know what you're saying
princess has never been there
this story came from one of your man kim
sorry it's
confess now why you were there
and why you stopped the man
speak anyone speak
it's not true lord
princes was there to see kim doham
she never ordered to stop chasing them
is this true is he telling the truth
i'll ask one more time is this true
is this true
yes it is true
you must not say it
if you think about doham don't say anything
get sunhwa's maid and guards investigate them
yes sir
do anything to speak the truth
and don't make rumor go around
yes sir
what's wrong  follow me
us
it's the order from king follow me quietly
as you heard what you have to say from the palace
you would know
don't look each other speak
i don't know
chogi chogi
aren't you a maid of king  yes princess
then where is chogi and you're here
i don't know about her i was ordered to be here for a while
what for a while
bomyung bomyung seochung seochung
princess princess
did she really go there
and order not to chase them
yes king asked me the reason of missing mok rasoo
so i investigated kim's men
then  they won't talk
i striked them a few times
my private man knows one of kim's man
and he heard about this
therefore i told king about it
if this is true it's the great chance
to remove princess's power
anyway recently she was quite interested in work of nation
and i wasn't so comfortable
what is it
it looks like
king is arresting lady and maid
what  everyone's quiet about it
but investigation is going through
find it out  yes sir
surely there must be a story
that man is from king's palace
princess
no
open the door i'm princess
please don't princess
princess no no princess
princess
chogi
bomyung
seochung
untie them
i can't  untie them right now
it's my order
i don't care if they die continue until they will confess
yes lord
i'll say it
i'll say it
say it
i loved the man from haneuljae
what a man from haneuljae
not kim doham
no
i worried about him dying so i order not to chase them
so you mean you loved baekjae person from haneuljae
and you let him loose to save him
yes
while you saw kim doham was carried
while baekjae singi and mok rasoo were escaping
yes
alright now i will
lord lord please calm down
it's your daughter she's the princess
lord please kill me
lord
anyone is anyone out there
lock her up right now
lock her up in a single cell
so i don't see her around
reflect yourself reflect
lord it is related to the prestige of imperial
even her sin is huge it shouldn't be mentioned
i adored her so much how could she do this
what brings you here
what happened lord you don't look good
lord
i don't feel well visit me next time
yes
how did it go  it looks quite serious
seeing him furious it would be noisy
find out wie's man knows kim's man
so find out everything you can
yes sir
has the kid from baekjae returned
yes haneuljae safely went to taehaksa
how about doham
he's still unconcious
what unconcious  yes
the fortunate thing is people of haneuljae tried to
save him whatever they could do
so he'll wake up don't worry
how can this how can this
don't worry as soon as he wakes up
i'll safely bring him back
what is it  it's little strange
what is  it looks like
princess sunhwa is dragged in

duke seodong

kim doham
i'm sorry
giroo it's me jang do you see me
jang
yes me
here where am i
taehaksa  taehaksa

taehaksa in baekjae  yes we're back
giroo are you alright
you've been sleeping for so long
i was so nervous what if you don't wake up
no arrow damaged your bone and you bleed too much
yes you should lay down for a while
otherwise it can get worse you may be disabled
you guys bring decoction
yes  yes
i came all the way to taehaksa
what were goosan and men were doing
if not jang you'd be in silla
he brought you here
and he was looking after you since then
how did jang come back to haneuljae
he helped prince aja in chunwie battle
but taehaksa is little strange
strange why
maybe it's just me i think people are little cautious
it's weird
maybe you just got back here
it's not that anyway i feel weird
giroo is concious
yes
it's good you two did good job
it's nothing
i and gomo have to go to entire engineers meeting
you take care of giroo
yes
are you ok you might get bedsore
so tell me if you're uncomfortable
it's good you're alive
i heard a story
you dragged me out of hell
you'd do the same for me
thanks anyway
still king is pursuing the question
to develop method of making soo's paper
whole quantity imports from soo
we have to send many gold as well
all workshop must assist each other
and develop it in near future
yes sir
have you started it already
we didn't get any message we just found out
yes so hand over the key of secret workshop
we can't check medicines since we can't get in
that  why
you've been gone for 10 years
what are you saying
don't go crazy and listen
you've been in enemy's country for 10 years
since i don't know how you lived there
i just can't hand over the key of secret workshop
are you suspecting us
although you're accepted by prince aja
you'd know we have rules in taehaksa
what rules of taehaksa prince's order
why don't you give my father a klin
i wasn't ordered to
he had it 10 years ago why don't you give it to him
i don't mind whether they give it to me or not
but this is not right dad
you're damn freaking out and saying
look here why aren't you giving a klin to us
on his first week he drank 3 days
and late for 2 days he got 5 penalty points for last 10 days
he's worse than ms mojin
so you were watching him for 10 days
this isn't sleezy easy place like haneuljae
what you bastard
you bastard  let go let go
bumro bumro  let it go
what's wrong bumro stay calm
i'm sorry
you sick bastard
what's wrong
they were ignoring us
we came out of nowhere and we're threat to them
they are justjealous of us
time will work things out naturally
i think we'll be interviewed
what the hell
who are the parents
how we got in haneuljae stuff like that
it felt like i was questioned
for now we're placed in workshop
this damn things
bumro you look better with smile
how do you do i'm jang from haneuljae
i just got back from looking after injured patient
has sand scoop finished
yes
is this it
yes this helps us to
scoop the porcelain clay which is material for pottery
make it work  yes
right pottery engineer is different continue developing it
that's complement
you'll soon become a doctor
are you saying this is not mine
this is the same earring that i made
are you saying i copied your style
if not how can it be the same
moreoverjust your points had gone up
i don't know this i made it before you come
but the shape is  you're so arrogant
you think i copied you
what is it
this i made and showed it to you in haneuljae
so
i made a report to look good of me
that engineer's name was on with it today
and her point is up
this is baekjae singi i revised and enlarged
whose baekjae singi is this
what do you mean whose it is
this must not be your personal thing
it's the baekjae imperial's
sure it is
if taehaksa is in danger master must keep it safe
that was your personal danger
it wasn't the danger of taehaksa as far as i know
you had suspicion of treason
not the whole taehaksa was
but at that time prince aja
are you talking about support from prince
have you forgotten we must not involve in politics
if you want the position of master with support from prince
i'll give it to you
but us 3 doctors and
rest of doctors disagree
so please decide what you will do
is it true that you're not the master here
have you heard it
yes every workshop has its rumor
it's all over the workshop
how can this how can this be
yes it doesn't make sense
have you heard it
that he's not the master of taehaksa
no where he volunteered to go
where did he volunteer
doctor
it's ok
doctor
why are you gathering around at work hours
go back to your place
these bastards
bumro bumro
taehaksa is too different it changed too much
they don't treat us right it's so unfair
please speak to prince aja
prince aja brought us to do those things
why are you backing off by yourself doctor
jang is right
doctor is the only one who can get it right
do not back off yourself please
well done you're my daughter
i was curious for reason to decline him it's just like you
i only followed the rules of taehaksa
the weakness of him is the rules
you obviously knew it
mok is for sure haneuljae must not be part of here
otherwise it gets dangerous
what the hell are you doing
crown prince
i'll make him a master with my order
you shouldn't prince  i shouldn't
even if you're the master of taehaksa
you don'tjust order a position
you need 3 doctors' unanimous votes for it
i can fix it i can fix the whole thing
you must not prince
you must not use the same way to them
i will never be the one like that
you gotta talk to the prince
that's right it's not because it's unfair to us
when i was furious
young trainee came and advised me
what  this is normal
like this
from one day bu yeosun's people came to taehaksa
since then method bribery has started secretly
method bribery  yeah what's that
bu's people report what i make
what
that's why they become doctor and engineer quickly
what about who actually made it
if he gossip without knowing he's out
but if he stay quiet they look after him
gosh it's not right how can this
you've done well again  thank you
now 1 or 2 more to be a doctor
keep up the good work
you bastard
sir you invented this
you thought of this scoop right
psycho
father will be worried i have to make a contact
excuse me is this where dr giroo stay
yes who is it
who is it
i was asked to deliver from yoohak
delivery
if he is awake
i can deliver this when you're alone
i see
then excuse me
i'm goosan
when you recover come to motel in market
do not forcer yourself just think about your body now
i have never thought taehaksa is like this
that's what i'm saying
they are trying to test us
they know we won't follow them
doctor is disappointing me
how could he give up so easily
i told prince that i tried to support him what i can do
i heard that you wanted to have strength
is it wrong you don't like that
no i do have power as well
then why are you doing this
why don't you use the power which is given already
is it against the rule
they're against the rule not me
then why are you backing off
now prince needs you more than anything
he wants you to make taehaksa properly
but what is this please tell me the reason
doctor
are you ok
i heard everyone's not happy here
no nobody is i don't get doctor either
get up now
get up and work for baekjae
have you forgotten the woman
jang jang
jang
prince wants to see you
prince
i heard you asked me to come
yes  is something i can do
i will confer you appropriate position for your merit in battle
appropriate position
for the merit from battle king has granted my wish
that is so
i want to use talent in the right position
i confer you naesol in foreign affair
sir only engineer master can hold the position
and it assumes responsibility of personnel and management
i just got back and i'm still trainee
why
looking at bu yeogye's personnel report
ultraright person became hansol
wouldn't he deserve to be the one
what what
jang is entrusted the naesol of taehaksa
yes
damn it
what he's still a trainee
engineer of matster can hold the position of naesol
yes
how this is going to
already you improved king's health by ondol from haneuljae
and i don't need to mention your merit from the battle
it's simply he's performed merits
i've been watching him
and i figured he's qualified for this
so accord all and assist naesol
look after us look after us  hey
yes
now i understand the doctor
so i'm trying to take longer way
does it has to be longer way  that's your choice
you didn't refuse his order that's foolish
have you known this
they stayed together is this true as well
yes i'll do it
whoever doesn't pass this promotion test
leaves taehaksa
jang doesn't know the situation and system it's dangerous
is this what you tried
this will scatter haneuljae people
what is that you're willing to see
my power i want to see my power
anyone can say i'll find your merit
i will find your name
i thought i'd never see you again episode 19
welcome
you guys had enough so rest for a few days
if you're a doctor
now i'm the master of taehaksa
i loved the man from haneuljae
lock her up right now
lock her up in a single cell so i don't see her around
duke seodong
it's me jang do you see me
i came all the way to taehaksa
what rules of taehaksa prince's order
are you suspecting us
why don't you give my father a klin
this isn't sleezy easy place like haneuljae
is it true that you're not the master here
doctor is the only one who can get it right
do not back off yourself please
what the hell are you doing
you must not use the same way to them
method bribery
i confer you naesol in foreign affair
psycho
well done you're my daughter
i only followed the rules of taehaksa
now i understand your mean
when we borrow prince's power we have another authority
then nobody will study the nature in taehaksa
only general's power and prince's power will remain
prince's power means only people of haneuljae
so even if you become the master
you'll be left with only haneuljae
yes they will isolate themselves
so i'm trying to take longer way
if i want to different destination with general i must go different way
does it has to be longer way
please tell me
that's your choice
you'll do it right you'll clear my false charge
you've merits so they won't do anything
just do it
yes we'll help you do it
we can'tjust undergo with it
i never thought that taehaksa is like this
same here
this is not right you should step forward
jang doesn't know the situation and system it's dangerous
plus engineers are still young
i'm worried if their minds would change
please step forward and stop jang
i want to do this
right do it
doctor
do it
yes
you should stop him
what in the world
i want to see something
see something
doctor
this is jang who is conferred as naesol
i'll go in and greet her
i'm jang who is conferred as naesol
you didn't refuse the order
that's foolish
go out
if this isn't precise we've a problem
precisely
i'd like to know the number of people in taehaksa
who is in charge of each workshop and how promote is done
it's all there
can't you tell me while you go around
i don't have the luxury now
why did you call us
you guys can help me out
what is it
it's number of people and their experience for all workhsops
ask people and find out precisely
alright
is this all
yes
i will help anything like this
please get us back where we belong
yeah engineer gomo and mojin
can't go to their meeting yet
and young and soji haven't been arranged their workshop
and we have no mission or position either
excuse
excuse
the engineer who copied mine
she's the head engineer of metallurgy's sister
she became an engineer not long she got here
same in the dye workshop i think he's general's people
dad said that people have good talent and stayed too long
there are too many people staying as engineers
that's the same as other workshop
i get it find out in detail anyway
alright
i feel like i'm a different person
is it because you said you want to see her alive
i got to see her again
i don't wanna see her like the past when i was powerless
forget her you can't see her again she's mine now
it's been over a year
when will you develop it get out if you don't have talent
didn't you use our papers
it's all soo's
then why didn't you develop it
because we have no talent why
they don't support us
i asked them to bring many types of wood they won't
i asked them to make a machine they won't
damn it i should really quit this
i've been hassled over a year damn it
what happened
yes all papers are imported
so we have to pay soo with a lot of gold
prince aja and general ordered us to
develop it but it's not that easy
may i have your name
i'm makhae
you've been in metallurgy for 8 years and you're good at it
how did you
your name is jangbo
you've been here for 7 years
i'm dolsye and 13 years ok
13 years why are you still engineer
because i'm dumb why
really dumb
bloody youngster comes in and takes naesol
bro you've been here more than 10 years and still engineer
why bother to live huh
why it's good to see younsters doing things
excuse me jang dr wooyoung wants to see you
did you want to see me
doctors held a meeting what to do with haneuljae members
all of you need to take promotion test
that means you can't admit the system of dr mok
including you all are taking promotion test
yes i will take it
instead engineers who were here for 10 years
let them take the test with us
what's the reason
there's no reason
i checked the number of people and many of them
were over 10 years and still engineers
they have to be organized in any way
you don't acknowledge my system
let's do that
whoever doesn't pass this promotion test
leaves taehaksa
whether they're haneuljae or experienced engineers
yes but please make it open test
open  yes
alright that would be clear
oh my buddha oh my buddha
cut it out dad
i trusted him i really did
he could have sacked me quietly
i'll be embarrassed after test and get sacked
oh my how can he do this to me
you can do it well
do it well my eyes are blurry and i'm too old for that
i thought jang was rectifying here why is he killing us
that's what i'm saying
jang would have no choice
so we have to help him with our talent
how  is it
no  i think so
that's why he asked for open test
open embarrassment
but why are experience engineers doing with us
maybe that's why he asked us to do that
right he'd have his idea let's check it out
don't go just warm your body here
they will wield him
jang can't do this
doctor this will scatter haneuljae people
jang you can stop it now
this will make things harder for doctor
the situation will flow as they wield
i know you tried to raise our pride
so you asked for experienced engineers to do it with us
that gave our bad impression to people
who is nothing to do with authority and us
i'm not saying i don't know your will and provocation
let's just wait for doctor
jang
please help me
what is it
don't you know
i don't care you got the trust from prince
why you touch us to do the test
what the hell do you think you are
i only followed the rule
you can't get promoted for 10 years i understand
invention is not anyone can do
what  instead you have to be expert at it
what the hell are you saying
anyway if you don't pass this test you all must leave here
i'm letting you know
jang
why did you make those engineers to take test together
is there any reason
i want to know what i'm suspecting
anyway we can't avoid test
right that would make us clean
yes we just have to show them our talent
nobody should be failed
you heard jang you get kicked out if you fail
so what
you always have stomache before the big test
and we get wrong what you know
if you do that we have to say goodbye
so practice now try harder
make a loop until i count to 10
that's
start 1 2  wait wait
3 4 5 6 7
8 9 9 and half and half  almost done
10
here
little late again
don't worry about me
go to sir mack and do something
don't worry he's determined
finally heaven has given me up
he is determined
i haven't seen him working hard for long
engineer mack dosoo
be well haneuljae family please don't forget me
what what is this
it's just sad poem of regreting the farewell
engineer mack
i'm trying to end everything now
i don't want to cause any trouble to haneuljae
i should
i saw spirit in your pottery
put it in your pottery that's it
it's related to our pride you must do it
i trust you will do this
i trust you too
it depends on haneuljae's pride
trust
the test will be in 15th at 9 o'clock
ok
for haneuljae's test engineer gulchi will provide
for taehaksa i'll provide it
alright
for my test i ask you to give it to me
i see
start now
the test will be held in court let's go to court
it's not practical
right
have a seat where your name is on
it's about your specialty
draw what you're asked
never
it'll start with the sound of bell
please ring it
why are you sitting at my seat
look at your name here  mack do
it's here here
this  go
please do the open grading too
impartiality doesn't guarantee without open grading
please do the open grading too
i get it but how
the head engineers of each workshop come front please
sit on the engineers seat
and simply answer the question
i made a question with what was invented in workshop
so simply draw your answer please
do that
do it  yes
proceed now
yes
grade the answers
i have two drawings here
one is the same as original and another one is yours
if two drawings match there's no problem
if not one is copied or stolen
please start
same
next
correct
next
it's different
who is eunjin answer is wrong
it is not i drew it right
really
bring the original draft
it's the same
how did it happen
engineer soyoung copied it
confess
i drew what i reflected
mark it  yes
next
same
next
it's different
how did it happen
mark it
it's different
mine is correct
this part and this part is different
engineer dolsye drew it right
this invention is very new
and i know you got a lot of points for this
what are you saying
are you sure you made this
what are you insulting me
so you think a few engineers
reported what they haven't made
yes
method bribery is in place
yes
that's not possible
if it does i'll abandon them
has anyone bribed your method
has anyone
no
has anyone bribed your method
i didn't intentionally do it
my idea was reported without knowing it
you can tell me has anyone done method bribery
we've never done it
did head engineer steal your invention
no
this is wrong
if you invented yourself it's your merit
if everyone assisted it's everyone's merit
it's not because name and honor are important
you have to do this to put your heart into study
we're meant to do that
has anyone done method bribery
we've never done it
are you sure  i'm sure
anyone can tell me i'll get your merit back
i'll get your name back
you've done it more than 10 years you're still an engineer
come on tell them
what are you afraid of
tell them
taehaksa shouldn't be like this
only one person got stolen her method
only haneuljae people are telling me there was bribery
you drove taehaksa to currupted group
neverthless i'll leave haneuljae people who passed the test
you're responsible for me and taehaksa's disgrace
from now on you no longer perform your position
i'll deliver my mean to prince aja
he's bright but still young
that's right he thought expose will do the rest
we're not that easy
what about mok is he still in storage
yes
what a fox
nobody admitted it so jang has to resign it
for this taehaksa is very confused
he wouldn't have done it without an idea
but no one comes out
he wanted to change the taehaksa
but wooyoung will gain more vigor
what's dr mok's intention
they have maintained the group without us for 10 years
did you think they will collapse for your one exposure
people don't change their mind easily
nor the group will
so is this the end of what you tried
doctor
there's nothing except prince
doctor why are you doing this
what is it doctor
what is that you're willing to see
my power i want to see my power
i'm not weird person
how are you gonna live in taehaksa now
but we're acknowledge because of jang
acknowledgment is not important
they ignore us and treat us like insects
it's scarier and shaking
it's comfortable looking at their sign
right i can't live like this
we have to live together
if we have to stay here that's better for us
now we can sleep in peace what's the matter
you have no one else to lookout
and with your audacity you can deal with it not us
i'll be dead silent let's not gather like this anymore
right  yes
he saved you when you were dying
i saw your eyes last night
what
they were shaking
what the hell
i'm not telling you to do big thing
things that i made become mine and seeing people use it
you may want to make better one
hey get rid of him
i'll come back tomorrow think about it
why are you doing this
i'm trying to convince you
you've gone insane
i want to put a mask on
get your mind set jang
jang
have you given it pleasantly if so i will go
stop it
you put your heart into it without any bad feeling
then i'll go
our identities aren't good but i'm just happy to work here
no it shouldn't be like that at all
heaven has given your talent without identity
therefore taehaksa has to be equal for everyone
i thought it was like that when i first came in
why are you blocking other people
why are you afraid of getting acknowledged
you're a coward you should be ashamed of yourself
i will never give up you can't defeat me
young master
please have a seat here
are you alright
i feel like tired
then why did you come out
until goosan comes please take a rest
alright
how the hell did you come to here
do you know something
frankly
frankly princess came to haneuljae
ordered us not to chase jang who was carrying you
what pricness did
it shouldn't go for long
what if it gets exposed what would you do
lord please calm down
she went out with baekjae person
surely she was seeing baekjae person
yes he's the engineer of haneuljae
and princess helped him to escape
yes notjust escape they lived together for a while
how did she know him
he was the guy of sedongyo
and he used to be her guard for a while
and kim saheung knew all of these
yes his second son tried to pacify it
so he ordered us to be silent
didn't you go to meet giroo
we have a problem
what is it
i didn't know our man is close to wie's man
so what happened
i think he talked princess
what
sir
what is it
all of asristocrats from seorabul are coming to palace
what they escaped and lived together
i'm very sorry to alert
but it is true
plus when soldiers pursued them
she tried to kill herself to save him
so what can we do it
the rumor is spreaded all over the city
it's ashamed if he's silla person
he is baekjae person
this is really shameful
you got it all wrong
since she took a job in naesung
you knew everything about this
you found it out through your son
and you knew he is the person of seodongyo incident
why didn't you report it to the king
is that true you knew all about it
when princess and the man escaped
it was his men who pursued them
what did you really know about this
the reason why the rumor is spreaded is because of his men
you despised not only king but whole imperial
is that true
is princess chunmyung telling the truth
no question is needed
palace and market are so noisy as well as hwarang
you should lock him up
the rumor is so disgraceful that i can't believe it
it must not be true isn't it
please kill us
they lived together is it true
what drove you so reckless
it's out of my hand now
how can i do how
have you been well
brother your waist is bad so i can
he didn't come
didn't come
he's been too hassled so he won't come to work
that's good
his waist isn't well so i can massage him
do you how many people absent because of you
they informed me that they won't come to work for a while
here i drew this
i told you i won't look at your stuff
if you don't look who will look at mine
report it to dr wooyoung directly
is this because of the last time
if so i'm really sorry
you guilty people are still digging up
you're always asking the engineers
that's not me i don't do that
aren't you guys tenacious haneuljae people
i i
she won't accept it
since engineer does that other comrades won't talk to me
same here they won't reply back
it makes me tired
that's same as me but
so please stop him jang never gives up so they do to us
but he's trying hard
what hard i got to live first
since we came here we can just live quietly
even doctor is quiet and why is he doing it
calm donw i'll find him and talk with my dad
jang
stop it
i was wrong if they will change their mind easily
but it already happened
if i stop now their mind will shut down even more
and they won't trust us
you shouldn't do that
i have to convince them until they trust me and my heart
at least one person
what about haneuljae family
they can't even talk and live in cold situation
what about them
please help me
that's what dr mok kept for long
jang
mom did you talk to jang
he doesn't listen
i can't take it anymore it's too hard
either i beat him or i have to say i'm dying
bumro and his dad will go and talk to him
you have to come with me mom
let's go
it's so noisy because of haneuljae i put more for this time
yes thank you
what are you doing here
i said what are you doing here
what is this
is this it
you sold your name for this
how much is it
all the machines that you thought and drew
how much does it cost to buy
people get to smile with your machine
and they thank you for it
how much is it to replace that
how much is it to replace your name on baekjae singi
i'll buy it all
i'll tell prince and buy it all
who are you threatening to name prince
take care of him quietly
yes
what are you doing
hit him  no
it's dangerous ms mojin
if you ever touch him a bit  i'll kill all of you
you got the wrong people
you can never win this fight
do you know why
jang does what he's got to do
i scolded him for 10 years but he never stopped what he wants
do you know the second reason
we're next to him
we know jang is right and we'll never leave him alone
right we'll never leave him alone
what the hell you wanna die
let's go
you four there
shh nothing but cowards
are you hurt
there you are
this is him grandma
grandma wants to ask you something
go on
you know
can little technique leave my name on the book
of course this man will do whatever he needs to do
honestly i've been starched clothes for 30 years here
it can be nothing but i have 10 years old riped starch
i thought it'd be nice to make papers
but taehaksa seemed to have trouble
and it's not my specialty so i didn't take it out
but can you leave my name
it can be great worth before i die
what are you doing jang she's asking you
she's asking you to leave her name
yes i will i will leave your name no matter what
then i'll believe in you
can i believe in you
yes
leave my name on it
yes i will leave it
i do what i need to do and i have haneuljae people with me
i designed the machine for making papers
really
then we have a job to do
when i starched this no insect lay their eggs
take a look
do you press papers with it
yes put moist paper and dried paper
before paper get dried you press it
isn't it the same principle as ironing
yes it makes the surface very smooth
and paper gets thin and ink will spread evenly
gather up after work
so how do you do starch
if you ripe it it spreads out well in water and last long
what do you do with paper mulberry grind in millstone
tap it grind it and pound it
pound it how
beat it like you wash the clothes
if we need to make it smooth we need many materials
dr mok is in storage i'll find it out
he'll steal it if it's for invention
so who's making reed screen
isn't it tiresome make jang to do it
why me
because you're tiresome you do it
yes tiresome and longer ones make him do it
and creepy ones too he's so creepy
is it that serious
yes lord
if you listen to their demand our damage is severe
neverthless progress has been very slow
make a plan
we need to make it with our method
whoever invents it reward them enough
yes lord
i told you to make it ages ago
you still don't have good result
did you deliver its urgency
we don't have skill yet rushing it won't work
what happened to taehaksa's technology
it depends on nation's benefit why is it so slow
we're doing our best
bu yeosun came last time now it's prince's turn
did someone burn something last night
what is it
there are a lot of ashes
frankly there is mark of using paper box
have we been robbed
nothing's missing but mark's of use
you're harsh
if your mean is this invent the papers
soon soo's messenger will be here
they will ask for unreasonable demand for their papers
yes sir
he's in dr mok's room
yes
how is mok rasoo
he's stuck in storage
how about jang
jang and haneuljae people are very quiet
please go in it looks like it'll rain
i'm sorry  you fool
damn  we've a problem
i'm inqurying my greet
who are they
they're engineers of haneuljae
isn't he jang
what are they doing follow me
yes
hurry hurry
what the hell are you doing here
why are you gathered here and doing what
you should go inside it's beginning to rain episode 20
sorry  impudent child
oh no  we're in trouble
greetings ma'am
who are they
they're the people of haneuljae
isn't that jang
what are they doing here follow me
yes
hurry hurry
what do you think you are doing
why are you haneuljae people here what are you doing
answer me
yes i'd like to know myself what is all this
it's paper as you can see
is this the paper that you have made
yes
crown prince this paper is much better than the paper from soo
really how do you know
feel it
paper must be strong smooth and the surface must be perfect
to prevent ink blots
how do you know such things
a drop of water can show you
look the water spreads in the same width
and that's not all
no
the paper that we used to use weren't mothproof and rotted easily
but not this one
how can you be so sure
we used glue fermented for 10 years
it has adhesive strength and prevents the paper from rotting
oh how amazing
and you're telling me that you and the people of haneuljae made this
no
no
others have made this paper
this old lady gave us the fermented glue
and this man here designed the club for beating the paper
this is how we were able to make paper
more strong and less spreading
we the people of haneuljae only helped these two
su has always asked for the precious tax of our people for their paper
but now we can make our own much better than su
this is possible because of people like you in great baekjae
so let their names be recorded in the new book baekjae shinki
and let baekjae remember them forever
doctor this is what you wanted to see is it not
this is the strength that you wished to see is it not
crown prince has told us to gather in the assembly hall
you have done a great work
make as many paper you can before the envoy from su arrives
yes
what you could not do for over a year
these people of haneuljae have done as soon as they came here
my lord it was the people who were already in the palace that did it
that is what i'm saying
there were people who already knew how to make it
but none of you found them how come
was it a disobedience towards me
no my lord
then then what
what is it
we have something to tell you
punish us
what do you mean
the truth is that we lied during the last test
and made jang lose his position
you lied
ignoring the duties of studying nature we paid to the authorities in skill
what paid to the authorities in skill
yes
jang prepared a test for us to prove that
but you all refused
yes my lord so punish us
if what you are saying is true there will be people to punish
don't you agree doctor wooyoung
i will investigate thoroughly and
deprive the position of engineers who were paid in skill
is that all
i will also take responsibility from this situation
and step down from head position
doctors vote the head of taehaksa once again
is it true we're voting again
yes
but everyone knows that doctor mok rasoo will become head
of course
it should have been that way from the beginning
now taehaksa seems to going in the right way
no more bullying for us
it's wonderful jang is a great man he didn't give up
not only jang eunjin too
saying because we're here in front of all those scary people
i was just amazed
hmph that was nothing
here comes jang
i have lost
you are certainly better than me
i have done nothing this time
the greatest thing that you did
is that you did nothing
i have learned a great lesson
doctor was taking a risk
a risk
if you didn't go for it till the end
and if the people of haneuljae didn't understand you or help you
doctor would have lost this game
but you didn't give up and the people of haneuljae helped you
and doctor won he won this game of fate
i wasn'tjust gambling
i wanted to teach you something
i have heard from the crown prince that you wanted power
what power did you feel this time
what did you feel
people i felt the power of people
if there aren't the people of haneuljae who have the same goal with me
i wouldn't have been able to do anything on my own
yes and you are my power my strength
i have shown them today my biggest power
who's that
boo yeosun
importing paper from su was a bigger benefit to the aristocrats
because of the new skill in making paper
aja will derive all the benefits
but you shouldn't step down just because of such things
if i didn't step down we would have been cut off from taehaksa
mok rasoo has taught us a lesson and we should learn
and we should prepare a new fight
master
i believe we can go a long way now
do you
now that the position of doctor is confirmed i can see
the baekjae shinki and make a copy of it
let's meet here three days later
yes
but it has been a long time since gusan left and he hasn't returned yet
i'm worried that something may have happened to him
what is going on
this is kim sa heum's home
it's an order from wesong
put down all your weapons and do as we say
what is it
there has been an order to reinvestigate your soldiers
about hiding away mok rasoo and his people
hiding away how dare you
we'll find out about that so please follow
it has been decided at the hwabaek meeting let's go
inform the king
what is it
you have been summoned to the hwabaek meeting
what
follow us
what's the matter
in silla there are soldiers who do that kind of work
why did you send private soldiers in catching mok rasoo and his people
because
and why did the baekjae soldiers come on the day when the doctors were appointed
that i do not know
even if he had been wounded
and dragged to baekjae he should have returned by now
where in the world is kim doham
what do you mean
not telling about princess sunhwa's transference sending private soldiers
the exact day when the baekjae soldiers appeared
and kim doham who disappeared hasn't come back yet
isn't there too much to think itjust as a coincidence
then are you saying that my son doham secretly worked with baekjae
how dare you
doham is on a secret mission for the sake of silla and his king
not for silla but for himself and his family
perhaps he ignored even the hwabaek meeting and
made a secret trade with the king over princess sunhwa
what
there's no rule to stop him from working secretly with baekjae
they even freed sunhwa to keep things under countrol within the palace
why are they reinvestigating kim saheum's soldiers
it was decided at the hwabaek meeting
there was nothing that i could do
even so she is your sister you should've stopped wesong
i did try my best
but everyone in the market knew and so did the hwarangs
they all said that nothing could be done
princess what shall we do
they say they are going to reinvestigate kim saheum's soldiers
princess the king is coming
sit down
what are we to do what shall we do
forgive me your gracious
you are also a lady of the palace
you know how harsh and cruel the palace is
you know how fiercely the aristocrats are fighting over you and
princess chunmyung and dukman for the next generation
it's worse than the war between the three countries
negotiation or diplomacy can be used during war between countries
but nothing can be done in the fightings for royal power
it never ends until one has been completely defeated
your majesty i will end what i have begun
abandon me
i cannot you know how precious i thought of you
you know how i was fond of you
did you not realize that that was the reason i was
trying to marry you to kim doham and not to a stronger aristocrat
your majesty
master lee chan has already gone to bed
it's still broad daylight how can he be in bed
come again another day
master isn't home
they said he went home at the palace
what brings you here
is it true
that princess sunhwa loves a man from baekjae that she did
nothing when doham was going to baekjae wounded by an arrow
if it is true then we hwarangs will not stand still
what is the hwarang
we are people always prepared to die for the royal family and for silla
but to betray a hwarang such a cruel behavior
it will not be forgiven
and doham is he all right
why hasn't he returned yet
yes we should abandon princess sunhwa princess sunhwa
send someone quickly to baekjae and stop doham from returning
what
that's the only way for us to live
don't ever let him come back here until i give word
or we could all be destroyed
finally my mission is almost complete
what are you doing here  we came to look
look
the engineer who tormented you got degraded and now is the same rank as you
we came to see how you'd act to that
first i'll change my way of speech then tease hit and flip
bite break and make them like rags
hey let's organize our relationships
eunjin
i know we didn't start off well
but we are all members of taehaksa
let's forget the past and all the wrongdoings
and start a new friendship
i too will try my best engineer soyoung
yes let's
eunjin you look different
do i
doctor will be so proud of you as i am
if he finds out how mature you acted
it's nothing really
thank you
and come by to the paper workshop things aren't as smooth without you
help me when you can  sure
eunjin what's wrong with you how can you change so suddenly
oh what's wrong with me
maybe another person's soul came inside me
whew is soyoung gone
i could have given soyoung a good punch
i missed such a great chance what's it with me
what a pity
what what's the problem
you took the lead last time
i'm not sure if we pounded the wood or grinded it
you dummy the paper from soo was made by grinded wood
and was easily torn so we pounded wood pay attention
don't you remember
it's always like this
eunjin is the smartest after all
yes she's very accurate like ms mojin
bumro you idiot
bumro will you get out of my way
why is something wrong
mom
what now did someone accuse you of something
you hated jang
and i was also troubled by him but we went to protect him
if you touch a hair on him  i'll kill you all
it was a dangerous situation
but why did we actually defend jang like that
well that was more like sympathy i suppose
and what jang had said wasn't wrong
but why do you ask
i think someone else's soul came inside me ever since that day
what are you talking about
well i'm not sure myself
but i keep saying things i don't think and i sound like you
and i'm becoming more careful
that you're becoming like me is good news
no it isn't
i think this is well i think
jang jang
no way no way
no way
eunjin
yes it was him
jang jang
what will i do
i have heard that wooyoung decided to leave head
yes your majesty
there's still the voting left to be done
but it seems like you're decided crown prince is pleased
i hope for the same
but you should remember their power
because the brothers and nephews protect the benefits of aristocrats
they support them
aja is trying to rebuild the power of the royal family
and make baekjae strong
but if he tries too hard he will be in danger
if the aristocrats refuse to offer their soldiers we can't fight in war
and if they don't offer goods we can't manage baekjae
right now the only man who can move all the aristocrats
excpet for the jins is boo yeosun
keep that in mind
yes your majesty
after the battle of kwansansung his majesty has suffered greatly from
the aristocrats remember his words i know you will serve him well
yes
master wanggu
what is it
i have a question
what
i've heard that 20 years ago while i left taehaksa
an dancer called yeon gamo was accused by the aristocrats
do you know what happened
why do you ask
do you know her
how do you know her
actually we were to marry
what happened
she had an affair with the royal guard
and had been called to account
do you know who he was
he was killed right away
what
yes wasn't that the day before the proposition
what is it
a letter from home
what
a note came from the man we sent to achak
yeon gamo's son has appeared
what
he's at the house right now
let's go  yes
which one is he
this is him
who's this
this is the man who forged their identification tag
he knows the son without mistake
yes i do
this is the son of the woman that you were looking for
reward me as you promised
what is your mother's name
yeon gamo
what is your name
i have been moving around and i have had many names
blank
his latest name was seodong
i made the fake tag so i'm certain it's him
we called him seodong because he sold yam
give me the necklace
what the necklace
what necklace
you bastard
take them hit them and kick them out
what are you doing
take them  yes
forgive me i secretly promised them a reward
i don't think we can find him this way
if the necklace was there when aja was fighting it means he already knows
do you think he'd come here
but we searched everywhere near crown prince
and never found a trace of another prince
there must be no relation
if so if he comes in his own will
just in case we'll keep posting men
he's been killed
but then why did you tell jang that his father was alive
what had happened yeon gamo
what is it
um
i was wondering if it was okay to vote for mok rasoo as head
do as you want
what brings you here
the people of haneuljae had been in silla for ten years
we would like to visit our homes
do as you please
thank you
i have a request doctor
what is it
i'd like to visit home for a while
i asked for the same thing and she allowed it
what
everyone had left baekjae for a long time right
and after we came back i was busy adapting to a new life
yes
tell everyone to visit their homes
doctor says to go visit your homes
home
before then learn everything you can
from doctor mok rasoo and win his approval
and when you turn twenty come meet mom here
home home
i've heard that you lost your mother there your heart must be sore
you lost your parents by the border near your home
same thing i guess
take care
what kind of greeting is that
anyway thanks for saving my life at least i get to go home
what the
and i learned a lot from you
very funny
sometimes i used to wonder
are we the same kind of people or are we not
if we met in a different situation would've we been friends or enemies
let's not meet as enemies you scare me
father buy me clothes like this too
ask your stepmother to buy you
lady kuksoo
doctor is coming out
doctor have a safe trip
yes don't worry about me
take care all of you
yes you too
have a good trip
you too
now let's really break our unfortunate relationship
and fight as a baekjae taehaksa and a silla hwarang
what are saying
are you saying that the princess and my father are in danger
yes and master seems to have other plans
he ordered not to return until he sends word
not to return  yes
no i must go
i can'tjust stay here when the princess and father is in trouble
i can't stay here
let's go come on  but
we can go to silla and check the situation first
your majesty there is great trouble
your majesty there is great trouble
what is it
angry hwarangs have rised in revolt everywhere
why all of a sudden
they say that kim doham kim doham
returned as a corpse
they say he seems to have died long ago
and it's almost impossible to recognize him
what
so the hwarangs are outraged and angry at princess sunhwa
because her love for one beakjae man caused the death of a hwarang
oh no oh no
what shall we do
they are young hwarangs they do not know how to negotiate
and as the corpse arrived it became like spilling oil on fire
kim saheum you wretched creature
he should have told me about the corpse first
but to tell it to the hwarangs
abandoning princess sunhwa so you would live
this is impossible this can't happen
this will not be
is it true that princess sunhwa abandoned hwarang kim doham
who went on a secret mission just to save a mere baekjae man
is it true that she let taehaksa's head to live while kim doham died
we will not forgive her we cannot forgive her
we will not forgive her we cannot forgive her
we cannot let this be passed by
if she let taehaksa's man live and let a hwarang die
it is an act of betrayal
true
we must go and tell this to the king
yes
let's tell poongwulju and give this to the king
give it to the king
if the situation goes on like this sunhwa will not be able to recover
but we cannot get rid of kim saheum
the hwarangs are in an uproar
and kim saheum's family is protected
the aristocrats are concerned about princess sunhwa
but they are also concerned about the family of kim saheum
they are also concerened about his property and men
i've heard that the baekjae people thought him as one of them
and took him to taehaksa how did kim saheum bring his corpse here
they found his grave and the soldiers went there
found out
yes
what should we do
the hwarangs are angry enough to cause a riot
the king's power had them under control
but now princess princess
did kim doham really die
that is not important right now
did he really die
yes
princess
my sins are great too great
you are certain that you saw poongwulju go into the palace
yes
we will live
this is only known between you and me never reveal the secret
yes
gusan went to baekjae right
yes
doham must never never come back
he won't
your majesty wesong and poongwulju are asking to see you
let them in
let them in
what is it
poongwulju says he has come with a message of the hwarangs
your majesty
princess
poongwulju and wesong have gone to see the king
now what should we do
let's go
go
go to the king
what for
i cannot burden the king any longer i must go and tell him
and what will you say
hwarang is an organization that can only exist
by loyalty to the royal family and loyalty to silla
this is possible because of the faith that
the royal family can make silla a strong country
we will not abandon our faith
and we will stay forever with the royal family
and that is why we ask you and princess sunhwa to make a decision
we cannot forgive her for loving a man of baekjae but that
she cannot divide her private life from her country's fate is worse
that she let the head of taehaksa free is an act of betrayal
and to allow a hwarang to die for such a thing
makes us feel deceived and wretched
so we kneel before you and ask of your courageous decision
princess sunhwa should kill herself
and do her duty as a lady of the royal palace
your majesty
hear let all of you hear
i myself know the spirit and the loyalty of hwarangs
and so i understand the betrayal you must have felt
when princess sunhwa fell in love with a baekjae man
but
princess sunhwa did not betray anyone
i am sorry that kim doham had to sacrifice because of sunhwa
but as i searched to find him
kim doham went to baekjae by his own will betraying silla
what
is that really true
kim doham is doing well under the protection of baekjae
then the corpse kim saheum brought
it was set up by kim saheum
i have already sent people to baekjae to punish kim doham
and ordered to arrest kim saheum
so trust me and let me take care of princess sunhwa
he died to save you
princess how are you doing
i who you have let me be
am back here where i had lived with my mother
don't soldiers have mothers how can they hit the same spot
you can't even talk back when you're beaten by those bastards
you don't tell why you have a fake tag
you don't tell why you move around
you smile while you're slapped and you're just so innocent
it's just that you're using fire and flour bombs in the wrong way
if you go there they'd praise you
they'd probably say that you're a great genius
really
of course
i don't think i can make you into a great person
but jang
you must be great
you must be a great person
so you must go to taehaksa
taehaksa
he will be able to teach you well
he might come
i told you to guard well and always keep an eye on things
it's been ten years do you still think he's come
you haven't seen the house
if only seodong comes we'll be rich with the reward
same as usual huh
don't you recognize me
ninety nine to one seodong the yam seller

boss wasn't lying

yes he said someone rich was looking for me
yes it's true
we had such a hard time looking for you
i even pretended to be you once because boss told me to
what
but he asked this and that to see if it was really you
everything else boss had already prepared
since boss knew that you and your mother had fake tags
he searched and found out your names and where you lived
but they asked something about a necklace
a necklace
yes do you know what it is
a necklace
a necklace
then that person must know the mysterious jewel
perhaps my father
on your twentieth birthday meet your mother here

of course we're going to be rich
come on let's hurry to yukak master is there

actually we're no different from boss see how poor we are
we both have big families but we live like this
we don't even have enough soup
so please go to the house with us
we don't know your story
but it doesn't seem like it'll harm you
and the reward will be better used by us than boss
yes i know the house
and you can just think it as charity
yes i was thinking of going there myself
you were
thank you thank you
but where is this house
sabi
sabi
is there no news from there
yes
i think i'm wasting my time on nonsense
if he knows aja he will not be there
and he certainly doesn't have any reason to be here
they will be probably be protecting him
should we just withdraw
yes but search aja's side more deeply
yes
if there is a relation it won't be too difficult to find
yes
would it really be father really but if not it not
we were going to withdraw anyway
yes but the bastard that came last time
came again saying that seodong came
how can we believe him
that's what i thought but he said he'd risk his neck
and where is he
they lost him
lost him  yes
according to them the fake seodong and his friend took him along
and are you sure there were no other soldiers with him
yes he has appeared all alone
find him find him
yes
why are you nervous because you think it's your father
if it's true
prince aja may not know anything yet
then

episode 21
who is seodong
general tells him to come inside
this is general boo yeosun's house
i am seodong
are you seodong
are you the one who gave my mother the mysterious necklace
you know the necklace
i have heard that my father has given it
are you my father
or do you know my father
my mother told me
that when i am twenty i'd be able to meet my father
but my mother has died and i don't know what to do
do you have the necklace
i lost it
where
i don't know where
are you the one who gave me the mysterious necklace
i need to know
what's that noise  where
catch them
who was there
he had his friends with him
find them immediately and bring them here
yes
it was you
do you know the mysterious necklace
what's going on why moksuk
the reward was nothing but a lie they just wanted to kill you
and we didn't know we were blinded by money
i even pretended to be you and shoved you in
what is the necklace what is it
what are we to do surely they will kill us too
run straight home
take moksuk's family with you and leave here
where to where to
to byukjoong pomi or jiban anywhere don't let anyone know
and you what about you you're in more danger
they thought moksuk was me and killed him
right they did they did
i have heard that my father has given it are you my father
or do you know my father
how did it go
we lost them should we go find them and kill them
never mind they'd be too scared to tell anyone
but what if they were related to aja
then we should get rid of them
if they were sent to set me up we must warn them for sure
and even if they know we killed him what could they do
yes that's true
we don't have anything to say if the forth prince was murderer
aja isn't that stupid aja doesn't know anything yet
a prince that may become a headache must be cut off from the beginning
yes
why would the general want to kill me
what relationship did he have with my father what
why did he kill moksuk just as he mentioned the necklace why
why the general why why why
what is this all about
i think things have gotten worse than before
i'm not sure what's going on but i believe you should be more careful
let's go home secretly
yes
i think it's the king's plan to save princess sunhwa
yes i think so too i don't think kim doham exiled himself
the king knew there was nothing we could do with a dead man
any news from the men we sent to baekjae
not yet
sangdaedeung wesong is going in
come in
what happened
we sent a man to taehaksa and found out he didn't exile himself
of course not how can a dead man flee
he's not dead
what
then where is he
he is said to have gone home
what
kim saheum took a big risk to live
tell the soldier you know at kim saheum's house
tell him to inform us as soon as kim doham returns
yes
if we're lucky we'll be able to bury both princess sunhwa
and the family of kim saheum as we wish
who is it
master
where's father
you're right on time
what happened
your father is in prison now
in prison
the king put him in prison because you exiled to baekjae
go tell the king the truth and he will be freed
what is the grave for
not telling about princess sunhwa when he knew it all
and hiding away mokrasoo and his people to baekjae
master was confronted by the hwabaek meeting
so he tried to protect this family from destruction by using the hwarangs
he told them i died
yes
and because of that princess sunhwa was cornered
and so the king said that i had fled to baekjae
yes
first we must save master
you must prove that you didn't exile
or your father will be in great danger
it seems that the king was anxious to end this trouble
if i choose the fake exile princess sunhwa will be in danger
if i choose the fake death father will be in danger
what am i to do what
master we must do something
master
i must be presented to the king secretly
and what will you do
i will ask him for a pledge
a pledge that promises not to abandon our family
then princess sunhwa will be saved and we can expect sunny skies
would it be all right
the king did such a thing because he favors princess sunhwa
and he did it beacause he thought i was dead
he will remember my loyalty
and i am willing to sacrifrice again for princess sunhwa
he will make a pledge
i am not to be at the palace
i will write a letter for you carry it to the royal guard
yes
what he's here
yes he is at home right now
all right i will write a fake letter to kim doham pretending to be king
go and give it to him
yes
and when he is at the place where i told him to be
line up the soldiers nearby is that clear
yes
what
an urgent message your majesty
come in
your majesty kim doham has arrived
what
he wishes to see you secretly
master
come in
this is from the king
all right
let's go
go secretly to kim doham's house and give him this
yes
why are you here in this hour
your majesty
kim doham is at songjuchong surrounded by soldiers
your majesty why are you making things more difficult
what will hwarangs say when they have seen kim doham
your majesty
make a decision
your majesty
your majesty i will be waiting for your secret letter
at mukjukguri near the gate
what is it that you want
sunhwa is my daughter before she is a princess i cannot kill her
tell me what you want
speak
leave kim saheum's matter to the hwabaek meeting
and forbid princess sunhwa in all political matters
your majesty
if a royal family is forbidden to govern the country
yes your majesty
your majesty
all right do as you please
here he comes
are you the secret messenger
the king has sent this
go ahead master go ahead
hear princess sunhwa
you are now deprived of all your qualities of a princess
leave the palace and be a monk
your majesty
princess
sunhwa what are we to do
no master you need to be safe
what happened to father where's father
an order was given to destroy your family your men your properties
have been taken and your family is to be like slaves
what slaves
yes i believe this is a trap to catch you
to send him as a slave
i must save father i must
give way give way
i have gathered some men
how dare you
father
forgive me mother
forgive me your majesty
father father
father
father
more soldiers are coming
you must leave quickly quickly
the king the king can't do this to us
abandoning our family who sacrificed for silla for 15 years
your majesty you can't do this to us
you can't do this to me i who have tried my best to save you and the princess
father father
father
jang
huh
what are you thinking i asked for the glue at least ten times
oh here you go
is something wrong
no
you've been acting weird ever since you came back from home
did something happen
did i look like that
is it because of your mother
i was young back then but i still remember
your mother shot by an arrow and you crying
lean on me
when you're weak ionely and tired lean on me
what i mean is
jang
crown prince is looking for you
all right
i can never get anything done right because of him
did something go wrong
what never mind
hey how come you're so ladylike these days
because it's time for you to marry me
let's just work quietly we're the people of haneuljae
the reason why i called you today
is to ask you to be my naesole
forgive me my lord
doctor mok rasoo will now become head
and i would like to concentrate more on studies
but it would be a great help to mok rasoo
i will help doctor no matter what
do not worry
all right
i've heard that you went to visit your home did you unburden yourself
your mother died and your father is unknown am i right
yes
should i search for some information about your father
does the prince know the secret of the general
no
crown prince the king is coming
what brings you here my lord
i see that you are here too
yes
i have heard you made paper that helped the prince from his troubles
serve him well
yes
as soon as mok rasoo came
i heard that a new paper was made against our benefits
all the paper we used were brought in from soo
and the money from the merchants of soo were a great help
i know inventing things that are against the aristocrats
just as soon as they arrived this isn't good
and i heard that he is most likely to become head
shouldn't we do something about it
i don't like the idea of mok rasoo becoming the head myself
but i have to admit that baekjae needs him
then what
use him
use him
actually baekjae has been falling down
because taehaksa couldn't invent anything
and that resulted in smaller benefits for the aristocrats
yes that's true
the problem is not mok rasoo developing taehaksa
but crown prince gaining power from it
if we could use it as our power it could be done
of course that's something so much better
we must and will make it ours
the soldiers are in my hands
and all the power is in the hands of every aristocrat in every place
trust me
jang
yes
are you going to taehaksa
yes
good i need to talk to you
you do what you want to
a man must have such a huge mind
you are fit for a position in the office
do you still think that my ways are wrong
throw away your prejudice and think about it
who baekjae needs and who will make baekjae strong
you can't rule a country by heart
never by dreams either
it is only a survival through blood
i will be crushed on the moment they realize i have no power
i have this feeling that you will learn this someday
did you learn from mok rasoo since yoohakdong
no  then
since haneuljae
i've heard that all the children who went to haneuljae were war orphans
and you
yes
you're also good at fighting how did you learn
i practiced while i was at haneuljae
i may not be a man of your style but we can always share thoughts
talk to me whenever you need something
there are problems that crown prince can solve
and there are problems that i can solve
jang what's the matter
nothing
was there a threat  no
maybe they're trying to do something before doctor becomes head
i don't think so
even doctor wooyoung has lost in this situtation
doctor
should i tell him about the general
what is it
did the voting go well
there will be news soon
you and i have different mothers but we are brother and sister
so we have our similarities
unless father becomes king we will never be able to fulfill our dreams
that's why securing the aristocrats was the most difficult thing
what are you trying to say
i put taehaksa into your hands
so i will not interfere with your votings
but i need to know that we're gling in the same direction
of course
all right i trust you
you're a woman you'll have many things to go through
you will have a lot of experience
i should help father right
yes
why is boo yeosun looking for me i have to find out
i should at least post someone
are you really going to the princess
master
but she's the one who can change things around
have you forgotten that all these things have happened because of her
she is leaving home promising never to interfere with politics
so i should stop her
his majesty may abandon me but the princess can not
i will recover all this with my own hands
21 22 23 24
why is it so busy here
today is the day of entering the buddhist priesthood
the ceremony is today
yes
then do you know where the palace women are staying
the one who looks like and angel
today is her day
where is she
in that room over there
did the ceremony already begin
no it's not that
princess sunhwa has disappeared
everything is upsidedown
baekjae she went to baekjae
come everyone
dad where do you get all these
never mind just eat
what is it huh
i said never mind don't ask and don't try to find out
why what is it
everything has a season you're never sure when it will end
on the day she reveals her true self then all will end
reveals her true self who
you still don't get it
there's only one who doesn't reveal her true self these days
it's scaring me out of my wits
eunjin  who else
these are bribes eunjin is the most popular girl today
there are tons of guys who are asking me to introduce her
calling eunjin an angel fallen from the sky
dad
i told you not to ask
how can you introduce the girl your son likes to another guy
and you call yourself dad
talk straight
it's the girl you like but the daughter of the woman i like
you two are brotherandsister
if you don't stop that i'll jump into the furnace
it'll be hot
what's wrong with you these days
why is something wrong
please just be yourself like you used to
like i used to how was i like
scream kick and jump at food
just like you used to
you're acting like a shy sheep and the guys are all over you
thinking you're and angel or something
just be yourself i like the old eunjin better
bumro life is hard isn't it
taehaksa is unfamiliar i'm unfamiliar
but bumro we can't act like kids anymore
we must help doctor mok rasoo don't you agree
ms mojin do something what's wrong with her
well i'm unfamiliar with her myself troubled just like you
and worried that she will suddenly change again
mother that won't happen the old eunjin is gone now
i feel like i'm born again hit by lightning
you'll never know mother
there certainly is something with her
please tell me when you find out
good for you to have come here
why
i'd like to try the design that you did the other day
can you teach me
of course with pleasure
extraordinary
really
and um i have a favor to ask
tell me anything
you are close with that jang
yes
then please
what's this
it's nothing really it's only a headscarf that i made
will you come out for a minute
pull it out
come on pull it out
what's the matter with you
i really want to be a new person you know cooperate
huh if only you'd tell me
when someone's name is spoken my eyes flip guess who
jang
you should have known better
really all right
i'll never show myself in front of jang again
and tell the others too will you
all right
what the materials are being smuggled
there was a big gap between the raw materials and the products
even if they say taehaksa has changed
how can a person who studies steal the materials
this is because they lost heart
they lost hope in becoming doctors despite their low ranks
so now they're concerned with other things
i think so
doctor wooyoung is looking for you
all right
the voting date has been settled
when is it
the day after tomorrow  i see
and i realized that there was another doctor on the list of haneuljae people
that's giroo
i thought jang was your best disciple but i guess i was wrong
you made giroo a doctor
he has a great talent in studying and a good heart
but why isn't he here
he was wounded on his way from silla and we had no time to introduce him
right now he went home
will he be back by the meeting
i think so
has giroo come yet
no he seems to be taking long because his home is near the border
jang someone asked to give this to you
i'll be back soon
everyone's weird these days
has the date been settled
yes it's the day after tomorrow
i wish giroo would be there
me too he would be a great help
giroo is coming
i'm back
good we were hoping you'd be here before the day after tomorrow
the meeting is held then they will vote for a new head
i see but where's jang
jang went out a few minutes ago someone came to see him
what someone came who
i'm not sure he didn't say
everyone's weird so weird
first eunjin then jang and now giroo why is everyone getting so strange
boss
he's no boss he's a swindler and a crook
are you sure
i woke up and found out that he fled with everything
now i'm a total beggar because of him
i thought it was strange when he didn't talk
i should've investigated him who he was where he lived
but what now
i can't live in the village anymore
is there no place for me to work here
we're life buddies and crown prince is fond of you
there is an inn at the market
stay there i'll be there when i'm done with work
all right be sure to come
yes
if you betray me too i'm going to kill myself
all right
you're here
here
did you meet
what are you talking about
um i'd like to eat something
here for the time being
thanks
what's the matter what's wrong
nothing
brother
you're here
did you eat anything
you mean him
don't even mention he ate like a hog five bowls of kookbap
i was afraid that you might not come come inside
not this time please
welcome
do you have a quiet room
yes are you staying  yes
we have to clean this room will the ladies wait for a while
and will the men follow me
i'll be going now
where are you going
let's go catch that dirty bastard right away
i'll go find out so brother please stay here
perhaps
doham how did you get here
this voice
now that you're better off you don't want to be with me
how cruel how mean
my lady my lady
i have nothing to say
everything is my fault
and i do not know what to do with all you have suffered
run away with me now
i lost my father and my family was destroyed because of you
i have become a shameful exile but if you'd leave with me
we can both recover
anywhere in anything
if you have power you can recover
you should and you could
then i shall forgive the king forgive you and jang
i will forgive you all without any hatred
here now
you are where you should never be
but i will accept it as your final act of your past love
now if you'd accept my love nothing will matter
not love that crushes a man to death and betrays your country
but love that rebuilds me
and stands for silla
i love jang the baekjae man don't say it
love isn't so great as to throw away everything
love does not last forever
i who have been through all pain am willing to forgive you
it's almost pathetic
run away with me now
to japan to chunchook to soo leave with me
wait wait let me think for a while
the meeting will begin soon where's giroo
he hasn't been seen since yesterday perhaps something happened to him
no one saw him
something seemed to be going on i'll go and find him
whew there he comes
where have you been
eveyone's been waiting
hurry inside the meeting will soon begin
and when you're inside speak well of him
stay outside and wait i'll tell you to come in
me
i need you when i speak of doctor mokrasoo
you're here  yes
he is a doctor of haneuljae
he was hurt so his introduction was late
introduce yourself
i am giroo
well now that everyone's here we will begin
and as the prehead i will lead this meeting
yes do so
i have already considered to step down and
have also recommended doctor mok rasoo as head
this means that i will take responsibility for all the wrong doings
but what it really means
that doctor mok rasoo and i are not enemies
taehaksa is a place for studies not politics
we must use all our strength
in strenghtening baekjae
and doctor mok rasoo is fit for the role
does anyone have other ideas
then today's meeting will be closed
i have a different opinion
speak
come in
i am against doctor mok rasoo in becoming the head
the reason is because of this engineer jang
because of jang what do you mean
jang while we were all in silla
had an affair with a high rank woman of silla
so he fled with her during the night
the problem is that the doctor allowed it
giroo
so i am against doctor mok rasoo
becoming the head of taehaksa
in such a reality as this when baekjae kokuryo and silla are
against eachother i cannot understand how a taehaksa engineer
could run away with a silla woman and how doctor could
allow such an outrageous thing
that's not true
no it isn't
who are you
i am mojin and engineer who has been at haneuljae
with the doctor jang and giroo
how dare you come to a doctors' meeting
forgive my impudence
but when i saw giroo take jang here
i thought it was strange and so i followed
doctor giroo misunderstood
i know because i was the investigator of jang at haneuljae
the woman jang loved
was a baekjae woman who was taken to silla during war
jang tried to send her back to baekjae
and was followed by silla soldiers all the way to juneusung
and there he lead the war to victory
yes ms mojin's words are true
is what doctor giroo said true
is what he said true
is it true
i'll betray people if i can reach my goal
since when did we become different since when
since i saved your life
i don't want to be a princess
i don't want to be a silla's person
this is the end the last
i said not that one
i'll never forgive you
work area is soyundo
the area where murderers go
just abandon us
i'm going to clean my guilt i'm going to live and back
since everyone is here so i will start
i already resigned the master
moreover i recommended dr mok to be the next master
i diagree that dr mok should be the master
when we were in silla engineer jang
was seeing high calss woman
the problem is the flee was done under doctor's silence
so i here now disagree that
dr mok should be the master of taehaksa
is dr giroo saying the truth
is dr giroo saying the truth
i'm asking is it true
it's not true  no it's not true sir
i know it's not polite
but dr giroo brought jang with him to doctor's meeting
it was little awkward so i followed
dr giroo is misunderstanding
when i was in haneuljae
i was in charge of investigating jang so i know better
the woman who jang was seeing
is a baekjae person from war refugee
jang was trying to send her back to baekjae
during that he was chased by silla soldiers ended up castle
therefore he could have achieved huge merit in the war
yes engineer mojin is right
i cannot continue this meeting any more
yes
also i have to investigate about jang and dr mok
so both of you must not leave taehaksa
doctor how could giroo why did he
episode 22
why are you doing this i mean why
i don't have other reason
that's all i told you
but why now
why are you doing this when dr mok's about to be master
this is betrayal
betrayal what betrayal
betrayal of master betrayal of comrade
you don't know what betrayal is
giroo why are you doing this
if it was a problem
you should have talk to me and doctor
i have i have done it in haneuljae
i did it to you and doctor
i did it as it is meant to be
ok i got it
it's not a problem of me becoming the master
but your comrade jang
it all happened because of his love
can't you forgive that
can't you forgive him with pitieous feeling
that's why i can't forgive him
if everything is allowed because of love
there is no realism in this world
no country organization or rules
the love everyone insists to ignore everything
i cannot understand it
and don't you dare to speak betrayal to me
the reason why i didn't say about the suspicion of spy
it was my last obligation towards doctor
are you still waiting
no he was here
then he left to taehaksa in morning
he didn't look good although i was looking at him from far
i felt anger inside of him
i understand
his family and parents are ruined
will he be ok
find out
i heard taehaksa people go to market often
so find out how they're doing
as you told me to find a room other than motel
so i found it from private residence
yes we should go there
you've been standing too long princess
i'll bring some food to eat
to you do i look weird
please follow duke doham now
like he said what's great about me
i made the king and imperial like that
what is so great about me
why i ruined kim doham's family
so please now  but bomyung
his words are correct
but my body and heart won't do it
if i follow him now it's because i'm feeling sorry
do i have to follow him because i'm feeling sorry
should i
you shouldn't
as you're here so you should achieve with duke seodong
what
what sunhwa is missing
yes sir  find her now now
lord please leave her alone
what  a woman becoming a monk just
if so he's a baekjae person
even if she won't become a monk
i want her to be around my hands
she must have gone to taehaksa
send a couple of men to guard taehaksa
yes sir
if she has jewels
i gave it to bomyung
unless you're insane how can you do this
talk to me why have you done this
it's notjust being a master or not
things can go worse
right it's so sudden and absurd
we just envied it and let it pass by
is that what you think am i the only blame here
are you serious
if someone is in love
reckless behavior can be done
apart from that the general's people
are eager to get us and doctor
how can you do this
i've never thought i'm on side of
prince aja or general bu
why why do we have to be somebody's side
why do we have to brand as whose side
because of doctor
you are you serious
i'm on side of baekjae and i was telling the principle
you really are insane
bumro
i gotta beat the shit out of him
giroo i need to talk to you
let go
i thought you were little different mojin
you were in principle and fair so i thought you're different
am i really wrong here
love can rule out baekjae and rules
is this real image of taehaksa
so you had to put doctor and jang in danger
don't you know what you've done
if this is the only way i have to do this to fix it
giroo
i gotta talk to you  i don't have anything to talk about
no matter what i think i can't understand it
there must be other reason right
how's haneuljae people
they're scattered and talking
it's certain that something had happened
why aren't you investigating now
it's not questioning of military division
it's the questioning of taehaksa unlike military
so
if we investigate them now they'll be on mok's side
then
we should give time to giroo to gather his people
anyway things can turn out so funny
i'm going to see general now
you can't see him now
why not  a messenger from soo is here
to negotiate about papers
prince brought papers which was made from taehaksa
did he
it's not enough with the amount of gold last time
with a big flood in yangzu river all trees are swept away
you should pay 200 gold
no that's too cheap
then 250 gold
he calls 250 gold
no that's low as well
300 gold
he wants 300 gold
enough price is good
bring it in
this is the paper baekjae made
and 300 gold is the price we want
look at the quality of paper ink won't spread
the quality is different
i heard flood made soo very valuable of papers
so if you want we'd like to sell these
i could have called more price
but considering the relation i'll accept that much
with that quality soo is for sure
silla goguryu and japan we can sell it to them
so we need more production
executive you should make a big paper workshop
yes sir
it has to be enormous  yes
fatherinlaw do you know how important this is to us
of course
didn't general persuaded aristocrats like this
yes the profit from papers should be our power
we'll do our best to be your financial status
it's notjust financially
if a big workshop is made
we have to place soldiers to protect technique
right  and using that
we can raise soldiers legally
in order to do that you have to construct it
to avoid their eyes
go and get dr mok
yes sir
how did it go
finally it happened as aja wanted
we have to make a plan
even though excutive is the only one on prince's side
if one is turned over to them
this isn'tjust mok is becoming a master of taehaksa
if they start to pile wealth and soldiers
no way we have to find a way
the way seems to come
what are you talking about
interesting thing happened in taehaksa
what how how did that happened
i knew that already
but this would be the chance to sun
who did that who
his name is giroo
giroo  yes
he was the only one who was designated as doctor
i think he was confided from dr mok
so mok is betrayed by his disciple
yes
it's getting interesting
then investigate haneuljae people immediately
why did you come here
i think they're giving times make his sides
yes but they have strong bond
it'll be fun to watch
what kim doham said about me and seodong
yes
duke seodong what happened to him
i'm not sure but he didn't get caught yet
i got to meet kim send him a message
what would you do you have lost yourself
i have to beg i have to relieve his anger
it doesn't look it will work out
but i got to try anything
giroo
why you want to criticize me
ms mojin ordered gag our mouth
if you're questioned just say what ms mojin told you to
would you do it
what should i do
frankly i don't quite get you
do whatever you like i don't care
are you dr giroo  yes
someone wants you to
i'd like to see you there
giroo
giroo can we have a time to talk please
where are you going
i don't know he received a letter and took off
a letter  yes
from whom  no idea
no one knows him here
something happened coming back from hometown
princess
there
you shouldn't be seen
what's the reason giroo
come out now
if you come out now
what should i do duke doham
what should i do duke seodong
this was the last
it's over
it's all over now
this is the last
have you talked to him
just find out as much as you can
if he told about me this can't end queitly
find out find out  yes
why you didn't meet him
both of you where have you been
giroo come with me and jang follow dojang
what's going on  don't need to know follow me
doctor
i think they separate us and investigate haneuljae people
you all know why i gathered you
according to dr giroo
engineer jang was seeing silla woman
and dr mok connived two of them
is it true
is it true
it's not true
is it really not true  no it's not
you is it
of course it never happened
i don't know why giroo said that
it's absurd why has he done that
it is absurd to me
no it didn't happen
you don't even need to ask me
you is it ture  no it's not true
no  no
no it's not true
how dare you
i suspected and suspected
how dare you slander dr mok
immediately dismiss his position
and take him to imperial police
yes take him  yes sir
go and escort dr mok here
yes
please come out
haneuljae people witnessed that giroo was lying
please come out now
dr giroo must had anger inside you
your suspicion is resolved
so i'll make a day to discuss master
you don't need to go to taehaksa
why
fortunately all haneuljae people kept quiet
and they pretend it never happened
really  yes
please go to general
what you're going to jail
i'm very certain he wants to see me
please go there
was his name giroo  yes
bring him to my house
yes sir
this man kept insisiting that general wants to see him
was it to catch my eyes
it wasn't like that
but i knew it will result this
you knew that i will look for you
yes
do you have something to say
something you want from me
yes  what is it
crush silla for me
silla
and if you do that please let me take care of silla
take care of silla
if you do that i'll make you the emperor
how can i trust you
i'll show you from now on
haenuljae people kept quiet so nothing happened
it's so furtunate it's so fortunate
yes it is fortunate
how about duke doham is he ok
he's
why something happened
he got expelled and was taken to imperial police
what now he's in trouble
how how can this be happening
i caused all these what should i do
princess follow duke doham and leave
no what about duke seodong
although you're taken away from princess because of king's anger
but still you're the princess of silla
you have to follow obligation
i don't want to be a princess nor silla people either
i'm just a woman
why are you telling me to follow all those
don't you get it
can nobody understand what i'm doing
if it is you can leave leave
honestly i saw 3 guards of lord near taehaksa
i think they're looking for you
did you tell them where i'm staying
no i didn't
why not
because you haven't made any decisions yet
no matter what you decide i'll follow you princess
it's just that if you decide now you'll regret it
since you were young you were never influenced by situation
and you stood strong by yourself
i don't think it's time to decide yet
so step up by yourself
even if you see jang again
i believe you should look like that
isn't it true you caused accident
but why giroo has to be taken
jang is jang
then what about dr mok
whatever happens to him does it make sense
what happens who confessed the truth
but his behavior was too sudden
and his intention seems dishonest
dishonest giroo isn't wrong about one single word
jang set up ondol for silla people
his patrioticism is not enough
you you're funny how can't he be patriot
is it not
he cured king's disease and he fought in the battle for nation
just for these jang devoted more than giroo
it's strange that giroo suddenly betrayed
what betrayal
how is that betrayal how can it be
if it's not if it's not
why is it betrayal
what is it then say it properly
then jang betrayed us
jang made a mistake and it's not giroo's fault
if it wasn't jang
how could we be here  don't fight in my room
it's damn noisy
why does giroo have to cover jang's fault  get out
giroo betrayed us  then
then jang betrayed us  this isn't betrayal
it's jang's fault
damn noisy  shouldn't you admit that
didn't giroo betray us
then did jang betray us
for what reason i can stop woosoo
i also agreed with giroo how should i stop her
you're always clear about everything
but why are you so weak about jang
finally didn't jang make you suffer after all
didn't he make indelible stain in your life
abandon jang
no abandon yeon gamo
this is the last time
if this thing happens again i'll abandon you
the strength you struggled to gather i'll destroy it
don't think about that
it's easy for me to confess and leave taehaksa
but you doctor
that's not hard for me either
but the reason why giroo changed his mind
i'm really curious about that
me too
no i got to know that
have you found out
yes the biggest trade market of baekjae is sangdaepo
sangdaepo
but why did you
bomyung and chogi come in
are you prepared to leave
yes but where are we going
we're going to sangdaepo
po are we going to other country
princess but we don't even have id cards
we can't stay here any longer
and seochung is right
he's right
i'll stand on my own
there are a lot of trading merchants there
what's your plan
what is it
i'm the engineer of taehaksa
i need to see giroo who was taken to jail
not now
i won't take long
not now whether it's short or long
he got in yesterday and not a big felon so he has no penalty
i just need short moment
yesterday nobody came in yesterday
check the list giroo should be there
it's not here
he's not imperial police must have brought him here
so how can be not be here
did lock a person name giroo yesterday
giroo from taehaksa  yes
he was brought in but he was taken to general's house
what to general's house
are you the one who gave five colored necklace to my mom
do you know five colored necklace
i was told it was from my father
is he jang
why are you here
this is my house  what
i told you about my situation and you just ignored it
so i fixed it up
i'm sorry i was in panic
i whinged that i could work here
even he's histerical but he's got money
sopal sopal  yes here i am
i'm sweeping the front yard
who is he  yes he's my royal colleague
i told you last time
he i and other guy saved sir bu yeosun
really
you look very familiar
yes when i was in taehaksa i came here to deliver things
is that so  he's an engineer
sweep it now don't get me busted from madam
one of my colleague is in the house can you find out for me
alright just wait up
giroo
what happened are you alright
please this way sir it'll work out very neatly
right
giroo
is this why
you sold me and dr mok to gain this
to catch bu yeosun's eyes
yes
you fostered to disrupt haneuljae by fake arrest
yes  why
i told you the reason is just that
i don't acknowledge his and your way of thinking
i like general's way better
just as you think prince is your master
i found a master with my style
you told me this one day
are we the same type of person or not
if we met in different situation
would we be enemy or comrade
right we are enemies for real
because we're different
different
you abandoned and changed your goal because of love
i'll abandon and change my love because of goal
likewise
you abandoned and changed your goal because of people
i'll abandon and change people because of goal
isn't it enough reason to be the enemy
since when
since when we were so different
since when
since the day i saved you
if i abandoned you that day we weren't have this bad bonds
i regret it i regret this
for my goal and love i should've abandoned you resolutely
he can abandon people for the goal
the goal isn't obtained by people
you need to go to investigation room
doctor
giroo wasn't arrested he's on side of general
we can't even be enemy now
i hope that wasn't the one
i hoped that you didn't use
the heart of haneuljae people who cared about you
i will never forgive you
you used the trust of colleague
you answered the betrayal towards trust of people
i will never forgive you
transcendent person like you
you had greed to be the master
seeing that you didn't tell the truth
frankly when i ordered to arrest dr giroo
i thought you'd be the one to confess among those people
you always cared about hateful disciple
further i don't think you wouldn't care
when haneuljae people started to split
you disappointed me
these are statements from haneuljae members
will you still deny it
your positions in taehaksa are dismissed
i will designate you in imperial storage department
workplace is in soyeon island
soyen island
why what's it like there  i know
still it's official in division is it that bad
oh gosh
why what's it like in soyeon island
well pearl oyster and abalone is caught there
they can send them here as palace demands to
mineral is also plenty so they can send them too
there are many fish as well so they can send them here
then why other officials do those kind of things
right those kind of things are hard away from capital
what should we do about this
is there any way to stop this
pleaes talk to me what is that place
it's where murderers go
what
the labors there are murderers
s so
people die on the way to the island because of strong wind
the rest half will be beaten to death by slaves in island
those corpses will be buried in ocean
and you can't distinguish its bodies
by trepang and ascidian
what  are you serious
so it's not called soyeon island
people call it the island you will never come alive
murder island or skull island
gosh gosh how can jang
no
this is not true it doesn't make sense
was it you
what  the statements
i didn't do anything wrong the truth must be revealed
do you know what happened to dr mok and jang
they are going back to the island they will never come alive
are you a human you're not a human
if i didn't do so didn't giroo end up there
what's so bad that bad people go there
bad people why are they bad
jang caused this and he is a bastard
giroo only confessed what it happened
what you really
you're out of your mind
you guys what's the matter stop it
how could you do this
same here
cut it out cut it out
what's the matter with you
you guys really
is that true
it is i suspected and suspected
i hoped it wasn't true
i thought general tried to frame dr mok for some reasons
i thought so
but it's true i'm so disappointed jang as well
i feel the same
we should give them strong punishment
do you still believe them
what do you mean
mok rasoo hired that man
and overlooked an offense
mok's thought is exposed
but that happened in silla
it happened without a choice
then are you saying it shouldn't be a problem
you got to protect them with right moment
you tried to designate him as the master of taehaksa
and jang was designated and disorder confusion
this is your vision with people
why are you looking at one side they achieved bigger merits
jang has the merit of saving bu yeosun from war
and he's the man who leaded it to victory
but how can you talk about his royalty
because he was seeing a silla woman
and you suspect mok rasoo who covered it up
he solved the paper incident
and he worked things out divided taehaksa
what seems to be the problem here
that's why it's a problem
it can be disguised to execute those things
what
plus you'd know well how important it is
to secure the taehaksa
before unproven man can hold authority
we should cut its root
king said whoever talks about the past history
he'll assume them as disloyal
why are you mentioning about it again
if these men have no idea about this
that bronze incense could have been a problem
i said not to mention that again
also the man is not even 20 years old
and he did it because of his love
it's funny to discuss such thing
it's not like that lord
i told you to stop it  lord
stop can't you here
remove your order
what are you talking about
remove your order from jang and mok rasoo
how can you send them to soyeon island because of this
all investigations and punishments from taehaksa
is under my authority
you shouldn't be doing this
i know them better so remove your order immediately
are you position of prince
ordering me to remove my order
they violated the principle rules of taehaksa
and i ordered them as the master of taehaksa
so why do you use your power on right thing
your vision is dimmed by personal sympathy
isn't it right executive
this isn't easy as you think this is the problem of taehaksa
alright  of course
if we leave them like this our technique will be leaked
this must be the example of high security
yes but prince asked dr wooyoung to remove her order
i think he pressured her
what  is that true
i heard it
we have to tell aristocrats' point
since executive is the inlaw of lord you should be the guide
what do you mean
you want to save them by giving them our paper
they're going to soyeon island
i wouldn't know whether they come alive or not
please don't still this isn't right
fatherinlaw  paper can bring us huge benefit
and it'll make us to raise soldiers
how long have we waited for this chance to come
you should let mok and jang go this time
we can't afford to lose our chance because of that engineer
he's notjust an engineer
we acquired the paper because of them
if i abandon my people who do i have
it's time that prince ask me to exchange them with papers
he's still deciding sir
it's a give and go because of mok rasoo
but over all it's your dominant victory
i've never known
sudden appearance of dr giroo can work this out
i know he got rid of mok jang and even papers as well
but i don't like him
why are you afraid that he'll get my trust
that's harsh sir
i know he's too ambitious
yes
i don't like the fact that he betrayed mok rasoo
find out who his parents are
how he got into haneuljae
yes sir
prince prince don't do this
you seem you'll be released soon
what do you mean
prince will make you and jang stay
if he needs to hand the paper to general
so please don't worry
tell dalsol that i would like to see prince
pardon  now
yes
ask him  yes sir
sir prince is here
please let him in
prince
dr mok wants to see you for a minute
but he's not in situation to come to you
what is it
well someone wanted to see him
have a seat
prince  we're terribly sorry
did you call me to say that
no
then why did you want to see me
sir please let us go
yes you should abandon us
you should let us go this time
no i can lose everything but to have you with me
i know how can i not read your mind
wealth is not important to me
if you gain soldiers and strength from it
but what's the worth when you have nobody with you
i'm not asking to let go of papers because it's important
this is too obvious that it's our fault
whatever the perspective is it's our fault here
you shouldn't cover for us and it cannot be covered
if you protect this obvious mistake
the loyalty that you gained from people and officials
you will lose them all
as people are the power loyalty is the power as well
because you favor us you have to let us go
if you don't you'll lose your loyalty
and this will harrass you consistently
and we can't stay put in taehaksa
you'll lose papers too
so please swallow your tears and abandon us
then who do i trust to plow rough way
i'm very sorry
who do i trust along the way
lord
lord
again again do i have to be alone
lord we'll come back clean
we'll come back alive
lord
are you here to remove my order
if that's your order
no
what
taehaksa has its own rule
i cannot decide this with my personal emtion
as you ordered
send them to soyeon island
divest their positions and send them to soyeon island
what do we do what do i do
what do we do
he said to send them  yes
he's not exchanging papers with them
this is unexpected
i've never expected this either
now prince understands arm force and wealth are
more important than those engineers
i believed this will work out the paper case
it got pretty ugly
i'm terribly sorry to make you suffer
you met silla woman but i let you go
don't feel any guilt
by the way haneuljae people shouldn't be antagonized
i should say it to mojin and gomo before i leave
you two leave now
it's very dark
you have to leave now so you can make it ship
i wouldn't know when i can meet them
please allow me to say good bye
you don't need to leave now
come in
please escort them to workshop in soyeon island
yes ma'am
you sold me and dr mok to gain this
to catch bu yeosun's eyes
i like general's way better
i will never forgive you
you answered the betrayal towards trust of people
i will never forgive you
transcendent person like you
you had greed to be the master
your positions in taehaksa are dismissed
soyeon island
it's where murderers go
we should give them strong punishment
remove your order
this is your vision with people
it's time that prince ask me to exchange them with papers
abandon us please
yes you should abandon us
again again do i have to be alone
lord we'll come back clean we'll come back alive
divest their positions and send them to soyeon island
i'm terribly sorry to make you suffer
you met silla woman but i let you go
don't feel any guilt
you two leave now
it's very dark
you have to leave now so you can make it ship
i wouldn't know when i can meet them
please allow me to say good bye
you don't need to leave now
come in
please escort them to workshop in soyeon island
yes ma'am
episode 23

i have to hold haneuljae people from now
doctor's back wouldn't help anything
leave nothing behind
yes
jang jang  jang
has he gone really
how could she do this they might never come back again
they might die there she wouldn't let us have farewell
it's getting cold soon
i should have given them clothes i have made
jang
gloves i should've given him gloves
does it have to be like this
is this the only way to catch bu yeosun and dr wooyoung's eyes
is that what you think
do you think i used my master and colleague
to gain my desire for power
then what is it what's the reason of this
i went to haneuljae to revenge my parents' enemy
but the colleague who was in love with enemy and
doctor who acknowledged it i was suffered
it felt stronger after coming back from my hometown
i'm the one who is devastated here
nobody can even understand me i'm the victim here

yes it looks like merchant's house
you told it'll be alright what do we do now
are these people who designated to work in soyeon island
correct
you must got busted big time
anyway it's good let's go to owner's house
why there
i have to buy goods from sangdaepo and send to soyeon isaland
you taehaksa people would know goods pretty well
so buy them and get on the boat
come with me
your apprearance was quite unexpected
you resolved trouble some characters for me
let me ask you as man to man
mok rasoo raised you for 15 years
and jang was your colleague for 15 years
why did you betray them
i hate jang from bottom of my heart
bottom of your heart
i don't know between you two alright
it must be because of dr mok
when i was young
i and prince aja had royal education from dr mok
aja had everything of what emperor should have
he didn't like every bit of mine
the attitude what emperor should have
only inrresolution hypocrisy and pretense
sir general
i heard from dr wooyoung that you want to
deprive papers which was taken to jin's family
yes
there's a way
how
you can do what they've done
the same way
i arranged to construct a large workshop in invisible place
did you  yes it's only the beginning
with the advantage of paper on our hands
we have the advantage so we can start off something
as our strength gains
it's possible that suburban power come over to our side
it sure has to be i exchanged it with mok and jang
right we can do this
when it comes to talent dr mok and jang are the best
so we don't need to waste them
right right
dalsol dalsol
you heard him send a message to mok rasoo
yes sir
these officers are going to soyeon island when wind stops
show me what we were going to buy
yes this way
these are good quality please take your time
how do you end up going to soyeon island
where is the owner
why didn't he offer some liquor to soldiers
i'm very sorry he's little busy
come this way i'll get you nice food
i don't know who jin is
i don't know who the hell is jin gakyung and jina gunsoo
i'm not relevant
we didn't get lock up because of not identity
who is the merchant from soo jin gakyung who is it
i am
right
what's going on
some guys are trying to kill jin gakyung and jin gunsoo
for what  i've no idea
so i came to protect them
really so we can get out of here
yes my men are out there
so they will open the door secretly
we're saved
but where is sir jin gunsoo
i know they came with the same boat
why didn't he come together
he's in danger as well so i have to know where he is
where is he where is sir jin gunsoo
say it he saved our lives
yes ma'am
i'm jin gunsoo
what
you're all fake
he's father of jin gakyung and i know what he looks like
who are you people where are they
what are you doing
our identities will be exposed because of him
he'll be root of flame if we let him go
i'm not interested in your identities
instead i need to know where they are
ma'am  why are you looking for them
that's none of your business
if you don't tell me i can't tell you where they are
he's the enemy of my parents and family
the merchant of soo jin gunsoo confessed
that he secretly supplied weapons to my father
for that our family
were charged as treason and big nobles ripped us apart
i thought he died with peddle charge
but i recently found out that wasn't true
and i received information that he's coming in by boat
so i waited but jin wasn't seen
but his daguther you came out of nowhere
where are they
they died on the way to here on boat
what died
mysterious disease killed many people on the boat did they
i heard it
so we disguised their id cards
ma'am even if he's saying the truth
he knows our id cards are fake
ma'am
he must be the owner of this place
do you think we'll safely get out after killing him
i'll give you 1000 gold so let us go safely
guys  yes boss
these people got nothing to with it
take them out
come out
i'm sorry you're free to go
let's go
jang
captain  you're jang you're really here
what are you doing here cap

how did you
do you know him
yes doctor he put fire on the battle with me
really
this is dr mok of taehaksa
yes
don't stand here let's go in
please go in
do you happen to know people who just left
who  merchants of soo he means
merchants of soo  yes
why do you ask them let's go in
yes  this way
it's not right i have to see him again
i think so too
sopal said you took his money and fled
idiot i knew it
it's not true
he even took my money to gamble and lost all
so i got it all back  what
and i looked for him and he was gone
with your money his and mine
now i'm a big merchant
he doesn't even know that
and he's working as a servant
he deserves that leave him alone
boss jin gakyung wants to see you again
what does she want
i'm not sure but she got to see you
alright
i'll be back have some drinks first
please help yourself
yes
what's the matter
are you still afraid that i might reveal your identity
what is it
the promise is a promise
i promised 1000 gold if we go safely
if that makes you comfortable i'll take it
that will do more than 1000 gold
what is this
it's not stolen or any problem with it
but it's just one piece of our story
allow us
allow you
otherwise i have to get rid of you since you know us
move i got to see my lady
no back off
but i like you
i don't want to
you don't want to
if this is one piece of your story
you have a big story that i can't deal with
i got things to do and busy
i don't want to live with your load on me
then i have to kill you
if you want to
what should i do we showed him ourjewels
enough let's go
ma'am
ma'am
what did you do
is it going to be ok
he's not the type to talk
really we can trust him
anyway we must leave here quickly
no i will stay here so look for motel or house
you guys spread out and find out about him
about him  yes
what to soyeon island
yes it happened
soyeon island you can't go
you can't go to soyeon island
we're not going as criminals
at least we're officials there
what bad thing could happen
it's not like that
intact person gets dead if you go in there
i'd been there for a while
huh why
frankly my family used to have power in area of sangdaepo
i'm a son of yeon jungkwon
you're a son of sir yeon jungkwon
do you know my father
i don't know him personally
he was very close to executive and used to be dalsol as well
yes but the relation of executive became a problem
i was falsely charged and other family attacked us
really i've been away from baekjae so i've no idea about it
the reason you were called captain
one day i woke up and i'm a captain
anyway i was taken to soyeon island
but with help of my servants i safely get out of there
you mustn't go there
escape now
you must escape now
if we do we'll never go back to prince aja
yes we must bear everything and go back to prince
well that place is not like that
half of die on the way to the island
and rest half dies by sickness
you don't know what i'd been through don't go there
are you putting your life on the line again
if you don't want to escape i'll do something at the council
you're not going as criminal so you can stay there
i heard about some people doing that
why aren't in asleep and out here
i have a favor
i'm alright but you got to take jang out
jang has to live
what is that true
stay at the mulberry field near castle sabi
and wait for the order
yes i did so get ready and come out
soldiers are waiting outside
heaven's helping me heaven is  yes
if council won't release him i'd make him to run away
but a good news was waiting for us
yes but
what happened
it seems prince handed over the right of paper to get us out
this is another disloyalty
what's the matter with you
be happy you're saved and think what will happen next
if there's loyalty to do you can do it from now on
thank you for everything
you don't look good coming here far
and i'm going to trade in sabi very soon
i may supply goods to taehaksa so look after me
i can't put my hand on those procedure
doctor doc don't be too serious
no worries you don't have to help me
i'll do it with my own hands by that time
anyway tell sopal about this and wait for me
yes thanks
i see you again  yes
see you soon  yes
let's go
he accomplished big merit in the battle with silla
and he was rewarded 1000 gold
so he started off trade with that money
yes but his business skill is good
using time and price very appropriate
he made a lot of profit in every goods
have you got anything
he's gathering people who have their own stories
people with stories
yes people who couldn't pay tax escaped
he pays bail and bail him out
people who lent money from him and got bankrupt again
he lends them money again
really
if people are saying true
he'll be the merchant who can branch in castle sabi
what do you intend to do
buy what he's going to buy before hand
before hand
yes
boss it's strange
strange  all horsehairs are sold out
the ship came in not long ago why are they sold out already
i checked horsehair and i was looking for other stuffs
it's all sodl out so i can't say anything
it's him the merchant who brought horsehair
hey  yes
he's my boss  yes
have you sold all horsehairs already
yes when i took them out a woman came and bought it all
with good price too
this is cocoon what are we supposed to here
are you dr mok
yes  i'll deliver the order
the order
even baekjae has the history of making goods
we are unable to make silk fabric gold
right it's precious as gold that's why they call it gold
so the order is to make a loom to manufacture gold
but why is it not in taehaksa
there is secret workshop here follow me
they made a secret workshop while i was away
after all making pattern will depend on loom
so make it very quietly
by the way did the order come from prince aja
i don't know about that i was ordred to
make you focus on the experiment
this is obvious that prince tried to protect us
isn't it
instead of papers he will give in
he wants to make the pattern silk
yes it looks like it
we have to make it up to prince
yes we must
anyhow silk and silk fabric has the difference of weave
it is to modify the loom
yes i will ask officer to get engineer dolsye
although we have good idea
he's the one who will achieve it for real
alright let's do it
yes
prince is it because of dr mok and jang
i don't think i'm doing well
prince they asked for it
i know but
send one of your man to soyeon island
to soyeon island
yes see how they are doing and check if it's place to live
send man to check it
yes sir
and giroo how is he doing
each head workshop listen up
this is the storage list that dr mok organized
according to this in every workshop
there were serious material outflow
this is very serious crime
as much as method bribery
but i will cover it
i knew its management made you demotivated
so i will cover it up until today
but if it happens again after today
i will punish whoever commits this
return to your workshop and deliver my message
that is giroo
right he's doing good as much as doctor
righ right
i can do that with my feet
yeah i know
unskillful people are
better traitors right
traitor  let's go
how did you not know about this serious material outflow
or did you do it with them
i promised to cover it up
so please relieve your anger
method bribery and material outflow are caused
because all members of taehaksa lost
their motivation
so do you have an idea
yes not only reporting a book of inventing technique
it would be great if we use method of real name
method of real name
even if you roast a single tile
i thought about engraving the name on it
engraving the name
so all of us will have more responsibility and work hard on it
yes that's a good idea what about you guys
yes i think it's great idea
how about engineer gomo
yes i think it will motivate self pride and resonsibility
how about engineer mojin
that's wonderful idea
it's certain that dr mok raise disciples excellent
you and jang have the ability to grab people
why you don't want to hear about jang
no i have a favor to ask you
a favor
injustice must not be happened and it will gain your loyalty
so
please designate engineer mojin
as the master of engineers naesol
mojin
yes even dr mok follows her rules
she's very fair
nobody can do affair and management of taehaksa than her
but she's the closest to dr mok
that's why you have to do it
that will make you to lead haneuljae people
doctor always told me that haneuljae people
are his biggest strength
it's helpful to gain them instead abandon them
for the future of general bu yeogye
really really
we can really send some clothes to jang
yeah i heard so  who who did
are you guys ready
dad can we send anything to jang
i told you don't you know who i am
how how
you'd know shell of calm and abalone from soyeon island
come to taehaksa
so
what do you mean so
i asked asked and asked
so i met the guy who brings shells here
then do we have to give it to him
not that
so if we give it a guy who delivers here
that guy will deliver it to another who will go to sangdaepo
that another guy will meet the guy who goes into island
then he can load it on the boat
how do we go
what if someone steals it in the middle
what else do we have that's the only way
right let's send it in case
it took me long time to make this but what if it won't get to him
then you wanna give it to me
are you hurt
you can give all to me
are you going then i should go with
dalsol is sending his man so if you have anything to send him
really really
he will leave after dinner get ready
it turned out great
engineer mojin
dr wooyoung is calling you
dr wooyoung
come quickly
shorty with round face
why is she calling people to go and come
hey she's imperial family imperial family
don't say too directly you know round
you gotta say she's long and pretty like cucumber or eggplant
let's go and check if we have more things to give
let's go and check
what's the difference when giroo does it or dr mok
he looks he's doing it fine
everyone thinks the same
giroo has more talent than jang
is that why
taehaksa people are trying to be nice to me recently
that's right
how nice of you guys how nice
what
are you traitor supportors who support the traitor
you
are you cursing us
yes i'm cursing you bitch
what bitch you little
right you traitors
why there are so many flies in winter
i got to shake them off
i designate you to naesol
but i was away from taehaksa for long
your talent experience are qualified than anyone in taehaksa
you're going to be handed over today
who is the traitor between us
we're haneuljae people nobody's traitor
you idiots get off
you idiots i will tear you people apart for real
i thought you can do chicken fight but this is a dog fight
did you hear it  what what
well ms mojin became the naesol of taehaksa
naesol of taehaksa
the rumor said dr giroo recommended her
what
you talked trash but your mom got the most benefit
that's impossible
mother this isn't true are you a naesol
perhaps perhaps
it's true well done
nonsense say you can't do it say you don't wanna do it
i must follow the order i do not make choices
then what was your action towards dr mok
was it this light
go and say you're not taking this otherwise i won't see you
eunjin  eunjin
it's good they are gone and
we gotta live  live live
why did you do this
you'll do the best
and certainly you're the best so i recommended
please think it carefully
to stand up taehaksa
is it really betrayal for dr mok
is it really betrayal for baekjae
eunjin where are you going
i'm not sharing room with you i'm using with other person
eunjin this isn't a simple thing
it can be better for doctor when i take care of here well
i don't know i just don't like it at all
it doesn't make sense
i don't get why he told that jang was seeing silla woman
and taking care of here when doctor's not here
and i don't understand you doing theirjob under them
whatever happened we'd lived for 15 years
either we like or not we have to on the same side
i don't get it people got so weird after coming here
only doctor and jang got miserable
isn't pattern leaving the weft and
change weave of the warp thread
yes it depends how warp threads stand out in relief
it becomes pattern and rest is to copy
the loom weaving plain fabric has
only one wrap tie to lift up the warp thread
so a single line pattern needs one wrap tie to make one
if so to make various patterns
don't we just make several wrap ties
it is theoratically making several wrap ties
can you structure it  yes
they're doing it best without knowing anything
they think aja took them out of there
anyway they hardly sleep and work
even mok rasoo is not well he's working hard for it
so good news will come soon
yes if it does happen
i can pay back the paper thing greatly
anyway giroo is the treasure to us treasure
yes he's doing great in taehaksa
so i don't have to worry about anything
are you dr giroo
what is it  i guard the gate
somone came to see you urgently
who is it  well you have to see him
father  doham
father you're alive  yes yes
father
we shouldn't be out here
yes please this way
i thought giroo's father was dead
it's ok ok  father
i came back alive  father
i only thought of you
and came back from dead
i knew you'd be here
how's your body are you sick anywhere
i'm alright
don't worry anything from now on
i told goosan to get a house so you can stay there
alright alright
no matter what i will set things again
don't worry
yes doham i believe in you
by the way i heard princess sunhwa is missing
didn't she come here
where the heck is licorice  it's all sold out
didn't you always trade with us
how come you didn't talk us and sold everything
she got me good price and i'll sell you next time
it's already fourth
find out where they are  yes
what are you gonna do with all these
are you trying to do business here
if it's not good i will sell it
then what is good
you're late than i thought
if you can't allow me with my story how about my talent
this will surely show my wealth
i got information and bought things early am i not qualified
i won't be your burden
i heard that you will open a shop in castle sabi
i won't be your loss but strength
if i get in danger because of your history
i will abandon you without hesitation
that's the same here
your background didn't look so small
do you need fake identity
or do you need to be a wealthy merchant
disguised identity is more valuable
alright then you can be on top of me
now you're the man behind the scene
what you invented it
they really made device
they haven't experiment it yet
but the officer said it looks it will work
yes yes that is mok rasoo
that is jang
yes they must have put their lives on it
yes i'm sure they have
now you can send them back to soyeon island
yes i can take them out when i need them
anyway it got very interesting
when they realized that it was for me not aja's
i want to see their faces
and aja's face as well
what mok and jang aren't in the island
yes prince they haven't arrived there yet
if they if
where did you send them to
what are you talking about
where did you send mok and jang they're not in soyeon
yes we needed a crucial development
so i sent them there first
a crcucial development
i thought you'd like it very much
if it gets little delayed
that wasn't true was it
this will work
yes 3 of us thought about this it will work fine
to make complicated patterns we need tens of wrap ties
look over there
since we made many wrap ties
device won't have strength so we made hwaroo
a person needs to go up there and lift threads
yes so people down here weave as they did
and a person up there control threads
then complicated pattern can be produced
please do it give it a try now
yes
what happened to them
it is ominous it seems ominous
it's done
it's true it's done
now we can produce silk fabric with pattern
yes we don't need to import it from soo any more
yes now we can make it with our hands
please let prince aja know this
he'll be very pleased
yes i'm pleased very pleased
i'm so pleased that you strained aja's neck with your hands
what are you talking about we strain prince's neck
mok has been away so long so you don't know anything
we have all rights of pattern fabric gold
so i don't need to steal the paper now
he cheated us
jang
now it's the same situation with castle chunwie incident
you have trusted that prince aja can be your strength
but he cannot be
i will ask you again will you obey me as your master
if you do you will go back to taehaksa
if not you're going to soyeon island
i'll give a day
if you don't want drive jang to death think carefully dr mok
aja is not your only disciple mok rasoo
you got to listen to me once
i can't rest here
i got to find out
crown prince king asks you to come to his palace
king's palace
lord
what is it
lord you'll be pleased
i bu yeosun brought great news
since baekjae couldn't make the silk fabric
we imported it from soo with expensive golds
right it costs as much as gold that's why it's called gold
yes but now baekjae can produce that gold
is this true  yes lord
this is true
yes compare to soo's this is great quality
this is brillian achievement after papers
that is correct well done well done
it was very refreshing to see soo with paper case
but it's pattern silk fabric this time
yes silk is incomparable to papers
this will save up the gold
we have to give them
so i would like to supervise the messengers this time
may i do so
yes you may
yes please prepare for it
of course
silk
did mok rasoo and jang develop it
it looks like it i wouldn't know about taehaksa's work
shall we
what should we do about this
we were happy to gain papers but fabrics were taken
prince we must have a plan
doctor and jang was used find where they are
yes sir
if you don't want drive jang to death think carefully dr mok
we drove prince to critical situation
what are we supposed to do what are we supposed to do
one day has passed
will you obey me
i asked you to be submitted
i won't submit to you rather you will submit to me
what how dare you say that shit
i will make you to submit to me general
are you merchant from soo
i'm jin gakyung from soo
you're all fake
allow us
do you happen to know people who just left
merchants of soo he means
i have a favor you got to take jang out
i'll read you the order you are asked
to make a loom to manufacture gold
this is obvious that prince tried to protect us
they think aja took them out of there
isn't pattern leaving the weft and
change weave of the warp thread
if so to make various patterns
don't we just make several wrap ties
i'm so pleased that you strained aja's neck with your hands
lord you'll be pleased we can produce gold
this is brillian achievement after papers
i would like to supervise the messengers this time
we drove prince to critical situation what are we supposed to do
what are we supposed to do
it seems like they're in mulberry field
where belongs to hae doju
does it  yes
general visited there in the morning
really
are you merchant from soo
i'm jin gakyung from soo
you're all fake
allow us
do you happen to know people who just left
merchants of soo he means
i have a favor you got to take jang out
i'll read you the order you are asked
to make a loom to manufacture gold
this is obvious that prince tried to protect us
they think aja took them out of there
isn't pattern leaving the weft and
change weave of the warp thread
if so to make various patterns
don't we just make several wrap ties
i'm so pleased that you strained aja's neck with your hands

episode 24
one day is passed
will you obey my order
i asked you will obey me
i will be indomittable i will sumbit you to me instead
what how dare you say that shit
i will make you to submit to me general
i like your unlimited arrogance and obstinacy
dr mok rasoo
jang seems to resemble me instead of prince
soldiers  yes sir
take these two to soyeon island
yes sir
whenever you change your mind
tell these soldiers i will put you right back here
do we have to stay in soyeon island
it's direct order from general
get a motel in sangdaepo
and change the shift in every forenight
yes  unless they beg you
don't allow anything
where are dr mok and jang
they accomplished their mission so they must be gone
do i have to know where engineers are
the reason why you couldn't be crown prince
do you only think because your father's not the king
no you don't have the character of prince
to use and take care of people
what can you do except fraud and threatening people
although you have 1000 of strength and 10000 swords
that's the reason why you can't be the one
even if you have dignity and lineage
if you can't have 1000 strength and 10000 swords
that will be the reason why you have to step down
to realize your capacity and decide to step back
it's the basic of great character
crown prince
if you don't want drive jang to death think carefully dr mok
it's not long since they had left
but they came back again
they seem they brought the result
yes lord it looks like it
diplomacy doesn't go around with pressure
prince control them well and work out the fabric case
but lord
why
bu yeosun achieved this fabrics
therefore it'd be nice if he leads in negotiatoin
yes lord i won't disappoint you
i let you do that
i trust you will have the same result as prince
yes lord
it's very important today
today's negotiation is important
you must retrieve the paper case
i will
if this is rejected our situation gets very difficult
fabric will work things out we can claim more gold for it
are you alright we can delay this and let you rest
i can't do that this time
sir are you alright
he came a long way that's why
i'm fine  yes
what's your response about the paper
i will take it from now on
yes
emperor like the quality of paper
and allowed to import it
i appreicate for his kindness
instead we have to be paid with right price of silk fabric
right price
the fabric got improved constantly
but the price is the same with 5 years ago
you need to start talking soon
good let's negotiate
for thanking the paper very nicely
i'd like to give present to emperor
present
yes bring it in
baekjae made this pattern fabric with its device for the first time
then baekjae invented fabric device
that's right the first fabric baekjae made
i would like to give a gift to the emperor
what about negotiation on silk fabric
if it's better than ours you will pay the right amount
if not soo must pay us
the right amount don't you
so please hand it in to the emperor
you had to see the right moment
prince i will do this by myself
with that pattern fabric soo is certain
other countries would want it
of course
a lot of quantity would be needed
soon make a large workshop for it  yes
and messengers wouldn't be ease now
so prepare precious things for their individual gifts
and dinner should be the greatest
yes sir
yes
we had more profit from fabrics than papers
that's correct
they took the right of paper
they're trying to take the right of fabric
we can't say anything for what we have done the same
it got worse than taking papers
but that's not the problem now
what do you mean
messengers of soo wouldn't go back quietly
i feel unease
this is a problem
i know
what do we do about this
i'm having headache headache
we tried to secure gold using pattern fabric
but that won't be possible now
they must have developed where they had no improvement
we have to turn things around this situation
otherwise we'll be the blame
anyway we have to secure the same amount of last time
we have to get something anything to blemish
dinner is ready please come out
alright
bring it
it's really nothing but please accept it
start the party
yes
please start
you must be little displeased
crown prince is doing well in diplomatic politics
but he was doing his best on japan
and i know soo was quite disappointed of him
you must heard from goguryu
he's talking about myunggwanggae
goguryu kept pressuring us to make them
but i refused it to the end
then baekjae didn't make it for them
we developed it but didn't give them goguryu gave it to silla
unlike prince i think about soo first
other than goguryu silla and japan
especially goguryu requested many things
because of war with soo
and we could have sold more weapons
but i thought the loyalty with soo is more important
what is it
sir this is the special deer meat for healthy food
deer meat strenghtens engergy and it's very good for liver
it turns back a weak person to normal health status
so it's great for fatigue of travel
aren't these gold
yes it helps blood circulation and good taste of food
please have them
yes please
this is famous baekjae hansansogok liqour

i know a place here let me get some medicine
how do i trust you
i'm not trying to run you can come with me
it's nearly time to depart
things can go worse if he boards on the boat now
so let me treat him now
what treatment for criminal
look do you know the big merchant's house here
yes why
i don't have time so can you deliver my message to him
everyone can buy it so just wait
can all of us really buy
yes you can
i can't believe that
why is this place so prosperous
well i have no idea
they take all valuable things coming in sangdaepo
i heard a merchant from soo looking after owner
that was true
what
the celestial woman from soo is
now the owner of this place
yes  pretty like celestial
she's damn pretty  really
let's do business here often
business is very active
she bought everything why wouldn't it be active
right
i heard you're gathering people with histories
where did you hear that
did you think my lady wouldn't do any work on you
people who didn't pay tax bankrupt people
even murderers you're allowing those
well you need all kinds of people in business
can't you let me use them
that won't be a problem but what are you trying to do
i want to try different method of business
different method
i need people with heavy mouth and patience
a message is delivered  a message
the comrade from chunwie battle
he's in sangdaepo
what sangdaepo
why are they back here again
he has rigor and fever stomache for sides
he wanted medicine immediately
yeah i see
prepare it  yes
then
he achieved merit in the chunwie battle
that wasn't a lie
chunwie chunwie
duke seodong was there i think
look when does the boat depart to soyeon island
soyeon it already departed
what when
that boat is going to soyeon island
doctor doctor
fever is getting worse you'll lose your conciousness
i'm fine i can bear this
look here he's really sick
doctor doctor
doctor doctor
turn the boat otherwise doctor will die
what we feel hell for nausea
please turn it back now
doctor doctor
give me some water water
can't you be quiet if you keep talking
i will throw you into the ocean
doctor
you must rest
i'll just greet them and rest
it won't be late after you rest
are you from taehaksa
yes
is he having seasickness
he wasn't well before he got on boat
show us where he can rest first
doctor doctor
what's this isn't it virus  doctor
doctor doctor
i need water where is medicine please show me
hey take him  yes
doctor doctor
what's this am i treating him here
this is it how do i know it's seasickness or virus
it's nothing like that he had rigor and fevor from the town
don't tell me his symptoms we ain't got a doctor here
what  this place is for murderers only
why would doctors need for
i just separate them to stop spreading any disease
but he's here as an official
he must have committed something
anyway doctor is not here
look you're here as official you don't have any medicine
we're not sick we just have wound and fracture
how can they leave us like this we're just waiting to die
i broke my arm
doctor doctor
patients' sicknesses aren't that serious
they can be cured with medicines
if you leave them disease will be born and spread
they are gonna die anyway
are you saying you'll let them die
i committed crime and ended up here what power do i have
then send me to sangdaepo at the next arrival
let me just get medicines i can't leave doctor like that
would they let you do that
it's not a place to live here
i think so it looks like i'm going to die here
when's the next boat coming in
i have a favor i need to go to sangdaepo
here it is again
if i can't go ask someone to
bring some medicines  no
all people can be saved if we have medicines
i know the prescription i will write them down
i said no
unless you will surrender to general
nothing is possible
surrender my ass get some medicines people are dying
where are you going  let me go let go
stay still
let it go  no
stay still  let go let me go
what a nonsense
look at this this here is the evidence
am i still lying here
this silver spoon proves it all how can you be evasive
that's not possible
we put the silver spoon in wang's food
this is the evidence that baekjae poisoned
a messengers with letter of the emperor
i will report this to the mainland
what did you do with the food after he collapsed
i was dealing with him
i couldn't pay attention on his food
damn it damn
how should we deal with it
if imperial of soo finds out about this this is crisis
we will find out the truth the truth
would it be ok  don't worry
couldn't they find out
even if they find out there's no way to prove it
dead man is dead and we have to achieve our purpose
diplomacy is a war without weapon
before we achieve it we can't go back
if prince did it it wouldn't happen
are you trying to blame someone without a solution
i'm saying because we don't have a solution
stop now
i will prove his natural death
no give up the pattern fabric
to protect that we can lose bigger one
you would know it's their intrigue prince
i was on charge of it and i'll be responsible for it
here it is please check it
taehaksa needs to reveal his natural death
i heard poison was found by a silver spoon
they must have used it after his death
servant said he had sickness since he got here
there must be a way find it
yes sir dr giroo gulchi gomo and i will take this
i see there's no time  yes
if dr mok was here
we'd find the easier way
it won't be hard
i heard poison death will leave evidence in dead body
see heaven is not heartless
what do you mean
this is happening becauase they kicked out jang and doctor
you shouldn't say that
this is the matter of baekjae
what a patriot you are i'm not like you
whatever it is with general and
wooyoung or woo something
if you keep saying that
you can be disappeared silently
whatever did i say something wrong
just watch your mouth storm is begun in the palace
but is there a way
what solution jang has to be here
we have dr giroo
he will get it  how
gold powder has no significance in human body
deer was caught on that day so meat was fresh
then what's the problem
it's not a problem didn't they add poison in the food later
right so we have to find out
what cause him to die
or either he didn't die of poison
you can tell from the corpse
poison burns the tongue first if it is the cause of death
really poison burns the tongue first
then
we have to see the dead boy first
i thought so too
what if they fabricated the body afterward
there's nothing we can do
doctor would have done wise decision
how he might be in the rough area
you have to be concious you can't die
without applying any medicine
tell me anything anything i can use it for medicine
look for pokeroot around here
pokeroot i will look for it just hold on tight
this is boiled water of pokeroot
you have to drink this you got to drink this
go and
find potentilla kleiniana and bridal wreath
you got to take care yourself first
he looks he has a boil and that guy has malaria
if you leave them they will die
why aren't they coming
right it's already passed the shift day
huh what the heck
you're not a human can't you see people dying here
how can you just watch them dying
if you want to save the doctor you change your mind
what's worth more than a life it's simple
i'll obey you general
your one letter will save doctor don't you want it
captain
captain
why are you so late i was waiting for you so badly
we have emergency situation we were damn busy too
why  the messengers from soo
one of them died and general was driven to a corner
really  you know general
invented the pattern fabric or something
and showed to them
they must have felt bad
and one of them died fortunately
so they insist general killed the man with poision
is that true  yes
they will cut trade with us
and within soldiers general may be taken to soo
he might get punished all kinds of rumors are going around
go back safely  alright
this place is like hell
what is it
deliver the letter to general please
now you're talking you got your brain working
alright i just need to deliver this
yes  take care of yourself
dig up the body
killing him wasn't enough and you want to dig up his body
it's not digging up just to find out what caused him death
the cause of death is proven clearly it's poisoning
go and tell king to elucidate this incident
if you keep avoiding its cause
we'll stop the trade and other method will be handled
find out where they hid the body
place they hid
we need to even steal it to prove its cause
it can be much more seirous if it turns other way
nothing gets worse if i sit and watch this
i have to let go of everything
jang sent a letter
yeah he couldn't stand for long
mok rasoo is sick and i think it's serious
finally mok rasoo is helping
let me see
i heard you're in difficult situation
nobody can figure it out
bring me to castle sabi i'll work things out for you
perhaps if you think i'm doing it
because of dr mok's sickness it doesn't bother me
but it's your fault think carefully
who put fire penetrated silla soldiers
and who found out about the ex king's head
what's wrong it's not about obeying you
when begging won't do any good you threaten me
what is it
you got to give up the fabric
if you had to give valuable things you got to calm them down
soo is the big nation
if the relationship gets worse it won't be good for baekjae
i do know that
is it because of competing power with prince
this isn'tjust competing power
all nobles are watching me how i work things out
i'm taking care of most of nobles
but nobody knows who they will support at the last
plus they always think about my identity
that i'm not the prince
i've always been doing things as if i was testifying
so i achieved this much
far distant soo
and close nobles i can't give them up
so you must help me
find the remote evidence
the evidence which can turn things around
to conceal the poisoning you stole the body
the man who has the letter of the soo's emperor
don't you know the man represents the emperor
elucidate now
what is the reason of doing this
no this is general's individual action
to prove the cause of death
imperial never decided to do this it's misunderstanding
i can't believe this this is important matter of nation
how can one general can decide on its decision
i'll go back and report this to emperor
he has the absolute trust from emperor
i can't let him leave like this
prince don't make them leave
yes lord
how could general do things like this
without my permission
yes he doesn't know basic of diplomacy
bring mok rasoo and jang back here
the letter was sent because of mok rasoo
you never know what he might have
the turtle slander and the king's head case
and fire steeple as well
i know his words are rude but he will work things out
means he will help you
he doesn't want to surrender so he's looking for the excuse
if it is not true we can get rid of him for its cause
he is back from the hell
since he's doing this he must have an idea
we have nothing to lose
bring him back
yes
you are ordered to come to castle sabi
what are you talking about
the order came in after receiving jang's letter
jang what happnened
he can't walk so take him by a stretcher
before boat gets off we have to hurry
jang
guys  yes
prepare stretcher  yes
jang
you have just received silver
whether it's 5 or 10 years from now on
i'll be responsible for your identity and living
and your family as well
instead spread out and search the vein of gold
did you just say vein of gold
yes do complete search where gold is around
it doesn't have to be gold any mineral are good
pursue rumor or person you gotta find a new mine
the most important thing is the trust and security
like i kept your histories sealed
you have to be absolutely quiet about this
as soon as you're looking for the gold
our mission is blown up in the air got it
yes
then steward will group them
and tell areas and information where they are going
yes
have they departed
steward is wrapping up and they will leave next morning
thank you for allowing my purpose
i did but it's too big gamble
you're spending a lot
what if you don't find gold mine
they will find something if not gold
if not any mineral they will get good information
people found precious things when it meant to be gold
so this is not a gamble
why are you trying to draw things so big
huh
aren't you a fugitive
but i don't understand why you're doing this
yet i don't understand either
but it will help him one day
were you waiting for me
yes you have no time you were asked to come by horse
really
hurry get on the horse
he's unconcious what horse
what what the heck do you want
i'm not going until he gets medicine
i won't move one single step
you little shit
give him this  what's this
honestly when we got on this boat
that merchant gave me this medicine to you
why are you telling me now
it's our order not to do anything for you
i only followed my order
doctor is not going castle sabi
what he's not
doctor needs to rest here i'm going alone
you can't do that
if you want to kill me kill me i can't go like this
you got to rest here doctor i'll go by myself
i need to go with you

it's fortunate i was worried that you were taken to the island
i need to move the doctor first
please take him to room
please lay down

this is nothing to me
doctor please take care of yourself

other man takes care of these precious things
i'll see what i can do it has to be quiet right
please help yourself

prince begged us to wait and that's all you are saying
then what do you want
we want only one give me the reason why you killed them

episode 25
let's go
jang
crown prince  jang why are you doing this
i know your anger towards sun
this is a matter of baekjae
you shouldn't do this
i also know what you mean
but this is a matter with general
jang
you must get your hand off this
and entrust everything to general
and please pretend you know nothing about this
i'll take care of everything so please don't worry
he is totally impudent
who does he think he's ordering to
but if he has a strategy
what about dr mok
how come dr mok didn't come with jang
yes why isn't he here
he was very sick to come this far
something could have happened if he did
so i had to treat him in merchant's house in sangdaepo
what  but soldiers are with him
as soon as he recovers bring him back
then you knew how he sick was
and you trusted jang
there isn't any jang has no plan
he's just trying to buy some time for dr mok to recover
he must have thought of hiding doctor somewhere
go and get mok rasoo
send a message now
yes sir let's go
he knows his life is on the line if he has no plan
did he really do it for mok rasoo
jang would do it
if he decide to save him he doesn't think of himself
we'll find out if we bring dr mok
how are messengers doing
they may be waiting orders from mainland no movement
general use goguryu
send a message to goguryu to visit us
they can't do anything while goguryu messengers are here
but the relationship with goguryu is harder than soo
prince is still working on it
surely it's that woman
without him i can't smile or be happy or sad
why should i do that
where are you going
i need to do my business
bring him back  alright come
they guard him whole time what should i do
find a way
is the woman really merchant from soo
yes why do you ask
then is she here as a guest
no she's traded with us for a few years

we shouldn't be doing this let's look for him
yeah let's hurry
what has happened  boss boss
boss
what happened why are you alone without doctor
he was caught on the street
what
what is it that you panic
a friend of mine ask me to look after a doctor from taehaksa
i couldn't keep his promise
a doctor from taehaksa
do you know him
he wanted to see you when you come back
why dr mok want to see ms jin
did you say dr mok rasoo
do you know him  yes
then the person asked you to
the friend from chunwie of name is
jang
jang
do you know him  yes i do
how do you know him
what kind of danger is he in
i have to go to castle sabi
soldiers are gathered to protect market i'm busy with that
i'll go with you
come out
talk to him
talk about what
your strategy
do your part first
bring him in
doctor  jang
you talk about power to test me
it's funny
if you have a strategy tell me now
otherwise he won't be alive
doctor i'm sorry
whatever happens to him i'll do this my way this time
i didn't know you'd do this
i've never known that you would bring him by force
who is suffering from pain
i'm truly disappointed
sir general i will change my proposal
reinstate of taehaksa isn't enough now
if you want to know my strategy
you have to add the merit we achieved
and confer me as an engineer
and confer dr mok as the master of taehaksa
this is my new proposal
jang  moreoever
our designation must be held first
otherwise i won't say a thing
either you kill me or not it's your call now general
you're doing this to save me but you don't have a clue
jang
now my life and your life are on the line
don't i have to think anything
how reckless are you
don't worry doctor trust me
the woman you aparted in silla
yeah
how did you end up having farewell
you couldn't win over the hierarchy
no she was very high class
finally she was caught by bodyguards
but why do you ask now
have you met her again
how can i meet her when she is left in silla
if she's not here to see jang
why did she disguise herself as a merchant
so jang told general that he has an idea
and he got into palace
yes
he tried to burden it himself and asked me to take care of him
and i was so loose gosh
you got to find out something now seochung
yes
i thought jang would listen to us when mok is brought here
but he ended up rebelling
it seems he really has the strategy
what do you think
i do not agree with it
it happened anyway and he's trying to buy some time
so now is  general
what do you want
messengers want to see you
they do
message arrived from the nation
to kill the messenger with letter of emperor
is insulting him and he was very furious
considering the relation with baekjae we won't cut off the trade
so hand over the gubong mine to soo
what  what did you say
or i was ordered to bring
general who is responsible for this incident
what
we're leaving 3 days later decide until morning of the day
whether you come with us or hand in gubong mine
gubong mine
is soo confiscating the land of baekjae
this is total nonsense
this must not happen in history of baekjae
but if we don't accept it
general will be taken with all responsibility
we wouldn't know what will happen
i've seen plenty of this
unfair diplomacy enough
then are you saying we should hand over the gold mine
anyway we mustn't let general to be taken away
we have to stop it
this is very intolerable
it's not somewhere it's gubong mine
that's the biggest gold mine in baekjae
right this isn't a small issue
it's the demand of big nation we can't do anything
are you saying we should hand over the general
that's why i'm discussing
so when prince asked to do fabrics little slowly
it would have never happened to us
why is it sun's fault
this is the problem they disguised the death
isn't that diplomacy
it is common that messenger gets died on travelling far
every time it happens with bad mutual countries
this kind of problem always have caused
that's why prince always took care of messengers first
and negotiation comes afterward
plus you could let prince to take care of it
but you stole the body and it got worse and worse
what are you trying to say
are you saying general has to be fully responsible
it's not whose responsibility now
to be confiscated the mine is not only matter of loss
it's directly related to the pride of baekjae
i cannot agree with that
what are you saying that we have to send the general
all of you do you think the same
other nations can't give up their pride and benefit
that's why they send a hostage
what
it's not too late
you can tell them that we'll support weapons to goguryu
we can go from there
prince aja always have insisted it with relation of soo
when we deal with the mainland
it is much lucrative for 3 of us to show unity
but baekjae and goguryu have been enemy for so long
prince aja has been suggesting it
and that's why most of nobles don't support him
that my brother can't do this
but this isn't the ordinary situation
even if he does soo won't buy it
we have to make them to
diplomacy is how much you make them trust
and cheat each other
using goguryu is the brilliant move
why do you hesitate
aren't you baekjae person
the relationship between baekjae and goguryu
is much difficult than baekjae and silla
if he makes a wrong move he will be on the edge
but if we work things out as jang said
general's position will never be expanded
rather it extens prince's influence
i know enemies are all over us
you can't get what you want without listening to my plan
how could i not put my life here and come this far
you said you don't need to keep weak person's promise
my strategy is my strength
now i'm in control what will you do
you can slash me with a sword
but you can't get out of this hell general
hand over the gubong mine
or the general has to be taken to soo
gubong mine
now general is in the corner
then he can go to soo
do you think you'll safe after all
even if i'm not i gotta win this time
unless you keep your promise fisn't
i won't say a thing from my mouth
how can't you distinguish national and personal matter
i will do it tomorrow
tomorrow i will appoint
you and mok's designation
tomorrow really
so tonight
open the board of doctor officially
do you really trust jang has the strategy
yes
i thought he did it to save mok in the first place
but i put mok's life on the line but he wasn't moved
he won't put his life on risk to just piss me off
he has the strong will to survive
and that's why he made it through the steeple
it was the same eyes when he had at the fire steeple
maybe maybe he used that
here you are
where have you been
i sent goosan to silla
why
i can't hide to live
i got to bring my assets which i can
yes i have an idea of myself
ok by the way didn't general's case solve yet
finally he accepted jang's proposal
dr mok will be designated as the master tomorrow
what
doesn't dr wooyoung designate as the master
i thought it was but what's this designation
right this is too sudden
people are in panic because of the messengers
i have no idea what is happening
i thought jang is here but he's not around
what happened
i don't know i saw him maybe not
that's surely i might not saw
how how  what what
who is that look
it's jang it's jang
jang
attention
neverthless dr mok rasoo and engineer jang
were demoted regarding their behavior in silla
they invented loom device to produce pattern fabric
they achieved high honor of baekjae
therefore i absolved their sin from silla
engineer trainer jang to engineer
dr mok rasoo is to the master of taehaksa
the board of doctor has decided yesterday
dr mok and engineer jang stand in front of prince
come forward dr mok
the imperial of baekjae achknowledge your merit
so i designate you as the master of taehaksa
come forward engineer jang
the imperial of baekjae achknowledge your merit
so i designate you as the engineer of taehaksa
jang  jang
what happened how did this happen
i heard you were in the palace but you weren't around
i was so worried
jang
now i kept your promise let's go to general
time hasn't come yet
also i haven't seen my colleagues for long time
so i have to enjoy myself
and i need to be congratulated for becoming an engineer
please wait let's go
sir please drink a lot  alright alright
how did this happen and what's that promise
it's nothing how have you been
haneuljae people are divided in half because of giroo
and general got punished from heaven so he's in trouble
he tried to prove the cause of death
giroo and dr wooyoung tried their best
they got general in deep trouble
let's talk this thing later
we just need to drink it
of course you don't know how much i wanted to drink it
i'm gonna drink until i get druken
yeah that's good to hear
since you're back from hell now you're a real man
at the east river's
sleeping bird
sun is shined
dad it doesn't really suit on this
let's drink  you give it a try
there you are
what if a spark gets to us
a spark we've done nothing wrong
but i can't see them in their eyes
i feel so much better
i felt bad that we've done it to them
but now jang's an engineer and doctor is the master
so i'm relieved
it's better to think that way
but how in the world could happen like this
does anyone know why
i don't know well
but giroo said jang can fix
this messenger incident
that incident how
it won't be easy
so no one knows how this end up
did you call us
you two need to go somewhere urgently
just two of us  yes
where to
you need to go to wolnagun
to wolnagun  that's too far
what do you want
you probably have seen the woman in jingak temple
the woman in jingak temple
the woman who was in love with jang
yes i think i saw her in wolnagun
huh  she's in baekjae
it seems like it
to look for jang
shouldn't she be in castle sabi then
that's what i thought
if she's looking for jang she must be in castle sabi
she's staying with merchant in wolnagun
and pretending as a merchant from soo
a merchant from soo
find out whether she's right and if so
why she is doing that for
find out in detail  yes
and this is
jang must not know this and he won't have time to
right we all know who caused this
let's go  we'd get going now
how did this happen
jang said that he can work things out with messengers
he has a plan
well i wouldn't know
surely he must have something
would he do this without any plan
yeah  but why
write that and send it to him unanimously
would it help him
if we're thinking the same thing it'll help
it'll strengthen him
finally general accepted duke seodong's proposal
they have finished their designations
would he really have the plan
if he doesn't he's in serious danger
have you stretched that thing
yes yes it's very nicely done
i have a favor  huh
whether it's taehaksa palace or castle sabi
do i have good connections
well i'm trying to show off
but out of all people i have good connection
i know it bothers you  alright
through your favor i'll show you my good connections
i think i should create a broadband myself
then find out one thing for me
what
are you engineer jang  yes i am
someone wanted to deliver this
who sent you this
you know a guy
i don't think i need to ask you a favor
what are you kidding me
what's that letter
have a seat
tell me what is your plan
you don't have one
then get out of baekjae now
if you were trying to save my life
you don't have to do this
i'll take all responsibilities escape now
there is i have a plan
the moment general designated you as the master
i got a plan so don't worry too much
i don't know whether he'll do it but i have a plan
is jang still like that
yes he's been drinking since afternoon
what is it at this night
yes i came to inspect your places
don't you have any uncomfortable things
no everything is fine
by the way you haven't decided yet
tomorrow at 8 o'clock the boat departs
we're not going with empty hands
whether we take general to drown in wang's sorrow
or take the mine we have to follow emperor's decision
would the mine be
more important than general
it's 8 o'clock decide
bring jang now
yes
jang is missing he's not there
what has he ran away
yes
find him now
bastard
what is it
how dare you
i have to decide in between two by tomorrow morning
and i've born your reckless behavior
and i've done what you had asked for
tell me now
what's your plan
i said tell me now
i already taught you my strategy
what  definitely i taught you
my life was on the line but i came back to taehaksa
and became an engineer and doctor became the master
how could this happen
nothing is something
the strategy which nothing can be seen as something
you have no plan
yes but you believed i have something
and i acquired what i needed
so now i can confront you like this
the best strategy that
weak one can use to strong one
but there is only one condition on this
one is capacity and courage
like you were fooled by me
you shouldn't be shaken in any circumstances
i mean they have to trust you
in order to do that you need capacity to bet your life on it
that's why i waited for the moment
you were driven to the edge
because capacity that i and soo messengers have
you don't have it general
no emperor sends messengers to cut off the relation
moreover according to my information
a ship was departed but it never returned
it means they sent a man to their country
but he never came back here
if you're a coward you can't use this strategy
i taught you my strategy
now it's all up to you
if you and i are thinking the same thing
it will help you
a ship was sent to soo but it didn't return
they have never discussed anything with the emperor
believe in yourself
who could it be who would send this letter
i read his thought and still i couldn't move general
his will splited him and me
you are dead meats
do you want to live  yes
there is a way put fire on the fire steeple
just kill me
i don't want no arrows in my body
let's do this
i'll do it i'll do this
if there's no plan let it drive into the corner
rat can bite cat
what will you do
now it's time tell us now
listen up  yes sir
lock up all messengers except sir gook
and execute them tomorrow 8 o'clock
proceed immediately  yes
general what are you doing
it happened anyhow i can't hand over the mine
and i'm not going either
i'll break relation with soo
i needed a man to report this situation to soo
so i leave you out
go to your country and report this sir gook
take them  yes sir
this way
let go let go you bastards
how did this happen
general clarified to break the relation
and lock up all messengers from soo
what
it'll lead to a war
i trusted your confidence
how did you do this reckless decision
please trust me lord it will work outjust fine
how can you say that with this situation
prince got to wrap it up queitly now
i told you to do this and i'll take all responsibilities
let me handle it to the end
are you confident
i will do it
lord lord
i must find out one thing
as general clarified the break of relation
is this the decision of baekjae imperial
is this true
poisoning wang wasn't enough
and you're doing this unreasonable act
is this the decision of baekjae imperial
how dare you
where do you think you're misbehaving
lord i will execute sir gook now
please allow me to execute him
i will send his neck to the emperor of soo
and show my mean
please allow me to execute him
sir gook
they are messengers of the mainland would it be ok
this is reckless please settle it now
after listening to jang who made a troble
and doing this isn't possible
it's not very reliable
no this will work
i also haven't used that strategy
but it will work on bigger nation
and he's not the emperor of soo he's just a messenger
it doesn't make sense that we have to watch them
because they have stronger nation
i believe in jang's strategy
what are messengers doing now
they don't think they would be executed
they don't think so
i'm going to execute them tomorrow morning be prepared
are you really going to kill them
yes i must success of this strategy
depends on putting every risk i have
this is reckless
what if it doesn't work what if you fail
your life is for sure doctor's life is in your hand
the book you told me to read there is a story
a man was announced to be a death row
on the execution day he requested weird proposal
if king spares him one year
he will teach how to fly to king's dearest horse
so king allowed his proposal
his cell mate asked him why he did such thing
but his answer was like this
who would know what would happen 1 year later
king might die or i might die within a year
or horse maybe the one
and who knows
horse can really fly 1 year later
do you think baekjae will be safe after this
i didn't want to come this far either
but as you said it's my fault
or as i insist it's your obstinacy it happened anyway
handing over the mine
is humliation of baekjae
it cannot be accepted anyhow
and i won't go as a hostage either
so we have to break the relation with soo
if you do that to us it's a war
fortunately we don't share the border with soo
you'd recruit forces and request more units to goguryu
the sign to break the relation
you would know it well
i don't have any personal grudge to you
but it happened in between affair of our nations
please forgive me
proceed
proceed  yes sir
proceed  yes sir
what are you doing execute them now
wait wait a minute
i'm sorry it's too late
soldiers  yes sir
wait demanding gold mine was too much i will withdraw it
didn't you say you already sent a message to your country
execute them  wait
i'll confess i lied to you
honestly my imperial doesn't know anything about his death
then sending a message to the mainland is a lie
that's right break the relation gold mine and recall general
these are not from the mainland
what how can you devise it as a messenger
what else can we exchange your gold if not papers or fabrics
we're in trouble if we go back
well it's too late
you're saying this to save your life now
but if you go back you will tell
general poisoned him
what are you waiting execute them now
yes sir  no please wait
it will never never happen
are you saying you will hide the poisoning
it's not that sir wang had a heart disease
emperor knows this so it wont' be a problem
what  and this
i'll take care of it and won't mention to anyone
please be mercy and release us
anyway i was ordered to maintain
the annual amount of gold
please i'm asking you to maintain my decency
and it won't be a problem
i will swear to heaven
sir general pleaes trust my words
general we all work to benefit our countries
let's trust them and negotiate
yes trust me
alright i want you to resume
the disclosed baekjae place in gyerim
if you do that i will guarantee the same amount of gold
i'll do that i can talk about that
remove it
thank you thank you thank you general
thank you thank you
how can you be working now
you and doctor's life are on the line
how can you be so calmed
i'm nervous this time
either you die this time jang
or my heart will explode
prince is coming
jang you pulled it off you made it
prince is coming with smile
aren't you curious you weren't waiting for it
honestly i was too nervous and afraid to go out and wait
that's tedious for you to say
well done your capacity resolved a difficult issue
lord i told him not to do that next time
is that true is it true
yes i went to palace to submit permit
i heard it myself
jang's strategy worked just fine
yes yes
what's your relationship with jang
it's more than words can express
why don't you meet him and doing this behind him
yes why don't you meet him now
yes lady
yes lady
send my letter again
yes
what is it
is engineer jang in there
he's not here what is it i'll deliver your message
no i'll come back
i hired him
you people made the incident he was seeing silla woman
and insult his royalty and my insight
he is the one who solved a difficult issue with messengers
so lord the reason he had to run away in silla
i think you should conceal it for him
i think the same
it is the vigrous youth that anyone could have done
if you can't allow that much
and misinterpret his ability and royalty
how can we hire intelligent man
i'll absolve your crime
reborn as royal servant of baekjae
yes lord
although things turned out fine
if it didn't work out
think about how much
we had to be humilated from soo
so general must reflect it deeply
and do not engage any affairs except military police
yes lord
daringly you told me to submit me
he totally got me
it's just beginning
i should have listened to your advice
yes jang defeated you mentally
but don't worry about it too much
he gets things done with reckless and capacity
but he causes many trouble because of it
i used to be like him
but i should change
to be your enemy i should have learnt
your precision and moderation
further your cruelty
yes i hope you do
i hope our fight won't be bored
prince wants to see you
yes
what's the matter why are you here and
doing nothing
that's
what's the business with jang tell me now
that's
did you come to see me  yes i have things to ask you
alright follow me
did the same person send you again
yes  what is it
i have to deliver it only to you
ok thanks
it's like you as i expected
when you shoot the world is shoot
reinstate of taehaksa isn't enough now
if you want to know my strategy you have to add the merit
we achieved and confer me as an engineer
and confer dr mok as the master of taehaksa
you damned man  he is dr mok rasoo
hand over the mine or the general has to be taken to soo
it's 8 o'clock decide
tell me now
i already taught you my strategy
and execute them tomorrow 8 o'clock

lord i will execute sir gook now
please allow me to execute him

but i realized so many things this time
it's fine with me but i heard that
you went to soyeon island because of me
i'm not trying to soothe you
it's the fight to gain the position
i realized so many things this time
even if we are apart we feel the same thing
even we're together we still miss each other
what in the world can separate us
what she's in castle sabi
yes and she met jang
she met him  yes we saw them
they love each otherso much that i didn't know what to do
then have you found why she's pretending a merchant
merchant people won't talk
but i think she's here to live
yes she won't have a id card as a silla woman
so she disguised herself as a merchant from soo
if she's here to live she came here for jang
yes what should we do about this
i get it i'll take care of this
so you need to be very quiet about this got it
of course  yes
you must be exhausted off you go
you don't tell anyone about this
you don't do it
you talk everything to your dad
you don't get busted from ms mojin
go and rest  yes
don't tell anyone
isn't jang here
no
you want to say something
you already showed your act what would i say to you
instead i'll make you to be responsible for your action
there will be a first meeting tomorrow
yes
is jang here
doctor he's not in why has jang gone missing
no
or was it silla woman
yes
i think she looks very high class
herjewels weren't normal
yes
but she came to you
yes
so she disguised herself
i don't feel good about that disguise
if i met you earlier i wouldn't have submitted the permit
why not
sangdaepo was alright
but when i submitted permit in castle sabi
a lot of people know about gakyung's father jin gunsoo
what
it might be good to get a permit
i'm nervous when she gets busted
so what do we need to do
it's better to live as a woman without name
but she can't disappear all of sudden
no i'll find out
if she can get another baekjae id
so make her stay calm
i get it but she went to office and her id is checked
i'm not sure about this
why aren't you in asleep
i have something to check
check something
why don't you wear the ring that i made
perhaps have you met other woman
the wooden chopsticks and table
lovebirds that we made you still have them
yes
somebody would be using basket that i made well
return of jang and mok rasoo
make you uncomfortable for you to stay in taehaksa
even if they do all authorities are held in bu yeosun's family
it won't be easy for them
plus the incident with jang
made general regretful that he didn't listen to me
nothing bothers me  ok
the problem is you father
when goosan brings my assets from silla
i want to start off a business
wouldn't it be the best for settle in here
but to settle down here
you need backup from bu yeosun's influence
yes
i'll find out your id
yes
i'll arrange you to meet general
wouldn't you be dangerous
if you have to live here
it's better to settle down quickly even if it's dangerous
even if you can't bear it you mustn't talk about it
about what
doctor sent you far away to do something
you don't think he'd tell me about it
then did you know about this
i knew it but don't tell anyone about this
mom what should i do
eunjin
jang went to soyeon island because of her
the woman from jingak came to see jang
what the woman from jingak came
mom you got me again
mom you must keep it secret
lord concealed everything for him
why is she here again
it's not vitality of youth
it's not vitality of youth
he truly loves the woman of enemy
and it won't be soyeon island now
he would be buried into the ocean
taehaksa is more stricted
should we send her back to silla
jang already met her
then send him together
you can't do that dad
this is serious  what do i do
jang is excellent sometimes
but sometimes he's too reckless
i know
you have led taehaksa dr wooyoung
what is the biggest problem of taehaksa
what do you think dr giroo
i think dishonesty deprived of everyone's will
no
it's us we're the biggest problem
divided us are the biggest problem
i understand the reasons of being divided
whether it's divided or have different purposes
doctors and engineers should study and investigate
we have to have achievement and outcomes
but past 10 years
doctors of taehaksa had no achievement and outcomes
agricultural method hasn't changed for last 10 years
and tools are the same for last 10 years
however out of understanding the division
if you don't have achievement and outcomes in your position
i'll demote doctors and engineers
this is my voice of becoming the master
doctor
jang is here  alright
eunjin
can't we make papers other than mulberry
well we got to try it
jang what do you think
we have to try other woods others can be better quality
yes  you know jang
how about we travel around nation
to experiment other woods
what  right that's a good idea
start from here and head to south
how about stay there about a year isn't it boring here
right right  yes with you jang
no no jang
mom we have things to do
let's get going
you weren't around all night long where have you been
i met a comrade  the merchant in sangdaepo
what no
i have a comrade sopal in castle sabi
jang
there will be a engineer's meeting so prepare it
yes
ms mojin
i have unbearable story to tell
what is it
i don't usually wake up during asleep
but i can't get to sleep and i get awaken
look at my eyes
if it's not a serious thing i'll listen to it next time
no this isn't a small matter
whether i should tell you or not
or i should seal my lips or not
like rats running around the roof they're in my head
i'm sorry i have an urgent matter
where
doctor
what is it
do you still have lingering
it's about jang
i heard it all
i saw the woman in wolnagun
and i sent them to check things out
what's there to find i don't need to hear it
didn't she come here for jang
didn't she disguise herself because of jang
you shouldn't conceal it
who do you think you were suffered for
jang benefited enemy in haneuljae and made many issues
you and jang were driven into danger because of the woman
lord will forgive what jang has done so far
but we don't know what he will do in taehaksa
now we just settled in taehaksa
i'm thinking about it as well
it will be a threat to us
if giroo or general finds out this this won't go quietly
we have to stop him you can't sit around and watch him
she's opening a big store and what's your decision
you have to decide if you don't abandon jang
i heard it all
ms mojin is saying the right thing
when i think about their love
my heark gets broken
how much they loved each other
love is a beautiful thing their love crosses border
however our lives depend on this
so either you scold him
you shouldn't cover it up like last time
i don't want to get in trouble because of them
doctor
do you know what love is
how did dr mok react
doctor announced anybody can get demoted if no outcomes
anyhow prince gets little power from them
it should be
little power must not grow big
this shouldn't be his main place
so watch jang and mok completely
don't let them to be his influence
yes sir
and wooyoung needs to find a store
a store
sir jin who had business with hae dojoo a few years ago
asked for a store in castle sabi
then it should be a big store
that's right
would he manage himself
not himself his daughter jin gakyung will do it
so go and meet her
she'll trade with nobles and she needs connections
i get it
how did it go
permit passed because of a daughter of sir jin
then he must be very famous merchant
than i ever thought
i think so
i just know her father
i didn't know he has many connections around here
but his daughter isn't quite familiar here
it looks like it
you never know
be careful for a while
i'll find out other plan so be careful until then
i'm sorry to make you worry
don't say that
i rushed things and because of that
youguys are worried about that so much
please don't be i was careless
anyone here
is this jin gakyung's place
yes but who are you
i'm dr wooyoung of taehaksa i'm here to meet sir jin
taehaksa
what's wrong isn't jin gakyung here
it's me i'm jin gakyung
you're younger than i thought
well people say that what do you want
will you greet me like this
no please come inside i'm the merchant of store
are you  yes please come in
how come you're fluent in baekjae language
my mother was baekjae person
really i didn't know that so i was little surprised
yes everyone felt the same
so you'd like to open the market for that reason
i can't say no at least
why a merchant wants to open the market for that reason
i'm here to make some money
as i heard sir jin hasn't
come to baekjae for a few years
i took care of a business of family yeon in wolangun
yeon jungkwon you mean  yes
that's why you had connection with hae dojoo
he's been cautious after that so he couldn't come
will you manage here as a woman
if you think that i'm little disappointed
since i was a baby
i followed my father every business place
i didn't mean that way
i meant wouldn't sir jin take a part of this
yes he will put things on my hand
please return safely  yes
it looks like it's gonna get bigger as jang suspected
traitor  same here
she's my mom
he's my father as well
is your father like my mom
what's the difference what what
once your father knows it ain't secret no more
anyway it's about jang
have you heard anything about jang
about jang  no
me neither  i'm not sure
but they are talking something behind our back
i don't feel good these days
did you call me
bumro go and lookout  yes
where have you been
we know that you met the woman from jingak temple
this time you should have told us first
this isn'tjust your problem
don't you know how hard you made for everyone
yes you mustn't think this is your private matter
jang now we just settled in
i'm happy when everyone is happy
you seemed fine but why why make trouble
send her back
you have to decide
i already gave you a chance
this time you have to sacrifice for ourselves
but doctor  jang
she came here for me she came to see just me
you're still thinking about her you are still indiscreet
doctor prince is coming
what is going on here
it's nothing sir why did you come down here
i was looking around taehaksa
to resume the baekjae room in gyerim
we need people and goods in workshop
yes i will hand in the plan
prince it's cold here
have you met jin gakyung
yes she's younger than i thought
really a young woman manages by herself
yes
a young woman manages the place by herself
it looks like she will do it with a baekjae merchant
and she doesn't look easy
will you do by yourself  yes
yes i'll take care of it
going out  yes i'm meeting someone
hey do you know anyone in castle sabi
why
i saw you met someone in front of taehaksa
and you said father
he's far relative he's the only one i have
that's right
and jang seems to be strange
why
he's not specially strange
after bumro and eunjin went somewhere for errand
they gossip about something and it seems like jang's
is it  anyway
since jang and doctor are back
i'm worried that you might struggle
don't worry about it
doctor told me to concentrate on study
really
find out about jang if you can
duke
you're back i was going to my house anyway
yes your father told me to stop by
yes let's go
here here
father  here you are
is that it
yes i secretly asked to steward
that will get me start something
that will do
i can get your connection
but i don't know about your identity
i did business in silla so i know some merchants
and one of them is baekjae person  really
yes he left baekjae and wandered around
he was dead on the boat
i was going to pretend to be him
find out if i can match his status
yes
dr mok
you need to excuse us  yes
have a seat
have a seat
if you tell me to live in country i will
if you tell me to live as a servant i will
please don't tell me to leave
do you know jang was in trouble because of you
yes
concealed things can become a problem
and constrict jang you know that
yes
your existence can be a threat to jang
even doctor and our haneuljae people
and also to prince
do you know that
yes i do
but are you insisting to be here in the name of love
why do you ask to sacrifice on love only
why do people critisize our love
the heart i love him is me
the heart he loves me is him
why are you saying to abandon him and me
for what
for what glory and luxury
let me protect him
i he and our love
i'll be careful
i'll be careful and careful
no i don't want to hear nay more
all of us can't be insecure because of you
being dangerous of haneuljae in silla
and being dangerous of taehaksa in baekjae are different
it was alright that you had power to tolerate over there
but nobody will tolerate this here
you must not be shaken
doctor
i told you this is the last time
i told you previous was the last time to protect you doctor
but  don't say but
don't even tell me to understand it because of love
i don't like it becaues it's love
i know how it make people reckless
i know how it concerns people
then you must know separation won't work for them
then what about my love
i've never received it because i can't have it
i live to protect you
and i feel it's my duty to do so
i can't see you getting in danger because of jang
i don't want to see it again
mom mom
you had a rowdy relative in market
it's been 10 years but he's still the same
introduce him to me
what well i can tell you his address
if you want that why
it's private matter
i'll tell you his address anyway
if you tell him my name he'd do everything right away
the location is when you across the market
look here
look here
who are you
taehaksa guksoo introduced you
sister guksoo
she's eager to hit me why did she introduce me
maybe i'm needed in something
yes  what is it
i'll bring out a woman
you can take her to silla and come back
how much will you pay me
as much as you want
yes this is the way
i'll be fine
to me her and jang
it's better for jang
why do i feel chocking
why do i feel lumping
this isn't right
stay cruel cruel stay cruel eunjin

betrayed her nation abandon parents and changed
she was the reason to be alive in chunwie battle field
i have to be alive to see her
i can't attain to be dead
this woman
i want to protect my love to the end
then
leave again
this is the only way
leave right now
that's not possible
without jang prince and doctor would have bad influence
then what am i supposed to do
i can't do this or that
protect it
protect it until the end so that you won't have any regrets
engineer mojin
if you have to protect it we'll protect it too
engineer gomo
doctor
i i will protect it too
prince is trying to export papers to persia
yes
moreover the baekjae shop will be larger than last time
and we're look forward to have profits
so prince can't manage all of them
damn  general someone wants to see you
who is it
he's a trading merchant called abigi
a trading merchant
have you ever contact him before
he wanted to give you precious thing so i told him to leave it
i didn't know he'd come to see you
why don't you meet him
since you couldn't grasp the diplomacy
using traders aren't that bad method
let him in  yes
have a seat  yes
half of my life is dedicated in ocean
i've been all around the world
i'm quite old now
i came back to bury myself in hometown
what's the purpose of seeing me
wealthy man without a boudary
is calling theives and robbers
you want me to be your boundary
that's correct
so
my wish is to serve a great man in my country
before i die
when i came back to baekjae
everyone said you're the greatest and biggest man
let's go
he doesn't look small
i can tell from his eyes he has tons of experience of storm
he doesn't smell like a merchant
i felt that as well
i'll find out about him
alright

he started to work on board since he was 15 years old
only his brother's family lives in castle sabi
they claimed they saw him once in 5 years time
what about other family
he wandered too much that he doesn't have any other
evaluation of other traders
some don't know him but others like him
he travelled a lot that he has goods
which baekjae doesn't have
yeah tell official to look after his back
yes sir
he'd be useful
how did it go
you can relieve it
general ordered to look after you
it is great

so don't worry
yes and there's a merchant from soo
she submitted the permit of store
and her name is jin gakyung

sir general dr wooyoung is coming
you can go and let wooyoung in

yes
episode 27
this woman is a daughter of sir jin
i'm jin gakyung
have a seat
sir jin helped me big time 3 years ago did he tell you
my father used to tell me that his virtue and misdeed will
be burden in my future
so exploit my bond on my own
then he won't be coming to baekjae any more
he's focusing on a business in west
and even he may have time to come i won't make him to
if i wanted to rely on his glory i wouldn't be here by myself
honestly i never heard he had a wife
first wife is from soo and second is from india
third is from japan and fourth is from persian
finally fifth is my mother
and he has total 12 children
and all of them are doing their own businesses
he will inherit his position among the best of 12
i came to baekjae to acquire his position
what would you like to know
there isn't he giroo  yes
isn't she busted does giroo know her face
i don't know  i'm shaking
i'm worried about giroo and general might find out about her
you're really driving me insane
how could she come to the palace
it wasn't intended i think general called her up
i told a man to find giroo and why isn't he back yet
i know
did you find him
giroo went to do errand for general
what  isn't it over then
by the way does giroo know her face
i think giroo doesn't know her face
aren't we too nervous about it
well it's just my guess
let me ask you one thing
an old merchant came to see me a few days ago
he's too old that he wanted to
serve a great man in his country
so he wants to serve me
what do you think
merchants have that special idea
merchants should only think about making money
how to use a merchant is your part general
i'll make money and you can make good use of me
wouldn't you be a powerful man some day
the meeting was just great
yes then i must get going
she can talk and she got guts
let's go
did general like jin gakyung
yes he was pleased he'll help her a lot
yes then i should
i met jang finally
she even meets bu yeosun
what is she intending to do
jang is not a problem any more my identity is a problem
how did it go you didn't get busted
she got home safely so nothing really happened
what about giroo
giroo was with them but i don't think he knows her
that's what i thought
giroo doesn't know her face at all
how about jang
jang will stop by at merchant's place and come here
you never know what would happen so you people
watch giroo who knows jang and the woman's relationship
and woosoo was the one who met the woman
so be careful woosoo
yes
she met general so we have to go back
i don't like that
we can't do anything about giroo
but i don't like the fact that lady has to meet general
you never know how he will use her
anyway i'm the one who have to deal with him
what do you want me to do dice is rolled already
plus we can't do anything about giroo
the comrade of duke seodong doesn't know me
he mustn't know me don't worry
after what he's been through he respect us
if he get in trouble again i can't stand it
and you're here this time
i don't care about me if this gets big
you'll be in danger
it'll be ok
what worries you so much we just keep going ahead
doctor would be worried about you so you need to return
what is it
have you seen the silla woman who i'm seeing
have you seen her
no why do you regret that incident
jin gunsoo and hae dojoo have the close relationship
so general wanted to see her and he'll look after her store
what if jin gunsoo and gakyung come back
they died on the boat
doesn't giroo certainly know her
yes
there's nothing we can do woosoo knows her face
so we have to keep an eye on woosoo
the maid knows woosoo so tell her to stay near woosoo
yes
what princess is
did she really disguise herself as a merchant in castle sabi
yes
and she met general
yes
what should i do
if we're opening stores in castle sabi
we have to face each other  yes
terminate another or compromise each other
yes father
you meet her and get it done
yes father
i knew you'd come to me
you finally showed up
yes i deeply thought of this
i feel sorry for you
but i can't choose a person feeling sorry
that's my first conclusion
like you said i have to settle down in somewhere
so i chose to stay in baekjae
this is my second conclusion
why it must
in front of me
it didn't have to be in front of you
but i don't need to avoid you
aren't we just like each other
we have to settle down here
when you reveal me and duke seodong
princess will reveal my identity
so i can't do anything
i'm sorry to say but yes
and i believe you will agree with it
oh duke seodong
how do you how do you know she's a princess
duke seodong
what is your rank who the hell are you
perhaps you are you
ask princess
you need to fix up jang and you have my agreement
what is it what's going on
you cheated everyone even doctor
and you knew all about baekjae singi
how how could you not say a word about this
how could you do this to me
i'm your woman
and i was a princess of silla
when haneuljae people see giroo
he is a mean spy
but if you think of silla's side
he was true loyal servant
still still
because me and you
he was abandoned by silla so suddenly
i destroyed his family
because our love
he was desturcted by his nation
and you have to understand to secure my position
just 3 of us have to know and conceal it
i can't do that i can't forgive him
no you have to forgive him
our love started
when nobody could understand
the enemy nation
our love started where no understanding and compromise
were held
duke seodong
follow me
didn't conversation end last night
what's wrong with you why are you hitting giroo
giroo why why  i'm fine
what the heck is going on
yes since giroo can't say much
he must have done something wrong
situation got changed  it looks like it
have you heard it  what
jang punched giroo in the face
really that's nice to hear but why
well
i don't know that either i asked if you know so
don't you know dad  how do i know that
damn what a good scene i missed
jang dragged giroo but you haven't seen them
do we have to find him
i hope jang gets hit after he dragged him
he would bury giroo
bastard
alright you did it for your country
i understand that
no if i were you
i wouldn't get busted and accomplished it
even if you're my enemy i respect that
and we have to fight for each other
and i get that as well
what i can't forgive you is your action afterward
if you had to settle down here
even if you were a spy in haneuljae
and at least if you felt heart in me
you shouldn't have used me and doctor
to be next to bu yeosun
we trusted you we acknowledged you
and we tried everything to save you
you shouldn't betray us to acquire any power
you're not a human
princess didn't tell you everything
the hwarang at age of 15
why i went to haneuljae and became a spy
she didn't tell you this
if it wasn't you
i would have married her in silla
instead of young hwarang had to offer water at najeong ceremony
you're the one who intruded in between
i spent 10 years like a day with loyalty
just looking at her
but you ruined my life in one day
when you and princess committed without hesitation
in the name of love
it was downfall of my family and destruction of me
why yours was pure and my love was misdeed
whether misdeed was grown into love
or love was gronw into misdeed what's the difference
my feeling is sacred just like yours
and i had to dispel it somehow
as i was destroyed by your love you had to be the same
but you stepped up again
yes i respect that
admit that our fight is just beginning
alright i want to take it back you're not a human
but you're one miserable bastard
i have to think about what i should do with you
i hope she's not an outsider
now you're settling down don't be stupid to blow your merits
you think i trust you i don't trust you
get yourself out of the guilt and keep the promise
or give up the promise and leave decide it
ask engineer giroo
before i pass the picket
i didn't even know i had a knife
that is true
since i became member of haneuljae
you're the first one to make me jealous and burn
thank you for saving me  thank you for being alive
i knew he was seeing a silla woman long time ago
i don't want him to see her i wanted him to stay in haneuljae
that day i went there to convince him with the letter
if the letter and writing is different it's entrapping
someone was framing jang
i'll conceal it
you don't have a choice
it's not that i don't have a choice i'm giving you a chance
to start your life which it was ruined by me
without revenge and misdeed the real life of yours
if you do that i'll fight with you
you don't have to worry about giroo
he won't make a problem
what do you mean how can you be so sure
did you fight with him because of that
a fight
no that was really personal
he won't mention it again so trust me
why didn't you tell me
i don't hope it will happen
but if it does please tell me
don't struggle by yourself
you came a such long way to me
so share everything with me
what's the reason to come here so suddenly
since my father king seonwang died
i tried to come here
yes i know that
that must be why
when i want to think something deeply i think about here
why do you have any worry
prince is doing well on every sector recently
right
so i'm thinking
lord
lord what made you come here
it happened
on this year's ritual ceremony prepare initiation
initiation whose
i'll tell you then
on previous incident i realized one thing
by looking at jang's capacity
what is it
i feared them too much
they wanted my life and i had experienced it
so i feared them all the time
that made me think that i can't defeat them
i couldn't get it out of my head
but jang showed me the way to do so
i can let it go
my life doesn't belong to me it belongs to heaven
so i'll change
i want to defeat them
it's not because i'm a prince it's because i'm right
you have to help me
my strength is taehaksa and diplomacy
and i'll start it from there
so put together all the technology
that you invented in haneuljae and here
display them at this ritual ceremony
yes sir
i'll gather messengers of each nation and merchants
to show the pride of baekjae just like old time
yes sir that's a great idea
i'll start it again
yes sir you can do this you can do this
that's the true purpose of taehaksa
i feel something wrong that king visits priest
didn't he go there often
does something catch you
it's not like that but after incident with messengers
i'm little worried that prince gets power
it's not good with sun
but prince has always been doing diplomacy
but diplomacy depends on many rights of nobles
you have to cautious
i know so failure of previous diplomacy
i'll penetrate it by trade with merchants
yes yes
so you have to watch out
for any secession of nobles sir inlaw
of course
have dr mok or prince done any strange move
except invention of goods nothing strange
how about dr mok
it's pretty much the same
he's doing his job development and investigation
i'm doing my best to concentrate them on those
that that makes me feel unease
lord prince and mok
they are so clamed
i hope they aren't turning our sight to somewhere else
do they have other intention
i wouldn't know
have you terminated fourth son of king
yes
king and prince have no reaction afterward
no
who the heck are you
tell general i'm here
you are
you ugly ass idiot
don't regret and say i'm here
uhhuh don't do stupid things and go away
i'm the captain here
what's going on
a man came to see general
what
don't you know me
you
you asked me to bring yeon gamo's son in achak
a son of yeon gamo
you know i brought a wrong one
yes what do you want
general knows something wrong
something wrong
anyway if he hears what i say
he'll be pleased so take me to him
it's true
follow me  yes
yeon gamo's son is what jang wants me to find out
i think that's what it is
he wasn't the right one
i think you should hear what he says
let him in  yes
come in  yes sir
what do you mean he wasn't the real one
3 men came here didn't they
just one came in
that's right that seodong and moksuk
and sukdoo left together
so
after sukdoo came and took all his family
and moksuk's family to run away
i wanted to check how much they have rewarded
so i followed him all the way
but when i went there moksuk was killed
what  so i thought about it carefully
you were looking for a seodong but moksuk was dead
that's little strange so i came to see you
do you know this
how did it happen
so the man who came in wasn't seodong
he was in fact moksuk
you didn't know this
where the hell is he
where is the man who was with them sukdoo
i can't say for nothing get me some
here
i knew this so i caught him tight
i asked him but he won't talk
let's go where is he  you don't need to go
isn't he the fake one before
yes he is sukdoo who is close to seodong
lock him in the storage  yes
the lady ordered to look for mine secretly
and jewel mine was found and she left immediately
prince and doctor wants this ritual ceremony
to be the opportunity of revival of baekjae
really
yes so i came to ask you some materials
for this ritual ceremony
what do you need
if they can get them in markets why would he come here
they aren't easy as yellow lacquer
you picked difficult ones
if you steal anything because i'm not here
sopal is here  you're going to hell
yes it looks like it
you wouldn't know this
but my eyes are on my hands and back
it's everywhere so do things right
and you gambled away everything  captain
and idiot why is it all yours
i came to get it so they're all mine
bro why are you doing this
jang i came to see you
yeah why
the son of yeon gamo that you asked for
yeah did you find something
you you know sukdoo right  yes what about him
that little piece of crap captured that sukdoo
he said wrong one was killed
then sukdoo is captured in general's house
that's right
because of me
what is it at this time
i don't feel comfortable
i need professional guys
is this because your comrade was arrested by general
yes
so that man asked moksuk to go in
and told him to ask about 5 colored necklace
yes moksuk asked what he is asked for
you watched him die and you ran
yes
so you don't know who he is or where he lives
yes we hardly know each other
we went there to work
so we didn't have time to ask that
are you asking me to believe that
you really really
speak to me speak otherwise you won't make it out of here
tell me anything that can be an evidence
yes think and think then you'll have something
who is it  what was it
someone invaded and went to general's room

yes secure the place  let's go
this way soldiers must be here

i know your anger and grudge towards general
but why did you go in there
you know what
we have a choice to control things with our emotion and rational
yes you should never do that

so bring those men from achak and find him
we can find himif he's in castle sabi
yes sir
don't you know taehaksa is direct division of king
i know that
military police can't even go there
but how can your private men went in
someone broke into my house last night
and he went into taehaksa so my men followed in
there is no excuse
without my permission no excuse is allowed
understood  yes
dr mok rasoo this is my obvious mistake
i apologize to you
i hope it'll never happen again
prince jang is here
let him in you can go
yes
why does your arm hurt
it's nothing sir
what happened what was the problem
the fourth son broke into my house
yes  fourth son
so did you lose him
i can smell strange movement
yes something is worng
find out they must be looking for someone
yes
king is back please go and see him
alright
lord
have you been well
yes how about yourself  yes lord
lord
what is it
near achak mine under the jurisdiction of imperial
the new mine was found that has the same jewel
really
how was it found
i don't know the detail
and i was received to send more troops
to protect it immediately
yes send them
yes lord
i heard you found jewel mine so where is it
we have a problem  a problem
people who reported that they found jewel mine
they were taken to government office
why how did government know this
around the jewel mine we found
there is another one just like it
so was there any problem in that mine
what other problem can be there
it belongs to the nation and soldiers were guarding it
so even we found it isn't it worthless
we wasted money  that's right
we came here for not knowing it
no it belongs to the nation
but nobles will take care of development
so even if we lose the mine
we can do something about development
find who was in charge of development on previous mine
the region is under sir jinryu
really  what should we do about taken people
you have to take them out
yes i got it
no i'll go with you and meet the officer
by yourself  yes that's
i'm a merchant now i have to meet people
thank you for doing this for me
i let you go since you don't have other intention
but don't ever go near
yes
yes
i'm jin gakyung and i hired them
so
i need to talk governor
let me see him
it's nothing bad so let me see him
you're a merchant
yes i'm a merchant from soo jin gakyung
have a seat
what did you want to see me for
it's not long i came back from soo
but sir hae dojoo and sir bu yeosun adore my people
that i already own a store in castle sabi
really
so i will do other things with them
wouldn't you let us to manage the mine
that my men found
the right of mine is
i won't forget your effort
that's not the problem  not the problem
all mines in soo are belong to the government
but nobles or merchants take care of development
isn't baekjae the same
baekjae dose the same but not thatjewel
what do you mean what's the difference
the jewel mine is owned by imperial
pardon
those soldiers are not from me
the guard of imperial directly manages it
the royal guard
related to thatjewel amount of mining and period
must be ordered from imperial and only belong to imperial
what is this precious
i wouldn't know
steward is steward here  yes
bring people who found jewel mine
yes
you underwent a lot
it's despondent but not underwent though
please relieve it with this and look again
you don't have to do this
by the way what's the jewel that you saw
they were yellow and blue color
blue color
yes and it was shinny in the dark of cave
shinny did it really shine
more precisely can you elaborate more
well i can't
can't you tell me in detail
well can you think of something guys
well frankly
what
i have a habit that
this is
this is the jewel of 5 colored
imperial owns and only imperial can have it
just tell us what should we do
nothing special
just drink liqour in castle sabi
and wonder around the market
yeah is that all
but open your eyes
you mean i need to find seodong right
you're smart  yes that's my job
if we release soldiers he might not turn up
so you need to stuck in somewhere quiet
and just look for him
if he turns up just follow him silently
and all you need to do is tell me where he went
yes sir
if you do that i'll give you more fortune
really
so do your best  of course don't you worry
isn't yeon gamo's son the owner of fourth neckalce
the fourth princess of the king
yes
so general didn't kill the fourth prince
i think he didn't
then what really happened
i'm not certain but he sent a man to look for
fourth prince in achak ages ago
damn it damn it
and he showed up a few days ago
what turned up who fourth prince
yes and they are looking for him
we have to find him first we got to find him
release my guards and watch heuk chipyung's move
his move will tell us where they're up to
yes sir
prince should i tell this to king
no he thought prince was dead he'll worry about him
i'll tell him when everything is certain and found him
yes sir
i'll display myunggwanggae at this ceremony
so giroo needs to teach engineers
how to make myunggwanggae
yes
did you ask for many yellow lacquers to merchant
yes i sent people to south to pick as much as they can
then go and collect them
yes
jang a man called sopal wants to see you
alright
jang jang
what's going on what if you get busted
i gotta say this
don't come out to market and stay here
i can't do that  what are you going to do
you go to captain's house now
brother what's this house
as i see here people come and go all the time
it's merchant's house is he a merchant now
a merchant
how do you do
oh jang you know me
hey it's so good to see you here
good to see you
take him
yes  hey seodong
your friend sukdoo is safe here
what really happened
why general is eager to find you
i don't know  you don't know
i don't know why he's looking for me
i think i found out
why general is looking for duke seodong
and what is 5 colored necklace is i found out
i found it
i wanted to find true identity of mine
it only inherit to direct heritage
who my father is and why my mother was always on the run
it means you are
someone asked me to deliver it quietly
prepare brass stone for prince
then  on that day
i will announce abdication of the throne
can you officially announce the fourth prince
i will reveal myself to prince
i'm the one who has 5 colored necklace
our necklace were switched and i have yours
episode 28
what really happened
why general is eager to find you
i don't know
you don't know
i don't know why he's looking for me
i think i found out
why general is looking for duke seodong
and what is 5 colored necklace is i found out
have you found out what it really is
it's related to the imperial
isn't this the same as yours
yes but what has it got to do with imperial
miners found mine with this jewel but they were arrested
so i met an officer to get development rights at least
but the jewel mine belongs to imperial directly
and nobody can develop it without order of king
no digging is allowed
the order of king
only imperial can own this jewel
only imperial can own this jewel
yes it means only lineage can inherit it
lineage of imperial
it means you are
a prince of baekjae
but
but isn't it too early to conclude by having the same jewel
prince aja had the same jewel
prince aja did
i was in charge of king's head incident
did you i was there too
did you
yes i was there to examine
but you saw prince's necklace there
yes before he carries the head he extended king's courtesy
and i saw his necklace
it was definitely 5 colored jewel
a fact that prince is wearing it
it means this is directly related to imperial
prince of baekjae
if so
my father is my father is
who is my father who is my fahter
was i born as a mistake  no jang
what is it why aren't you telling me
you always tell me i'm the son of dragon ma ryonggi
and we're always moving out
your father gave you this
father who is he
i can't tell you now but when you're 20 years old i'll tell you
until that moment
don't show it to anyone ok
how about you can't you come with me
no i can't meet your father if i do
be a great man that's the way to meet your father ok
you know who i am
without a father i was born by a dragon i'm jang
the son of a dragon the son of a dragon
why was i abandoned
me and my mom why were we abandoned
i truly wanted find myself
who i really am
who my father is
why my mother has to run away
why she told me to get achknowledgement from dr mok
don't you like it
it's too much to like
if that's true
why did she have to live like that
why do i have to live like this
i can't think of anything
i'm blacking out
i don't have energy
if nothing can be seen
if you don't have any energy just let it be
don't think about anything for now
what missing
didn't he leave after taking money
he's not like that person
plus i will reward more money if they find him
and didn't soldiers guard him
i thought he wouldn't turn up if i put soldiers on him
so i let him loose
then it must be him it must be him
yes he took his friend out so he must be with them
find him or the other man
if he disappeared he must be in castle sabi find him
yes
what is it
for this ceremony you shouldn't turn all merits to prince
so
anyway prince will use messengers
to have outcomes
you can use noble and markets
to have substantial profit
i've set a stage using that old merchant
have you
what concerns you
is this because of fourth prince of lord
the man we brought to find an invader is missing
it's definite he's in castle sabi
it seems like it
we have to get this done before princes does
we have to stop it
if there's any obstacle
we need to chop off whatever it is
did they release soldiers to find prince
no they brought people who know the prince's face
and they hid them in the market
but those guys are missing
missing  i don't know the story
anyway heuk chipyung is trying to find them
and he's searching market and area of the castle
what do we do about this
peoepl from achak really do know his face
i can tell from flurried of heuk
we have to intercept them but we don't know their faces
there's nothing we can do
we have to reinforce and follow
where his troops are going
but he will find out soon enough though
what are you going to do
instead thinking what i should do
i'm curious about more things
why mother bear king's son and be abandoned
and why aren't king or prince looking for me
but general is
duke seodong
because it's imperial matter
under the circumstances of authority
unreasonable things happen compared to outside of world
my sister stepped up and threw me out of palace
i don't blame her since i haven't done anything good
but i don't understand this
there must be a reason
determine yourself and find out
moreoever general's people are eager
to find you and terminate you
please be careful and find out
it won't be late if you make a decision afterward
jang
what is going on
people in metallurgy workshop are looking for you
alright
the number was 4 but why 1 is
how did this happen it couldn't be exchanged
when i threw it on the mountain
and when i gave it to princess sunhwa
both couldn't have been changed how could it happen
we'll take care of here eascort prince and leave
it was switched with prince's
does crown prince know this
then how come he isn't looking for me

we have to find him before they find him
we must find him  yes
dress my guards as normal clothes
and order them to avoid any collision
yes sir
by the way if you find the fourth prince
will you be able to announce him officially
well that will reveal king's lie
soldiers are all over the market

i asked soldiers and they were looking for a murderer
they're lying so they might search houses
what can we do
they will be big threat to duke seodong
don't worry how can i just watch jang's problem
i'll take care of it
thank you
put me in too i mustn't be detected
it's not working extent the boundary
yes
these are the men

what's happening
i don't know he surely tried to smuggle
why is he taking here and there
oh gosh
we've a problem  what is it
we caught the guy loaded on the box near the harbor
but he was taken by sudden intruders
intruders who were they
i think it was him he tried to smuggle them out
he's not easy find him find him however you can
we found him  what
we fought with heuk chipyung but we got him out
it's so fortunate  where shall i take him
there are too many eyes here i'll go to songgeumjung
bring him there  yes
doctor this is jang
come in
what is it
i have a question to ask
what do you want
i wanted to know about my mother
have a seat
i thought you didn't ask for a reason what happened
i was too young to understand you and mother's love
it felt like i'm denying my existence
but i know
understanding me and my woman's love
comes from you and mother's love
you two truly loved each other
but how did you separate
on the day we were going to get married
i was asked to make chisel
so i have to leave to gonghyul
yeon gamo was happy to dance a solo
for the ceremony where king's head returned
the ceremony of previous king
yes and we promised to marry after everything was done
but when i came back from gonghyul
she said she had another fiance and left me
i couldn't bear myself and i followed her
but a man accompanied her tried to poison her
poison my mother
yes later i found out he wasn't her fiance
anyway we tried to forget everything
and promised to live somewhere far
when i woke up one day she was gone
when i was in gonghyul she came to me one day
i was surprised but i didn't think it was important
but i should have asked that day
i should have left with her
then how about her fiance
one of king's guard attached to her
for quite a long time
when she came to the palace for solo dance
he confessed his love
it was before the ceremony he was executed on the spot
do you know anything about it
well i just
but i know why she had to move so many times
yes she was afraid of getting killed
that wasn't answered
and they didn't look very hostile
but why did he try to kill her all of sudden
if mother had 5 colored necklace
it was given by king surely
who was the man tried to kill her
general why
if it was king's mistake before ceremony it was their chance
prince
they tried to cover it up
there he is let's go
why aren't they coming
it's time to come
why are you alone
on the way to here we met troops of heuk chipyung
what happened
the man is dead
what dead
what should i do
he was the only clue to find fourth prince
what should i do what
don't worry sir
another man is alive i'll find him
it won't be easy
sun would know that we found out about it
prince did
yes our units were exposed to him
how did he know
they smelled too many forces were around
and we had that incident at taehaksa
i think they were watching our moves
now he's on the move i let him know this
watch his move and report to me
yes sir
let's begin the rumble
what do you mean
there were two different powers looking for you
people with plain clothes took the man out
and they weren't military polices
not military police
wouldn't they be prince's men
is prince looking for me
but the man was killed near songgeumjung
important thing is prince's people tried to kill him as well
i decided my mind
decided how
5 colored necklace was switched
what do you mean
back of my necklace has number 4 written on it
but this is number 1
how can this be
when i came to the palace with prince assassin was around
my necklace was dropped and i picked it up
i think it was switched at that time
prince aja is the eldest son so he has number 1
two other princes have 2 and 3
next is me number 4
so what have you decided
when you told me the jewel represents symbol of imperial
i was quite confused
but from the switched necklace
i'm certain that i'm the prince
so
i will reveal myself to prince
if i'm to be hidden prince i'll follow his decision
lf if
if i need to be dead
i'll follow his decision as well
no way
he trusts me and i want to enthrone him
i don't want it to be
i don't want me to be disappeared
if he says so there must be a reason
what about me
i don't care who you are what about me
no that's not fair
please think about it again think carefully for me
there must be another way to check his mind
i'm begging you please
prince this is jang  come in
what do you want
please i have a favor to ask you
it's strange of you what is it
someone asked me to deliver a letter to you secretly
so i didn't know what to do
secretly
yes
he has the 5 colored necklace
he has yours
so he wants to see you
who was he  i don't know
i got it you can dismiss
but general is watching you because of last incident
if you make a move he'll know
was it him  yes
it's not that i don't trust prince
who you trust deeply
i just don't trust imperial family
it's 10 o'clock so go with me and seochung
yes
i'm going to taehaksa you can leave now
yes
what is it
i'm here to ask you to do something
jang is out for now
did you call jang  yes but
get me a young man
bring bumro
yes
i need to talk to the doctor so don't let anyone in
yes
is the doctor in  yes
let's go in
i was ordered not to let anyone in
how come
prince is in there
why did he come here at this time
then urgent meeting will be tomorrow
it looks like it
then i'd better get going
alright
doctor
what is it
prince went out with plain clothes
what
prince was wearing golden shoes
where where did he go
through the back door
i'll back up soldiers and you report to general now
yes
time has gone already isn't he coming yet
someone is coming
isn't that taehaksa uniform
that's right
does anyone know here
only me and prince i delivered a letter directly
then
soldiers are hiding at the back
those soldiers mean he doesn't trust us
it could have been dangerous
they were trying to kill prince in the middle of castle sabi
it doesn't look like an assassination
they must have found out that the man contacted us
you must not respond to any of it
your safety is more crucial than looking for fourth prince
he didn't show up
he'll reach them again
yes if he wanted to meet prince
he found out who he is
i feel weird his eyes have got something
prince
i was desparate to know my identity but i'll forget it for ever
i still have grudge about the pain of mother
but i will forget it
i'm still sad to be born from king mistakenly
i will forget it
no i should have forgotten it long ago
instead of being confused by my identity
for my future
and what i can achieve i should have been focused on it
that was real identity of mine
that was real me
i will forget it all
just just i can't call you as a brother
that will last for my agony prince
this ritual ceremony must be prosperous
it used to flaunt the technology and ability of baekjae
and taehaksa has always been in the center of it
for last 10 years taehaksa was managed very poorly
and the ceremony became small and nominal
but prince wants to flame its glory again
i'm very pleased
thank you lord
have you invited messengers of all nations
yes lord
it's been so long time to show our strength internationally
dr mok will assist to support prince
yes lord
and 6 of department head will assist prince
for this great event
yes lord
now king's permission and imperial and 6 departments head
will assist me
and i have received messages from 10 different nations
that they will attend at this event
so this ceremony will be opportunity for revival of baekjae
where we were weak and small
it's not simply the revival
this is the opportunity for us to prove that
our culture and technology can move people's heart
that's what i want baekjae to be as well
so all of you must help me
help it's our duty to do so
no don't feel it's your duty
i want you to feel that you're doing it with me
until this is done i'll stay at taehaksa
and be with you all
we're so pleased
i think king is trying to do this so big
the chance isn't common for them
king wants to make solid position of prince
that's why i'm telling you
if it finishes well everything will go to prince
what i should do
don't you worry
prince will do big diplomatic things
but we'll get all benefit out of it
have you prepared any plans
dr giroo already made plans
to get benefits from merchant stores
really
dr wooyoung takes care of jin's store
and dr giroo takes care of abigi's store
then we'll get all the benefits
right it's been like this
prince does the work and you always got the benefits
tell wooyoung and giroo to come
yes
and i have one ominous feeling
what makes you bother
is it because prince is in the center of this
well he's always been in center of it
is it because we couldn't find the man
i just don't feel ease
so lookout for prince and king
we always
inspect all people again
yes
pardon
make the yellow dragon
did you say the yellow dragon
yes prepare the yellow dragon for crown prince
so  at this ceremony
where all messengers and merchants will be gathered
he'll announce the initiation in buddhism
and he will do it right away
then
i'll announce the abdication
he didn't tell anyone about it
but prince is
if he knows it earlier
he will make this a big deal
it is custom to give ceremony before receiving yellow dragon
when it is near the event i'll tell prince
keep it as secret and prepare not to get exposed
yes lord
you know a lot of eyes are watching you
yes
this is big decision of him
be careful not to get detected
especially taehaksa has many eyes be careful
yes i get it
messenger and merchants of 10 different nations will come
i've arranged that your store will do important parts
so general will call you soon
i see i have to settle down properly
and make good bond with him this time
yes and secure people and goods before hand
ok i got it
anyway the national event is outward
merchants do the substantial trade
that's correct
so at this event
general wants you to take a role
what kind of role is it
initiate the trade with our nobles and foreign merchants
anyway you'll get commission from it
so isn't it good for both of us
of course i'll do that
where have you been without reporting to me
even prince is staying here to work
you as a doctor doesn't do your resposbility and go out
i'm very sorry
all doctors and engineers must report
when you go out and come in
no you don't need to do that
just sleep and eat here until it's all over
yes
has the astronomical observer completed
yes
how about adornments and fabrics
don't worry it'll be done by the time
the new effect of medicines
and precious medicines of baekjae will be displayed
metallurgy workshop
i'll take care of metallurgy you need to do wooden print
wooden print
through this ceremony prince ordered us to make
scriptures to print in the main temples
it'll be great opportunity to show
messengers and merchants our quality of papers
and he wants to show that
our printing is good as silla
yes
it's very important so encourage people in printing workshop
and get it done soon
yes
yes i'll do dye

when you were about to be taken to silla
i was the one who told it to jang

your words won't do it all
before i made a move extreme agony and stress
that i received are more than words can say
but i'm not harsh and asking for material things
please say it
promise me
promise you
if jang wants to come to me let him go
the heart is mobile

i already reported it to head of workshop
really all of us are going

get ready and let's meet up at the gate
we're ready
read it when you're out of capital
what is it
it's all there it's very important
so accomplish it without any error
we don't have enough engineers for printing
if it's not urgent can you not send jang
i don't know the location well
i'll replace someone else
yes
if we're ready let's move
yes let's hurry  let's hurry
now heaven's helping me
this time i will just
take a rest here
prince prince is
are you steaming wood in salty water
yes i need to take resin out of wood and mellow the texture
this will prevent from twisting and laying eggs
this technique is just good as silla's
now we have to print it out roughly
to see whether it comes out fine
you organized the merchants well so it's doing very good
yes
you must be tired you don't look too good
since prince's staying in taehaksa we're immobile
mok rasoo has no particular move
no dr mok and prince don't go out
and they are focusing on work
why are you still anxious
yes i've never been like this
the dream is not good either
was there any other movement
engineer mojin and jang left to sangdaepo
it's for selecting indigenous products
except that nothing special
send men and look if jang's there
yes
is this true  yes it's true
then  yes
how many are here to work
four of us including me
take a rest first we have to receive a date to pick
yes
show them where they can stay
yes follow me
you need to go to castle sabi soon get yourself ready
yes
i received a report from castle juryoo
it's near the border what was the content
goguryu troops are secretly disposed near the border
don't you know this
there wasn't any report of it
but military police couldn't recognize the situation of border
isn't it a big problem
lord i'm terribly sorry to say this
but perhaps it's leaked from goguryu
it's not unanimous it's from the official
what are you doing general
you don't know what suburban officer knows
mobilize your troops and head to the castle juryoo
yes
haven't you really received any reports
no  isn't it strange
all reports go through you
how did king receive it first
what is it
i just received a message from mine officail in achak
the mine from achak is  the imperial mine
yes taehaksa engineers are in hwangok mine in achak
what
the order to make the yellow dragon for prince
this was it this it was for prince's abdication
what
lord
abdication
what on earth are you saying
dig up the yellow stone for prince's enthronement
yes
prince gets the enthronement
dig up the yellow stone for prince's enthronement episode 29
yes  king is doing the enthronement
of prince
what are you doing don't you concentrate on ceremony
now lay the mat here
the gods of heaven and earth who rules the everything
what is happening king is still alive
to enthrone the prince is
the the treason
don't you ever say that
so what's really going on
it's an order from the king
from the king
yes through this ceremony he had certainty
to abdicate throne to prince
so it's not the treason right
i don't want to do treason without knowing
be quiet
we're here for sacred mission
why are you saying disgraceful word
i was too nervous
jang you need to make the golden decoration for this
yes
eunjin you're doing the craft
yes
you need to bake pottery horse
which will be used in the ceremony
yes
i don't need to mention its importance and sacredness of it
purify yourselves and start working tomorrow
yes
so i'm doing this big
don't tremble any more i'm shaky too
i don't want to tremble  hey
i can't help it hold me tight
bumro look at jang how dignified he is
general must not know this this won't be quiet
my brother smacked the back of my head
damn it damn it
he wanted the ceremony big and seding general to battlefield
it's all intended for the abdication
yes it is
and also inviting messengers from 10 different nations
if he announces it
he thought we couldn't do anything
what can we do now
there's no case of inheriting a throne while he's alive
not specially when prince is filially devoted
that can't happen
but we can't count on it
if king has the strong intention wouldn't he do this
go and find out in detail  yes sir
in process of search don't bare out that we know this
quietly do it quietly
yes sir
no lord this must not happen
prince  you're still here
why are you asking me to commit
what a felon can do
this is unrighteous order
please remove your order
prince
have i done something wrong please tell me
i'll fix it
it's not like that it's nothing like that
there is no history of disloyalty and disobediance
in baekjae and why are you asking me to do so
this is the last thing that i can do
for my father king seonghwang
this is the last thing
i can do for you
no no
being with you standing next to me
i have the great power
i can't follow your order
please don't ever order me that
sir have you received king's order
then did you know about this
yes
how come you never told me about this
sir lower your voice
sir please calm yourself and have a seat
sir please follow king's order
what
yes sir the king has already
prepared to initiate into buddhism
what buddhism
and he ordered to us to prepare the yellow dragon
the lord is notjust telling you
the lord understands the present circumstances
and he wants to see the revival of baekjae by your hand
whose has the right lineage
yes sir please do as he wish
we have to strike them
if abdication is done in front of many foreign messengers
this cannot be undone
we can't use the force
the reason why we had to wait and bear
was to have the lineage
in front of those messengers and people
military operation is repulsive action
they were aiming for it
king is trying to make a situation where we can easily act
so he can accomplish his purpose
there's no choice if he doesn't stop at the abdication
and announce the fourth prince
we couldn't find
he's only counting on prince who has no son
if it does happen my brother will lose a chance
even if so
if we operate military action in front of everyone
i don't know how nobles will react to it
father you and the brother are in different position
he will use you as a bridge
to gain the lineage for himself
still prince doesn't have a son yet
so brother has the chance
but if not this time you don't have a chance father
i know so
tell him to pretend going on a war
then withdraw the army and strike the ceremony
father
the ceremony has to be stop
if they really do what dr wooyoung told us
announce fourth prince it'll be disaster
sir in law do you think
we have to operate military in worst case
i don't think so
i agree with you if i do that
i can be like the present king
the king wasn't like this in the first place
yes after he drove his father to battle field
he couldn't win over the nobles power
that applies me as well
if i am enthroned with the force of amry
i'm in the center of them but they will suppress me soon
i don't want to be a king like he is now
so what do we do
the problem is i have to find a way except using the military
brother
if you were well me and lord
won't be despaired like now
sir lord is here
were you here  yes lord
do you know what i'm sorry when i see third son do
notjust do
you
and second who died young
and fourth who i never saw
do you know what i'm really sorry
the fact that i'm the king
you weren't intended and was born as sons of king
you're doing what you don't want to do
second who died young and third who is just laying down
fourth who died without seeing my face
i've lived to regret that i'm a king a day after a day
lord
but on the other hand
i feel so guilty and guilty
that i collapsed the imperial power
which my father king seonghwang raised
prince
yes lord
these are all my sins
if you truly don't want this
3 of us can devote ourselves in buddhism
decide now
if you can't be a king
although i'm committing the worst sin to my father
but i'll respect your decision
but if you want to be a king
please raise the imperial power and revive baekjae
sins i caused to my father can be washed away
so that inheriting a throne can be the best thing
i've ever done as the king of baekjae
why you almost got me to do a mistake
what do i do horse face is too ugly
how's it look  too ugly
don't do this you can say there are ugly horses
but it'll be used for ceremony it shouldn't be too ugly
make it with other mud
can i do that
of course there are tons of sand but i only have one jade
if it gets wrong i'm finished
that's right
if you scream again i won't leave you alone
alright
eunjin you told me soldiers are going to castle sabi at 2
yes why
i think they're going for consuming goods
look here
are you going to castle sabi  yes we are
i have a favor
what it it
i'm the engineer of taehaksa
some goods are little short to work
so
yes so deliver this letter to merchant in sabi
where jin gakyung's store is
all i need to is deliver this
yes they'll pack you something you can bring it here
yes i got it
let's go
get the stuff what is written here
yes sir
duke seodong left to sangdaepo to see goods
it'd be better if he told me he was leaving
i'm going in for a second
what is it
jang sent a letter
from duke seodong
here
what does it say
he feels threat to prince at this ceremony
threat
prince is going to cave of achak very soon
he wants seochung guarding him
yes
and you can put a man quietly
and check out general's side
general
yes whether military is making a move or his private men
or any assassins
every little thing
yes i'll do that
we don't have time to decide now
you have to make a decision now
go and get dr giroo
dr giroo
yes
what's going on
have a seat
the king is about to abdicate his throne to prince
so i'm giving you a big chance
you said you'll put me up to throne
then there's one way we can't avoid
i'll give you the chance to work it out
we tried it twice but we failed
accomplish it for me
i don't need to explain why it is a chance to you
not other people but you
if you accomplish it without any error
you'll be the second untouchable
is this undeniable proposal
no it isn't
if you deny it you'll lose more
it's your choice
he's giving me the chance to assassinate the prince
a chance to kill prince
do you have to do this
if you fail burden is too huge
i have to succeed  but
if you can't succeed it
you'll experience the failure you had in silla
no it'll be worse
this is killing a prince for the nation
that's why he expressed it a chance
choose the dubious midway and achieve vague success
choose the dangerous one and achieve definite success
this is it
but you are caught up
i made you like this
if you disagree this i won't do it
i'm fine
i lost everything what would i fear more
do what you want to do
from the moment i choose you
my life was either everything or nothing
to risk all and gain back power wealth and princess
or i want to leave nothing like ash
i'll do that
i'll do it
so what and how will you do it
when you choose me
didn't you want to be out of this
you go to the border of goguryu
where no war is held
don't you need heuk chipyung  no i don't
if he stays back what's the difference
you being here
take all soldiers and your men with you
for this
just tell me who i need to be connected to
alright
lord
i'll do this
let your greatest accomplishment be
inheriting the throne to me
please don't be sorry to me any more
and also to my brothers
and also to my brothers
i'll change my weak character
i'll whip myself and become the one
i'll prepare for prince to leave to the cave secretly
yes yes
has dr mok finished the preparation of the ceremony
yes lord
then prepare the ceremony for the founder with prince
yes lord
general have you found out about the border
yes lord
so what's your move
i found out it was true
so i called up soldiers already
tomorrow morning with dalsol and soldiers
i'm going to the border
i feel sorry that i burdened your soldiers only
this time executive jinryu will go and assist general
yes lord
yes lord i'll hush up any noise
and construct a wall this time
that's good idea
what's your plan
you're taking all the troops and what about here
and he's sending executive with you
it means he's ordered to watch over you
yes that was definitely intended
i'll take care of everything please don't worry
and don't do anything to cause trouble
can you reach jangdoo  jangdoo
quick and knife jangdoo  yes
why are you looking for him
is he reachable  yes of course
since you moved here he's around somewhere here
then bring him here
and not those sloopy ones
select 20 of authentic men
and get ready at the market in achak
yes
gerenal and his dalsol are certain
and all of his soldiers were taken with him
what about private men aren't they the best
i think they were gone as well
can you trust this information
as i heard prince's inlaw
executive jinryu's accompanying with him
even if they left assassins to work on
there's no man to command them
i don't think they know
that would be great
but if they're on to something they need martial people
if anyone is gathering martial people
you must find out
well done it's excellent jang
is this good enough for king
yes well done
dr mok and prince will be pleased with this
well done
when is prince coming
he should be coming soon
he'll stay here for 3 days and attend the ceremony
he'll be here soon
yes
you have to be here and get things constantly
of course
now we need to change the sogokju so get one
which sogokju do you want
just plain one will do  yes
i need sogokju for the ceremony
yes
here it is
you got to give me two bottles
i don't think so they never use 2 bottles for the ceremony
are you sure about this  yeah what
are you sure just one bottle is used for the ceremony
i can't be sure but generally
it's notjust general matter
the father of baekjae worries baekjae
and he needs to drink tonight give it
you're very good
yes here you are
what if you get caught
he got tons of hidden liquor he can't find
anyway ms mojin is not coming
and neither eunjin bumro and jang
the ceremony is coming in few days
i know
i have many absentees and where do you want to go
i'm sorry i have to be away for a few days
since dr mok has to attend the ceremony for a week
you and i have to take care of here
but where do you
you're the one
my brother ordered a secret mission
leave
he's doing the preceremony so he'll leave today
there must be no error
he's leaving today
everything's going fine until now
wasn't there any movement
i think they lost us
i'm anxious that it's too quiet
that's unnecessary concern it'll be fine
this is seochung  come in
it's tonight
stand in the road to achak
and guard prince and dr mok far away
yes
if anything happens find me or duke seodong
yes
do we strike them now
no  then
send two men to chase closely
closely
close enough to be found the chase
to be found
yes
yes sir
two men are chasing us
what should i do
we were expecting it proceed as we plan
go little more and when bearers rest
you get on the carriage  yes
go to the temple where king stays
now we head to achak  yes sir
carriage and guards aren't going to achak
they're going to other direction
good they're cut out  pardon
prince is definitely going to achak
is he really  we can go to achak now
yes
everyone left to the border
so it's quiet
are you sure  yeah
nobody comes and go
why did you smell anything
yes one of our man heard something
what
abigi merchant is collecting
martial people in castle sabi
merchant is collecting martial people
who is abigi
he used to wander abroad
when we got permit he started as well
he opened a store as soon as he got permit
i think someone is looking after him
he's been trading long so he may have good connections
i got to see him
by yourself
isn't it good to see him as the owner of here
alright
have a seat
kim saheum
not any more i'm just a merchant abigi
weren't you dead
yes i almost died
and i came to baekjae to find my son
i heard about you from doham
but i guess he didn't tell you about me
i didn't
he feels sorry for how i live now
that must be why he didn't want to talk about it
i caused all these and i'm sorry
it's great that you're alive
it's all past
now we're all abandoned by the nation
it's more important for us to settle in
please don't worry about me
thank you for understanding
if you need a hand i'll help you
thank you
what's wrong do you know him
it's giroo it's giroo
what are you talking about
selected people are gone to achak already
we were late
then
we have to go to achak you command your people
we were waiting for you
is everything ready  yes
jang's here too
yes has it been safe walk to here
a few chased me but guards and baekmoo cut them loose
then you didn't come with guards
i brought a couple
don't worry too much
sun is off to the border of goguryu with his soldiers
yes
he needs to finish it and attend the ceremony right away
he can't afford to rest so prepare it now
you need to purify yourself first
and give ritual to the god of heaven
to the god of earth and water cheonma ceremony is given
last day you will give ritual in the cave
i see
please follow me
here it is
are you ready  yes
jang have a seat
you worry about me
it's not like that
i just wanted to protect you
you actually protected me last time
that's why i feel secure when you're with me
it feels like we have strong bond
i feel the same
when i was young
i went to taehaksa because i thought dr mok was my father
did you
dr mok threw me out of there
and i tried to revenge him
so i hide myself in carriage to get in the palace
really
yes but there was an injured person in the carriage
he gave me a letter
and asked me to deliver to guard wanggoo
were you the person who delivered it
yes i found out that it was from you
really how odd relation we have
you will be the sage king
you will raise baekjae again
sir get ready it's time to give the ritual
i see
you must deliver the letter to duke seodong
but i couldn't get into the mine
and if prince is there it'll be even harder
that's the out of option
don't be loose that general is gone to the border
you must alarm him that something is going on
can't you do it
i'll try
if you go into the cave and give ritual for a day
everything is over
i see
although you'll be alone
you must pray with pure and sacred mind
i see
he's the guard of princess seochung
perhaps princess found out about this
get rid of him  yes
what is it i heard something
what do we do
let's go
the border is so peaceful
the border is peaceful right before the war
is it
yes always
mom mom come out
it's in the middle of ritual what happened
i heard something and

my younger brother died young
second younger brother has been sick for 5 years
and
the third younger brother i don't even know his face
i wanted to find but i couldn't
the letter you gave me was from him
i went to the place he told me but he didn't show up
alone did you go alone
yes
my brother said our necklaces were switched
then he must have seen me
how come he didn't show up
perhaps sun already killed him and trying to trap me
i'm very anxious if he grudges me or what
so jang
you call me 'brother' instead of him
yes brother
yes brother
this this is
yes brother
i'm your third younger brother jang
you you are really
my third younger brother
yes i'm the son of yeon gamo
how can this how can it be
sir sir
you were so close
i was so close to you but i didn't know
that's why you felt so dignified that's why i favored you
you were with me in every crisis
because of you i could live
it reminds me of coming back to palace with your escort
and when you achieved the victory in chunwie battle
after meeting you i'm changed
i trust you and i wanted to trust me
that must be the family that must be the family
you're so happy to accept me as your brother and family
no words can say what i feel now
even if i wasn't accepted as your brother
i swore to protect your purpose
i know your honest purpose
i wanted to do it with you
i wanted to follow you in any circumstance
but as a human i couldn't bear the sadness of
not accepted as a member of family
not knowing you'll be so happy
i had a piece of grudge in my heart
please forgive me please forgive that i didn't trust you
jang
prince
you don't know wheter prince is dead or alive
i'm very sorry lord
what has happened tell us in detail
he gave the ritual in the cave in right order
he was giving the last ritual for the yellow dragon
but the servant who served sacrifices
tried to assassinate prince
what  assassinate
fortunately jang noticed the strange movement
the assassin failed
but still prince was stabbed
what
so  i treated him urgently
and when we got out assassins were chasing us
to lure them apart from prince we had to be separated
i should've recognized when sun went to the battle field
then you don't know more about the situation
no
send guards to achak now
yes
what am i supposed to do
please be alive you must be alive
something must have happened
is he dead
only mok rasoo is in king's bedroom
we heard that too
the ceremony is coming up very soon
couldn't only dr mok come here
since it happened anyhow
isn't it better to send soldiers and get it done for certain
no
don't cause anything that's why brother left here
you're right
trustful person may have done this
we just pretend we know nothing about this
as i heard your story you already knew everything
why didn't you tell me
honestly i knew it not long ago that general was trying to kill
i found out when i was searching it
did sun do this
yes sir
i know it's rude but i had to know
whether it's just general or imperial act
i gave you the letter to you
so you misunderstood i brought those soldiers
that you saw at the site
yes sir i'm terribly sorry
no it's good that you showed up
if you showed that time sun would have found out
then we couldn't meet now
but prince
if my existence troubles you in any way
i'll be who i used to be
your 5 colored necklace
who do you think it was given from
only king can give it to you
that means when it's the time
he will acknowledge you
when our necklaces were switched around
he thought you were killed by sun
and he shed tears
you have to understand his pain
of course i have no grudge
do you know why i will receive the abdication
when king is still alive
king wanted his greatest accomplishment be
inheriting the throne to me
what's the spirit of baekjae
to manage heaven and earth
with study and technology which impress people
that doesn't mean to conqueor the land with profit
it means to enrich the life of people
the meaning of his greatest accomplishment
to inherit the throne to you is
he orders to raise the baekjae again
he thinks he collapsed the king seonghwang
who tried to raise baekjae again
he blames himself that he collapsed baekjae
he mitigated the sadness of insecuring us
he wanted me to achieve it
sun who forgot the mission of imperial
conspired with nobles to have the profit from them
he wanted me to take baekjae back to us
sir
so when he finds out you're alive and a great human being
he'll be pleased more than me
and when he finds out you and i will follow his hope
he'll be dignified
now we can look after each other
i have you whose stronger than sun's 10000 soldiers
brother
what's to fear what's here to stop me
brother
jang
how's your body
fortunately wound is not so deep
it's fortunate  what happened
i released many people
we have to find before them
yes
i'm searching achak and around
blood was shed in the cave so someone was attacked there
so find if anyone came by at doctor's house
ok
what do you think
i think we need to watch
i don't think goguryu is trying to attack
yes it'll be better to defend first
i have to order to build the wall higher
yes
by the way the ceremony
yes
king is putting a lot of effort in it
is there any other reason
like king said he wanted to revive the ceremony
which was nominal
but the reason that dr mok became head master
it was too sudden and the scale became so large
people are needed for the preparation
why don't you go back
no
no this place is looking good
wouldn't it be better to do urgent thing
why don't you ask for withdraw to king
although the war may not occur
it'll be critical if war occurs when messengers are here
it's better for me to watch the situation until the event ends
i will do that as well
yes  yes
dr giroo sent a letter
the cave mission is failed
prince is wounded but his death is not found yet
but i have the last plan so trust me
until i reach you don't come to castle sabi
i'll get this done
last plan i got to trust him
what does it say
he's telling us to relax here
it's dangerous to go out now
i must go the ceremony is tomorrow
all preparations are finished and if someone made a contact
king will be worrying too much
but it's too much to go with your condition
i did emergency treatment but you have to rest
i don't have the luxury
king will clarify the abdication at the ceremony
i'll announce your existence as well
but out of all your health is the most important
did you hear what i said
they know the king's thought and doing this
this is the chance
everything must be announced at this event
it's crucial to go to the palace in time for the event
so i'm letting you know
i'm going in
i'm going into the palace avoiding their eyes
you're too brave sometimes
but now you're so little
i'll be well in the way i'm with you right
yes sir you're with me be the throne
right i left your necklace somewhere here
search it
i saw nothing when i came here
what did they take it
bastards they touched the prince's necklace
let's go i'll reveal their outrage
and achieve our goal
yes brother
i don't think they came here
wait
it's the cave cave  pardon the cave
damn it how stupid let's go to the cave
now  yes
i prepared some medicine if you feel sick
tell me straight away
yes i will
here it is  it's here here
get him  yes
who is it who forged you
who
we don't have time escort the prince now
yes
it's the guards of king lure them
scatter now and lure every guards
yes  and when you lure them
last plan will be dashed
come to the place got it
yes let's go
the guards of king arrived in achak
really
they can be found soon
but they aren't found yet
where they may be
the ceremony is tomorrow i can't delay any more
i told steward but i worry about him too
it's good to get out now
if our men collide with them things will get worse
i think so
then we should go to castle sabi now
you need to attend the ceremony
i'll look for them more with bomyung and seochung
i don't know the situation so i can't go like this
if they're well
they must be on the way to castle sabi
it's better to stand area of castle sabi
today is the day to give the ceremony
this is to raise the pride of baekjae
until the ceremony is over you must do your best
yes
but i don't see prince around
he just finished 1000 bow
lord at this event prince's devotion will reach the heaven
therefore it'll be successful
how's the atmosphere outside
a lot of people came out to see the ceremony
is everythingready  yes lord
foreign messengers and merchants are arrived as well
exhibite goods from taehaksa are ready too
i made connection with messengers and merchants
sir bu yeogye and jin gakyung and i will
take care of messengers from soo
sir hae dojoo and abigi and i will
take care of persian messengers
well done did you display our unique medicines
yes messengers already have interest in them
yes proceed without any error
yes lord
wasn't there any news  no lord
what can i do how
lord please don't worry
he will come if something happened
jang would have came
i hope so
he will come he will come in time for the ceremony
was there any message from jang
no
not from ms mojin or bumro and eunjin
it's killing me to wait for them
they have no message
and now i feel gloomy
don't you say that
you don't know gomo
i experienced the death of my son already
if it happens again
words can become true
he will come they must be together
it won't be easy to come with prince
yes  they must be trying to contact us
what can we do
tell me what i can help
i'm just sitting around and wait
my eyes are spinning and medicines don't work
i feel tired but i can't go to sleep
in case i don't see the world again
you go to jin gakyung
and  release a few men
and send men in every gate of castle sabi from achak
i'll be quick
if anyone reaches her let me know immediately
of course
i have to place perfume at the altar you stay here and wait
i'll do that
i see the altar everything's ready
it's about to start
yes it looks like it

don't say you only have me
i don't want to be myself
don't say i can do things well
i want to achieve with you
if you were going to die i shouldn't have known this

how how can it be
what has happened
how can this be happening
he was attacked at the market office just before the ceremony
damn it damn it
i got to go to the palace now
i remember my father used to say
the fight for the throne is harder than fight for nations
i'm so fearful and sad
prince knew my existence
have you told him
yes
that was all misunderstanding
he was so pleased that i'm his brother
and he joke with me
he said i'm strength to him
but
but i couldn't protect him this time
i should have protected him
i couldn't
don't blame yourself it's his life
that was the destiny of heaven
no it was done by human
the human with evil deed
i won'tjust watch
i can'tjust watch
what will you do
nobody knows who he is or wants to do him
i can find with this
what is it
the id card was ripped off from the man who killed prince
the office name and age are here so i can find him
they must be one party
i'll find every each one of them
you need to look for ms mojin bumro and eunjin
who didn't come yet
yes
i'm worried that they're not here yet
it must be their deed
don't worry i'll find out
prince how this happened to you
how can the great baekjae of prince be attacked
this unacceptable thing in day time
how did it happen
i'll find out
even it takes to search whole baekjae
i will find who did this to prince
lord
don't feel it's unfair just think this is it
just curse our fate in this heartless place
what did guards do
lord as i heard there was an assassin in the cave
why wasn't he praying with other people
it's my fault
was this to be disguised
what was the reason
i was trying to abdicate
the throne to prince
lord even it was your arbitrary decision
it is from you and we'd have followed it
but why was it so poorly done
now it caused to cancel the ceremony
and messemgers got to know this
notjust a commoner the prince of the nation
was killed without any guard in front of office
you shouldn't have sent me to the border
but to protect prince
i will eradicate whose act this is
i will find who did this to prince
did you call me
i heard you were escorting the prince
who the hell do you think you're to protect him
what has happened tell me the situation
there was an attack from the cave
so i escorted prince and escaped
dr mok participated to lure them
so we got separated
what happened after that
i escorted deep wounded prince to cave
i treated the wound and he became concious
and he wanted to come for the ceremony
i told him not to his body wasn't healed
he said he'll be fine on the way so we came to castle sabi
but at the office
whoever did this he'll be punished
whoever forged him to do
he will be punished as well
didn't you see the man who attacked prince
no i don't recall
tell me if you have anything
i don't have anything to tell
alright you can go
i will find him
must
i'm surprised of your delicacy and daring
continuous preparation for the failure
who would know you'd do that
i never thought in front of office with people watching
if it is more secretive suspicion will be bigger
i won't forget your merit
these were in the cave
it can be evidence so i brought it to get rid of it
it's the prince's
because of this
sun you did
are you suspecting me
you got it wrong it wasn't me this time
would i do it when everyone's watching
that poorly  then
i don't know someone who had more grudge than me
still haven't heard from ms mojin
no bumro and eunjin have no message
now i have ominous thought
doctor i can't stand it i'll go and find him
doctor  oh mojin
it's the ghost
how did it happen why are you coming so late
where is ms mojin
mom told me to bring doctor
don't you eat meal
yes he's very dogged how can he refuse to eat
i heard about prince on the way to here
i was worried about you what happened
follow me
do you know abidal  i don't
welcome  do you know abidal
do you know a person called abidal
yeah you know him
abdial i know him
he's about 25 years old right
yeah around that
he's about 5 feet tall and very fast right
but why are you looking for him
this is the house wait here for a second
abidal abidal
this is the man
i'm abidal
sorry
did you really bring my id card
i thought i lost it in castle sabi
why did you go there
i went to escort sir jinryu
sir jinryu
is this executive's residence
yes but why
id card which was ripped off by jang is jinryu's servant's
yes when he tried to reveal more
he'll be driven into the corner
jang had flame in his eyes
and he's working hard in achak
but the problem is people
many people suspect us
blam it to silla or goguryu who purposely did it
to cancel the ceremony
it won't be hard to do so in military police
so drive it to a war smoothly
yes  right
we can turn things around to a war
people will forget things when they're desparate to live
disguise a report in military department that
silla people killed prince
yes
brother heaven is still on my side
the position you didn't suit and felt comfortable
you should have inherited to me
this is
this isn't the prince's
we have a problem
what happened  come out
is this the man who attacked prince in the cave
that's right
has anyone seen him
several people jang and ms mojin
you evil you you
put up your head
is this him
this is under military police who caught him
taehaksa people found him on the street
dalsol take him to our office  yes
investigate whether it was silla or goguryu
no
what no do guards have the right to question
he harmed crown prince
it's right for us to question
he wasn't simply to harm prince
i received information that our enemy tried to
confuse baekjae through the ceremony
take him  yes
back off
what are you doing
don't you trust me  you can't do this
i told you this isn't for guards
no  back off
cut it out
i'll do the questioning
he was the prince and my son
i will question him myself
so general can back off
how did it go didn't it overtake by military police
fortunately king will do the questioning
it's good it's fortunate
questioning who does he question
engineer mojin caught a guy who harmed prince in the cave
what wasn't he dead
you know who she is
almost dying person who has to be buried
she brought him alive
he should've talked everything by now
whoever forged this evil conduct
they are dead meats
doctor you saw her her white face
was turend yellow and go out
ms mojin huh straw is on your face
how did you save him
so to catch the guy
i penetrated where arrows are coming like rain
i have to do crawl  really you're awesome
and ms mojin and eunjin were shaking to death
arrows are coming to us so what
i had to carry them in my arms
i thought i had to catch the guy
thought what
that i have to appease prince's grudge
so i will appease it i'll appease it for him
bumro wake up
i tried not to break your spirit
what  this is too much too much
eunjin  why
is bumro saying the truth
it's true
yes if you didn't carry him
i couldn't have saved him
you saved him
the wound was too deep
he wasn't nearly dead he was dead actually
so so  so what
i used the craft and meidicine that i've learnt
i save him in 10 days
then i was so exhausted
you must be
ms mojin isn't good at anything
she's just old for nothing
anyway you guys did everything to bring him
i hope the man behind to be revealed
stop pour water
he's alive
yes questioning is about to start
so we can find out who killed crown prince
it's good it's fortunate
i thought i was played out for general's trick
and i blamed myself
it won't happen please walk your way to the palace
yes
we had to stop it do we have a reason
how can we stop king's questioning
what if he confesses
general told us he's not involved
but it was to shut out as a secret
the reason why he didn't tell us
is to pretend we know nothing about this
even if he confesses
we have to block it with just him only
stop
you mustn't kill him
until you tell who did this you can't die with your own will
i won't kill you
if you tell me who it was i won't ask your crime
if you want a position i'll give it to you
if you want 1000 gold i'll give it to you
i'll do whatever you ask just tell me who it is
are you sure we can trust him
i'm sure he won't talk unless he kills himself
king changed the approach he's conciliating the felon
scarier than torture is the sweet conciliation
he even offered him 1000 gold and pardon his crime
if we don't make a move we can be in trouble
there's one more thing we should worry about
this isn't the prince's neckalce
this is the fourth prince's we were looking for
why did prince have the fourth prince's
was prince wearing the necklace at the office
yes
but another necklace has 4 written on it
does it mean they met
this is critical even if he died
when fourth son is announce  that mustn't happen
there's a way to fix two things at the same time
how did it go
have they found who is behind him
king's conciliating him now
your testimony can be needed
so you stay put here
yes
yes let's do that
brilliant idea if that happens we can fix two things
if he stays alive he will go to jail tonight
jail is under military police  yes
yes tell him the plan tonight
what if he can't bear tonight
show him this
this is the sign between him and me
if you show this he won't confess
do as he said
yes
do you think he can protect you
do you think he can release you
your ability and loyalty are ashamed
i'll send you to vietnam
there are soldiers of baekjae
i can confer you a commander
you can be safe there
he's biting his tongue gag him now
yes
take him to jail
yes
lord he won't talk easily
bring mok rasoo and jang tomorrow
yes
i have to match their stories and lead him to make a mistake
here it is
go in
you can go  yes
king will clarify the abdication at the ceremony
i'll announce your existence as well
so when he finds out you're alive and a great human being
he'll be pleased more than me
and when he finds out you and i will follow his hope
he'll be dignified
do i have to tell the lord
jang
yes
to pressure the man
you and i are going to the questioning room i let you know
yes
did you think about it
did you think about it
execute him
lord
will you let me go
i just need to tell
the truth
i promised as the king of baekjae i'm not lying
who forged you to do this
will you guarantee my security
you're not going to kill me
no who forged you
honestly
honestly
he told me he is the fourth prince
he clearly mentioned that he's the fourth prince
has the prince met the fourth son
a few days ago someone sent prince
a message that he has the necklace
now he's spotted as a murderer he can't be a crown prince
the incense burner didn't come to me coincidently
before prince died
he told me who the fourth prince is
if you tell me i won't ask your sin episode 31
who forged you
if i tell you will you let me go
yes
honestly he told me he's the fourth son of yours
he told me he's the fourth son of baekjae
what fourth son of baekjae
i don't have fourth son
how can he ordered you to assassinate prince aja
bastard you need to be ripped apart into pieces
i promised you as his father
if you tell who's behind this
you tricked me with the lie
i'll execute you in front my eyes
prepare it wanggoo
yes sir
prepare it  yes
we have a problem
why didn't jangdoo do what he was asked to do
when he confessed what we told him to
king ordered to execute him now
now  you must hurry
yes why didn't i think about this
i'll give you the last chance to say it
who forged you to kill prince
the fourth son
don't lie and confess the truth
he told me he's the fourth prince
you rascal execute him now and hang his head
yes
execute him  yes
stop
this is imprudent general how can you stop king's order
i'm terribly sorry lord but
soldiers picked up this from the cave
this is
do you know this
what is he showing
i don't know
how do you know this
he gave me this and show it before kill prince
he said that he's fourth son of king
imperial and prince aja is trying to kill him
so he has to revenge
are you sure he said he's the fourth son of the king
yes  what did he say
and he's the fourth son of king
he's a son of yeon gamo a dancer
lord
lord escort lord now
dalsol  yes
lock him in the prison  yes
lock him up  yes
lord i was very surprised that i saw this jewel
how could it happen
baekjae doesn't have fourth prince
but how can the jewel have number 4 written on it
and how could he assassinate prince
how can this be real please tell me
you have to tell us to catch the assassinator
lord
pleaes tell me
general look at the lord now
he needs to rest now come back tomorrow
i'm sorry lord
i was obssed with assassinator
so i disrespect you lord
do you know what the man is saying
you understood yeon gamo's son is fourth son of king
do you understand it
yes doctor
oh my then you are
you you are
yes doctor
jang how can this how
that's why yeon gamo sent you to me that's why
yes doctor
why are you doing this get up
no i can't do that
rule is rule please receive my courtesy
i'm not in the position to receive your courtesy
if you do that i'll be killed
but prince
please treat me like you did that's the way to save me
after i become a prince
when i become a prince wholly and stand in front of people
it won't be late you to do so
do you really want me to be killed
doctor
i understand
please drop your honorific
what happened here
aja and fourth son is dead for sure
when aja came back from japan necklace was switched
but when it was switched again and he had his
and what's this necklace with number 4
honestly we thought fourth son was dead
we found out not long ago that general was looking for him
so how did it go
and prince was doing his best to find fourth son
so he found him
if he did he'd have told me
who knows this more
it should be baekmoo eunsol
bring him bring him now
how much she had suffered with knowing this
i shouldn't have sent yeon gamo with her broken heart
she had reasons why couldn't say
i got angry and questioned her
when she sent you and when i asked her to go to silla
doctor don't do this to yourself
still mother would have appreicated what you did to her
she would be the happiest moment that she ran to you
but how could you not talk to me or prince
i misunderstood that imperial doesn't want me
but i confessed to prince
and he knew this before he died
yes
how pleased he must be
he favored you and you're his brother he was surely happy
yes doctor he wanted to assist king with me
and he said he is cured and has to go to donmyung ceremony
but i couldn't protect him
it's not time to blame yourself
how you are driven to a murderer
this is an intrigue of general
and what's the thing he showed to king
it's not certain but it must be the necklace 4 written on it
necklace
prince told me his one was switched
but how come he had his one
and general has fourth one
well i don't really
has he met fourth one
someone sent prince a message
that he has the necklace
so has prince met him
general's people came middle of nowhere
general
yes he was wearing plain clothes
heuk chipyung's troops came
general is driving fourth son that he killed prince
what
i certainly think it's general's conspiracy
but was there any situation that fourth son had grudge
if he misunderstood that situation
misunderstood
the day he meant to meet prince
if he misunderstood the troops of heuk as prince's
fourth son could have thought that
prince was trying to kill him
then it's possible that he was telling truth
you gave the switched necklace to prince
and yours was lost in the cave
yes so i can reveal myself
they don't know their necklaces were switched around
they're using that strategy because they don't know me
i'll reveal myself
i'll reveal and i'll revenge for prince
i see but you have to wait jang
king doesn't know about you
he'll have huge impact on
what general has showed him
even if it's conspiracy you're a murderer now
if you respond to it poorly you'll be hurt
i'll find out the situation
i solved it once
i was annoyed by existence of fourth men
but now he can't even admit where he had fourth son
now he's spotted as a murderer he can't be a crown prince
what if he shows up and deny all of these
he can claim that he didn't kill prince
it can be the worst situation but this is still good enough
who the fourth son is and who he is hidden
it is better to be revealed then being anxious without knowing
that makes us the solution
there's nothing scarier than invisible enemy
yes
anyway all we need to do is see panicking lord
yes
i was looking for you
i know you were surprised to hear yeon gamo's name
it happened before the ceremony of previous king
so i couldn't tell you
yes but what was general showing to the lord
that
tell him
lord general is here
bring him in
lord you have to tell me now what's that necklace
tell him
lord executive is here
bring him in
i can't believe this
the person who killed prince was the fourth prince
how can there be a prince that i don't know about
is this really true
the hidden prince killed crown prince
the authority of imperial has dropped on the ground
please make it clear as possible
perhaps 20 years ago before the ceremony of king
i hope it wasn't her
this cannot be happening
yes lord this must not happen
who is it
you got to tell us now so you can relieve prince's grudge
jang
yes
what happened to questioning did he tell who's behind it
yes i'm curious did he talk
he didn't talk sir
what if he shuts his mouth what happens then
can't i catch the man behind this
i can't do that i can't do that
i will reveal it i will
jang do we get reward for catching the criminal
what's wrong with jang
he's disappointed that the man doesn't talk
you know they don't talk in the beginning
but if he gets hasseled wouldn't he say anything
would he do that
no warriors can bear the torture
i hope it's right
don't worry just worry what to do
with your reward
i'll open a merchant shop
i want a tavern with ms mojin
why you use my reward
i use mine why do you use it
damn it
you  dad
you always do this i'll just
well done
although you were at the border
it was the great a scheme to prevent all the suspicion
we could get from prince's death
strategy what are you talking about
it wasn't me
i came back and investigated the man who harmed prince
in the process i found out that
the fourth son tried to kill the prince
right that's right
your words make me disappointed don't misunderstand me
don't be disappointed that he's not telling us all
it's better that less people know this
don't you think father
then do you have something in your mind
he's already preparaing for what is after the abdicaiton
after
if anyone knows he led to kill prince
somebody can hold his feet
when he commands the authority
so he's doing it fine
don't you get it
he's restraining you father
well to be exact it's my mother
even if you have different mother you have the same blood
you'll see
the distribution of honors to enthrone you
you mother and i will be excluded from it
how may i help you
what's with fourth son's necklace
what do you mean what are you talking about
will you pretend you don't know about this
i don't know what you're talking about
you think his power can do anything
but rather my father has the authority first
and his inlaw
the strongest authority hae family
doesn't move by sir hae dojoo
in the center of hae's power my mother stands there
i think you're taking a wrong idea
what do you want
i have things to give to dr giroo
what is it
merchant jin wants to see him
merchant jin why do you see her
well i don't know
why do you want to see him duke seodong will be angry
i have a business
he's coming
i thought we won't be seeing each other
i don't feel sorry at all
i trusted that my words made you suffer
and it led you to do difficult decision
and loved me on your own way
but it's not
you could do anything for your rise
that's why you killed prince
and you did it without flicking your eyes
in the process of killing
i know your father abigi was involved in this
i don't know what you're talking about
it's true that my father is doing business to survive
but what has it got to do with killing the prince
how evil you are
you may misunderstand due to imperial's critical condition
the man who tried to kill prince is the fourth son of king
he is revealed to be the one
what what the fourth son of the king
so don't ever call me like this
as i'm not the hwarang you're a princess of silla any more
they don't know our necklaces were switched around
or nor my existence that's why they're using this plan
so i can reveal myself
i can't believe this
the fourth prince killed the prince
how come there's another prince i don't know about
is this really true
the hidden prince killed crown prince
the authority of imperial has dropped on the ground
yeon gamo when you asked me to look after jang
she wanted me to protect him in danger
did she go to see giroo again  yes she took chogi
why giroo again and by herself
he's waiting now  yes
i think she's here
why did you see giroo again
what's happening
how come the fourth son became the murderer of prince
jangdoo who was saved by mojin confessed that
pardon
it must be their deed
even if general and heuk were at the border
it must be their deed
to be exact it's giroo's act
what do you mean
i don't have any evidence to prove it
but when you and prince were in the cave
merchant abigi made a move to achak
merchant abigi
abigi is a father of giroo
how is it going
lord asked me whether his fourth son can be found
so i was asking to eunsol baekmoo
you knew yeon gamo perhaps you know something
if we find him what happens next
well lord just wants to know who he is
nothing would really change
don't you think
i think so if he's the man behind this
that's not true at all
what i mean is that it must be general's conspiracy
then it's worse
general will try to execute him as soon as he shows up
yes if it's consipracy
why would he drive fourth son to a murderer
because he's the fearful existence to him
sir imperial guard
what is it
you need to go to prince bu yeodo's room
why something happened to prince
i think he's getting worse  what
so lord is on the way
i see let's go
doctor jin gakyung wants to see you
i think it's urgent
what is it
what do you want to say
i heard you know the identity of seodong
you knew it  yes
is that why you wanted to see me
not that
he couldn't bear his anger and sorrow
he went to see the lord
yes but i think revealing his identity now
is the trap he may fall into i'm worried about him
honestly i know a situation that dr giroo has done things
so i told him  what
he was so upset that
he has nothing but anger and revenge in his heart
can we leave him alone
honestly i have things to consider
also jang won't behave that easily
he knows what it means to reveal his identity
there won't be jang we used to know
if he reveals himself either he become a sacrifice
or prince it's either one
jang
come inside i need to talk to you
doctor i'm sorry
but i have to think about something give me some time
disgrace king leaves sadness and sadness lays mistakes
but mistake bears a man and the man burns incense himself
the man who burns incense will become a king
king will arise baekjae and gain enormous glory
yeon gamo spent a night with the king
the man who was born mistakenly
when the incense burner came to me
when she pregnant jang it wasn'tjust coincident
who was it who burned incense
who is it who came to my workshop
who burned the incense
jang
yes
when you came to me for the first time
yes
did you see bronze incense burner in my room
yes
when was it
it was the coronation of crown prince
was it burned
yes
then then the owner of oracle
was you jang
lord you need to sleep
i'm worried that you might get sick
please go to bed
since my fourth son became a murderer
if you'll die i have no reason to live
lord
nothing seems to be worth nothing seems to be worth
i feel much better today
that's right general
king already lost every motivation
and he's not coming out of the prince's room
he's going to announce the abdication soon
this is your merit giroo
no if i hadn't have sir abigi's help
i couldn't have done it by myself
really
yes that's why i brought him without asking you
yes you should
if he helped me he deserves to drink withme
be my strength with dr giroo
you deserve it general
i would do anything for you
what are you doing let's get drunk
it's a big fortune that i met you
i'm flattered
no
the man to achieve the throne
not only he needs strength but heaven and people' luck
since i met you heaven seems to be hleping me
my path will be strong and broad
since when you were close with dr giroo
this time
you tie the bond with this big case
people who devise they recognize each other
you think it's over with me
no i'm just starting now
did you think i would give up my goal that easily
you got me all wrong
isn't this sogokju and three bottles
yes prince granted to me
from prince
if he granted it to you
he knew it would get to me
you've always been like a father to me
this is all i can give you sorry
i'm happy with this
what's wrong with mine
you got to study you want to be like your brother
this is what i studied myself you can have it
what about you
i'm going to it as well thanks anyway
i'd get going now  ok see you next time
what's wrong with him dad
it happens sometimes
when you wake up one day you're thankful to people
he has to be like that just to me
really did you make this for me
well it wasn't for you
it's the pattern fabric that we achieved for the first time
really this is meaningful
i want you to have it
why why did you think that
thanks anyway
wow i was going to wait for 10 more years
but he finally found my value already
i feel so much better
it's silk silk
what are you hiding
why don't you and jang say about questioning
i feel so heavy please talk to me
doctor this is jang
come in
i'm sorry but i need to go to somewhere for a few days
is there more to think
yes
i'll let you go
doctor where are you going at this crucial moment
but if you have to go tell me what you think first
yes
doctor
he's struggling because of the prince incident
take good care of him
what achak
why achak are you going to the cave
no i want to enjoy
pardon  i want to enjoy with you
i have permission from doctor
this is the last house i lived with mother
i hadn't listened to my mother badly
like you don't listen to me i can tell you did
i didn't study and digged up the noble's grave
i made a grain bean bomb
if i were her i would get angry and gave you up
if you were my mother i wouldn't have done that
right i would punch your
but my mother bear everything
she always smiled at me and cook nice meal
although she didn't eat she always cook with good grains
she used to cook some seasoned vegetables for me
i'll do it
then i'll cook rice
are you sure i can eat that
don't eat too much later
something is on your face
why here is it here
you're pretty good
open yours
what's this
rainy day is a flat cake snowy day is porridge
instead i'll feed you
i thought of you coming here with danger you had to deal with
you told me revenge is tedious thing to do
but why is revenge tedious
if it's tedious to revenge who killed my mother and brother
what is worth in this world
i'll get my identity and position back then revenge him
it's too dangerous you have to think rational
i don't like that rationality
i don't want to fight with the way to escape
i don't have the exit
no i don't want to make an exit
when i get to back off
i'm afraid to back off when i fear the death
i'm afraid to give up when i think about happy days with you
for the first time i resent our love with you
and my heart is broken
the way i insist to go
i may not be able to protect our love
should i stop now do you like if i do that
that's why i came here with you
i need your permission
i need your permission because i belong to you
after revealing myself i'm going the road of
either i get killed or become a crown prince
i have to do that tedious revenge so i'm going
please allow me
go in
are you going now
go in
go in otherwise i can't go
you're back
what's wrong something happened
what about jang didn't he come with you
what's your business at this late
i need to see the lord
for what  it's about the prince case
but dr mok said you lost your temper for it
and he told me not to let you in
no it's not late
it's not about losing my temper please let me in
if you want to see the lord come with dr mok
sir guard
bring him in
go in
what is it
what do you know about the case
yes lord before prince is dead
he told me who the fourth prince is
what
i have a plan to prove that
the fourth prince didn't kill the prince
so will you follow my way
what  except the urgent people to work
did he want all taehaksa people in questioning place
yes that's what he told me
who who sent the order  eunsol of imperial guards
it was an lord's urgent order
so i delivered it on my way to taehaksa people
why does he want us there
he must have confessed that general forged him
let's find out
i wanted to see his neck twisted
and saying 'yes i did it' i gotta hear this
but why do we have to be there
they need witnesses
right otherwise he'll deny his confess
i hope so  let's go hurry
hurry  wait for me
is this true
yes they told us to come to questioning place
do you know why  well i have no idea
go to questioning place
notjust general they called up all people in the palace
all people
yes i thought only taehaksa people were called up
but officials of palace were called up as well
what's happening questioning has stopped meanwhile
don't worry too much
even if he quesiton him again he won't get anything
i think he's going to settle it quietly
you'll see let's go
start it  yes
have you met the man who forged you
yes
do you remember his face
yes
if he's here can you distinguish him
yes
good take a look at everyone here
and find him
all men stand in front of this man one by one
it'll start from taehaksa
general you have to do this as well
do as he say
are you sure the forger isn't here
that's correct
you didn't see him  no he's not here
you said the forger is my fourth son right
right
it's right  the fourth son is here
the fourth son step forward
the fourth son step forward
lord
lord  what is it
prince prince bu yeodo just died
what
do is this true
yes
no no
escort lord
you lock him up again and follow the lord now
yes  lord
you return to taehaksa and prepare the funeral
yes
who come the fourth son is here
why are you making me so miserable
i couldn't see your last
without a word how can you do this
that's the only way
to prove false accusation and the truth
have you told you're his fourth son
i haven't told him i told him that prince asked me to do so
he might not announce because of me
so i haven't told him about me
it happened like that but half is successful
he said there was no fourth son there
it's clear now i didn't forge him
if i reveal myself everything becomes a lie
but i don't think that way
the most important thing is to protect you
i mean you have to be preserved
was the fourth son really there
that's why he made that situation
he disguised it because jangdoo couldn't recognize him
now it's hard to drive him to a murderer
but do is dead
his continous shock will make harder for king to manage it
we have time so let's make a plan
don't we have to do military operation
he was there
among those people he was there
who was it who would it be
i will investigate every single person who were there
find him find him
what do i have left here
too light you and miserable my body
i've lived with guilt of unfilial to my father
i have to live with the sin toward my children
i shouldn't have be born from lmperial family
lord please we have to move him
lord  go away
get out now
lord you should
go and get jang
lord
bring him
go and tell the fourth son
don't ever come to me
tell him to forget that he's my son and imperial family
tell him i have no power to protect him or desire to do so
i don't feel sorry or miserable for him
fortunately he was hidden
he was hidden
that was the only way to protect him
and it was fortunate
tell him to live freely and comfortably
yes lord
lord
go and tell the fourth son
don't ever come to me
tell him to forget that he's my son and imperial family
tell him i have no power to protect him or desire to do so
i don't feel sorry or miserable for him
fortunately he was hidden
he was hidden
that was the only way to protect him
and it was fortunate
tell him to live freely and comfortably
yes lord
lord
lord do you have to do this
do you have to step back like this
what's the reason you wanted to abdicate the throne
didn't you ask him to raise the collapsed baekjae
the general who lost his motive and conspired with nobles
didn't you ask him to take baekjae from him
because you meant that
he knew it was unfilial and had fear of death
he accepted the abdication
he told me he will go through any circumstances
how come you're trying to trample prince's will
and remove it from him
lord
this is all your fault it's your fault lord
your strength your desire is just this much
the death of prince and all other princes' death
and unrevealable fourth prince
it's all because of you
crown prince was different
he told me that he will protect the lord
and third prince who passed away
and security of fourth prince you haven't seen
but these have to be done by you
and you had to be the bridge of it
until the day you pass away until the day you pass away
you should've been the strength until the end
then no prince would've been dead
and the fourth prince didn't become a murderer
and hid to live
a small person like me have this inflammable revenge
which hurts my head and heart
why are you giving up why do you tell him to hide
i'll tell him exactly what you said
i'll tell him that your father has abandoned you
and i'll grudge you
how dare you
how dare you say all these rude things
lord please kill me
just order him to kill me
that's better than this
please kill me
remove it
lord please calm yourself
you're exhausted for few days
what are you doing untie him i said untie him
i never thought only sadness and confusion will be left
i know  you don't you don't know
i can't be here any more
i will quit everything
if i live as a coutryman and fishing for my living
i can do it with more confidence
i can live greater than this
what is it that you want to quit
is it prince or loyal servant of prince
or is it engineer of taehaksa what are you quitting
everything
what's going on
why is jang so mad and leaving
and what's the fourth son thing
i'll write you a letter you deliver it to jin
it seems like jang went there
lady bumro from taehaksa is here
what is it
this letter is sent from dr mok
where is duke seodong
doctor told me she would be here didn't he come
no
you need to find duke seodong
yes
no i have look for him as well
yes
what's going on  find duke seodong
yes
let's get separated and find him
yes
you can come with me bumro come
he's not here
do you think he'll come here
he might this place means something for them
mean what does it mean
this place is so beautiful and scared and so sweet
what are you saying
i mean duke seodong and my lady at here
they held each other and you know
they gently did that
what
what would it feels like  no idea
his face is little sad but he's quite pure
he's not here
right it must be there
do you think of a place
the grave of prince aja he should be there
prince i couldn't follow your last will
i was going to try it even if i don't have ability to do so
i was going to try it even if i don't have power to do so
i was going to do it no matter what
because it was your wish
i can't watch them who killed my mother and you
devastate the baekjae of yours
but i was discouraged
king told me to fold it king told me to forget it
i'll resent the king i'll resent him more and more
the king who doesn't wreak prince's grudge
made me a murderer i will resent him
please forgive me forgive me prince
now it's all over
now i can leave with you
yes
what's wrong
i sprained my legs while i was looking for you
it's alright
i'm not alright
i fooled you again i'm very fine
how can you do that a day like this
i was so afraid
i did it because you were so lost that you'd let everything go
you have me to hold and protect
not as big as baekjae but you still have me
and i wanted you to have hard time
lay down so you can rest comfortably
i wanted to put you to sleep
put your tired body and mind to me and go to sleep
i'll order not to think please don't think anything else
just go to sleep sleep
what
all of us aii
yes perhaps he's going to finish the questioning
didn't he lose his will to do so
he did
let's just go
do you know what's going on
i don't don't you know either
no  let's go
lord you don't look good
i'm fine
before i pacified the continous loss
of crown prince and prince the reason why i gathered you to
is to make an important announcement
the felon jangdoo who tried to assassinate prince
military police can take care of him
lord how can
i'll treat the crown prince's matter as the means of heaven
plus
i'll clarify it here
i'll retire my position and initiate to the buddhism
lord but this is
i let you know and prepare for it
lord
call dr mok privately
yes
lord remove your order this is nonsense
i know what you mean executive but conceal it
lord find the truth and wreak prince's grudge
just assume it's all my fault
i don't want to my sons's death any more
i don't even know his face
he didn't even receive my love
i don't want him to be killed because of me
that's my last wish
lord please discern it
i can't accept this lord
i have nothing more to say prepare the resignation
what i have to go
where are you going  i'm gonna run
he's initiating in buddhism why are you gonna run
you people have no brains how can you survive here
why what's happening
initiating in buddhism means he will do the adication
abdication to who unknown fourth son
not him his brother premier
what really
so we have to pack pack your stuff
would it happen just like the last time
you lost your husband from it
and still don't know
oh my gosh
no way no way i have to ask my mom
i'll take care of your mom
sir mack dosoo
if he's abdicating it why didn't he say to abdicate
instead he would initiate in buddhism
from his perspective they harmed the prince
how can he announce to abdicate to them
so it means what it is
i think it is
then what happens to the doctor
he has to resign
what i meant was would resign do all
there isn't any guarantee that it won't happen again
well  please order us
where do we have to go this time
mother do we have to flee again
here comes the doctor
doctor is this true
is the king abdicating the throne to primier
he only mentioned to prepare for his initiation
that's what it is
if it's true
you have to avoid yourself
doctor let's not flee too late like the last time
we have to do it early very early
it's not too late to hand over when next master is selected
don't panic and wait
it's time to panic
father i truly congratulate you
congratulation primier
congratulation
i appreciate it but the order wasn't to abdicate
no it means he will hand over the throne
you can comply it
he just doesn't want to say it
but still
after the mourning of prince he can order it officially
and you can follow process of the abdication
congratualtion  congratulation
congratulation
it's during the national mourning so i can't express it
but i truly congratulate you
your effort gets the outcome finally
thank you all
thank you
i feel bad about not terminating the fourth son
do you feel it too  yes we have to plan it
the reason why he acts like this is that
he wants to conceal it a kind of negotiation
yes i think so
but we gained the biggest thing
isn't that more important to us
if we push him too far he can change thigns around
so why don't we settle things at here
yes that's good
i'll keep pursue the matter of fourth son
don't you worry
but i don't feel ease about him
is he still sleeping  yes
look at me for a second  yes
what
is that true
did the king say he will initiate in buddhism
that's what i heard
how how
don't you need to wake up jang
i'd like to leave him for now
anyway we have to send them gifts
what gifts
nobles and merchants treated the order as abdication
so gifts are sent and party is held now
during prince's mourning
even if so they are making it a firm statement
we can'tjust watch this
you take care of this
welcome welcome
oh my
what's this  it's precious jewels
jewels
did you come
have you been well  yes
bring it  yes here
it's so heavy what is it
it's very special gift so tell him about it
a special gift can i have a look little bit
you wouldn't know what to do with it
i thank you all to come to congratulate my father
what are you talking about
we are honored to be here
yes i think so
here stop talking and let's celebrate
wait the main is the father
father you need to drink first
yes please
thank you all let's drink
start the music
now i'm looking at here they look like a couple
don't you think so father
yes they look very good
you're a younger sister in the house
and you're a solid doctor in the palace
but now you're old enough to be married
yes
taehaksa will do all things about abdicaiton
yes i know
so you have to change the master of taehaksak tomorrow
to who
when father gets abdicated
you'll have to take care of big affairs
so let dr giroo take care of taehaksa
dr mok rasoo will resign himself
so entrust the whole abdication to dr giroo
sir general  don't be humble
who would prepare father's abdication if not you
wooyoung open the board of doctor's meeting
and confirm the dr giroo
let's drink  yes
about dr giroo whose son is he
he's not a noble
he was raised by mok rasoo from haneuljae
i don't know his background
i'm sorry sun just recommended him
should i wake him up
no leave him
yes
i heard about abdication
do you have to resign the master
that's generally right
they want to do it fast so i'll be replaced by tomorrow
tomorrow
is danger coming up fast
what the hell do you mean
giroo didn't become the master who is against me
i don't understand it
the 3 board of doctor is our people
let's go to taehaksa
how could this happen
isn't this strange
unless risk my neck who can dissent
who dissented it
it was me
i dissented a vote against dr giroo
i want dr mok rasoo to be
the master of taehaksa continually
you guys need to excuse me
yes
whoever is on the throne taehaksa must do what it should
we have to study and investigate
to be affluent society for people and nation
the crown prince who passed away would agree with me
dr giroo isn't appropriate for the job
i hope you understand my mean
who is it
it was me
you
i know taehaksa well more than you
i deeply considered and decided it
when my father becomes a king dr mok will raise taehaksa right
and be the essential power for my father
can you swear that you really
did it for father truly
yes
you didn't misinterpret what i said last night
misinterpret
i just giroo
he's smart and brilliant he's no power nor the noble
you went too ahead
you come down and dot here
eunjin have you heard it
what  giroo won't be the master
what how
dr wooyoung dissented and that's why
really that's strange
so i mean  isn't that good for us
not quite she should have some reasons
didn't she feel guilty suddenly
when conscience is left from you
it hardly comes back to you
i think so
finding a missing daguther is harder to find losing conscience
right
where is jang
well i don't know
haven't you seen him
no but why are you looking for him
find him now and bring him in my room
she's pretty but her behavior is hateful
me too
where is he in this critical moment
he told me to leave him and i did
what's he doing
sleeping  what
fish is hard to care
i know that's what i'm worried about
did you wake up
yes that was good sleep i feel so fresh
i can leave now
you idiot where do you think you're going
do you know what kind of situation your colleageus are in
it's relevant to me any more
if they want to do it with me i will happily do so
but if they want to stay back i can't help them
traitor
if we leave we leave together if we stay stay together
you can't leave on your own
who allowed you two to see each other
i hardly convinced people to respect you two
and now only you two are ungrateful and leave
we must go together
wherever you are going i'm going with you
that's fine with me
but jang things got weird doctor is being remained
remained did they select a new master
king announced to abdicate meanwhile
so they selected a new master
but dr wooyoung dissented a vote against giroo
so the doctor will be doing it
so will he be doing it what's he gonna do there
why are you angry with us
jang dr wooyoung wants you to come
doctor did you want to see me
doctor did you want to see me you called me
i called you why didn't you come
i don't know why you wanted see me but i got nothing to say
i was so curious when i saw you
don't you fear the death
how come you're so arrogant and cheeky
to my brother and me
don't you truly fear to die
everyone fears to die
then what's the reason f being arrogant
i fear submission more than the death
right seeing your behavior toward my brother
i never thought to submit you to me
what are you trying to say
i won't make you to submit
give me the revenge towards my brother
the anger and sorrow from prince's incident
relieve it through me
i envy your loyalty towards the prince
but i don't expect that
why do you need me and the doctor all of sudden
first your talent and passion are what taehaksa needs
second i don't want my father to be a figure like present king
therefore i need people to oppose him
one is me and another is you
third is
so you need to convince the doctor
what if i refuse
will you take our lives just like the general
i don't need to he'll take care of it
even if you two flee away
he will find you
just like when you were in haneuljae silla
so be alive when you can be
i don't know you may not like it
but you and your brother are the same
so my answer will be the same no
in any circumstances i won't be your man
think about it slowly
i'm not trying to threat you and kill you
i'm trying to accord you and my understanding
so think about it carefully
the third reason i didn't tell you
is taehaksa may be boring without you
he went to see you didn't you meet him
i came to see you
me
what is it
i made a mistake
i didn't know it hurt you so much
as you know giroo will be a big figure
as long as his background isn't mentioned he's got all
so don't misunderstand me
and i want you to know my effort
do you know what mok did on the coronation 10 years ago
it's the past
no to be exact dr mok didn't do that
you imputed it on to him
do you think that weird sound of crying and windstorm
are just coincident of nature
do you think taehaksa is able to do that
i'm the taehaksa people
although taehaksa has the great technology
but those things cannot be done anyhow
that's why i'm anxious
that's why i don't want him to care about the abdication
what makes you so anxious
the situation is different
you have me and giroo in taehaksa
and all nobles and 6 officials are in your hands
that sort of behavior
makes us to be small
we're not trying to take the throne we're the throne now
move largely and think broadly
a king will be in the glory
but king's impatient will bear the anger and it will bear disgrace
disgrace king will bear sadness and sadness bears mistake
king of disgrace king of disgrace
lord lord  revenge this disgrace
if king seonghwang is the king of disgrace
then king of sadness is the present king
the man who was born mistakenly from him
perhaps fourth son
did it really match the time you found the oracle
and king got seodong's mother preganant
that's right
and seodong was the only one who burned the incense
that's correct
it can be coincident with extreme miracle
or the oracle can be meaningless writing
however
if the incense burner was given to me and yeon gamo
got pregnant king's baby and jang became a disciple
if these all mean something
you have received a mandate from heaven
that's right to enthrone jang as the king
if it is so i won't leave here with jang
and i mustn't leave
i have to accept dr wooyoung's proposal i have to be here
but what makes you worried
what seems to stop you
why is jang chosen
althought it is the oracle
i hope there's a reason for me to accept it
no since the oracle was given to me
a reason must be clarified
how come prince aja didn't receive the mandate
but jang did
what prince didn't have but jang has
so that it makes baekjae prosperous
which jang must have
there must be the one
until i find it i won't make any decision
the reason why i'm telling you is
i know if it's true that he was given the mandate
i'll have to behave differently
right  i understood
like you said why it has to be him
the mandate prince aja didn't receive
i'll consider the reason why it was given to him
if it's clear enough i'll conduct with you
it must be wrong
like wooyoung said i must be thinking too much
why is it jang
what's his thing to arouse baekjae
is this really unavoidable path to duke seodong
unavoidable
we should flee did you forget about 10 years ago
how can we forget that
but why are you just watching the doctor
we're conving him
it's uneasy that dr wooyoung acts like that
yes it'll be late
but this time they are trying to
proceed the abdication to primier
they don't want blood sheded
but we don't know how things can change
and specially we don't know about general
that's what i mean
i'll go to the merchant and search
where we can go and boat we can use secretly
please you two persuade the doctor
doctor
what makes you linger
jang
even if dr wooyoung will guarantee our security
that won't be real guarantee
you should come with me we have to hurry
are you doing this because of me
yes i am
i already let it go
who my father is and who i am
i forgot it already
no it was an order from the king
it wasn'tjust given to me it was given to you as well
so don't make excuse out of me
if you still want to leave behind
i only can think of you have the lingering
of being the master here
i'll preapre the place and time to go
so you know this
what is his thing
what do heavens need his thing
have you decided yet
i can't say i don't have any motive but you and your people
are crucial resources of taehaksa and i mean it
now i'm becoming the princess of baekjae
i think you'll be the distributor of baekjae's prosperity
but my brother doesn't think that way
we don't have enough time decide quickly
yes
if this is because of me you don't have to do this
how dare you underestimate him
so please don't make the dangerous decision
dangerous
do think he's the dangerous person
it's not that he's dangerous because he oppose the general
unless you're protesting because of me
if you ever thought of something else
it's dangerous
no it's too early
why are you not making a decision
what do you think about jang
why all of sudden
you always mentioned he's unstable and dangerous
he's impulsive and stubborn and he has no boundary
boundary
surely he's smart his scale and determination is outstanding
and he's chivalrous and loyal
but he can't be control within the group
he caused the benefiting enemy and
seeing a silla woman
we as taehaksa people never thought of that
he has different boundary of thinking to us
but why about jang
he's not the problem you are
why don't you listen to me
he has no boundary
why are you doing this
until the doctor makes no decision i'm not leaving
it's dangerous
the reason they asked him to stay
is because of their good
when general decides the same massacre can happen
10 years ago and i'm worried about this
this is what i decided i'm letting you know
that man are you sure
are you sure you sold that many
did you sell all the fish
yes i should've done it earlier
it was pain in my ass if you couldn't
sell it within 2 days
how did you sell it  i tied in yam with it
you did tiedin sale
yes i purchased cheap yams and tied in
then it was sold out instantly
profit got reduced but it's great that you solved this
yes i think i should do this often
don't do that next time
if yams were scattered seodongs will starve for few days
and i have starved myself because of this
what are you talking about
if yams were tied in for free
nobody buys yams from seodong
so it cuts off poor children's living unintentionally
i never thought of that
you guys are from nobles you wouldn't know this
please do i as wish
what are you looking
something tedious like you why
why am i tedious and worthless
uncle aren't pig's guts worthless
it is worth you can blow it and play kicking
or you can put grained bean to use it as bomb
how about tail
i use it to surprise people
uncle what do you do with this
no you put water in and draw a line
you can see how much time has gone
thunder how about thunder
it gives you get punished from heaven
human's dot how about dot
no it's useful
someone in my town found a daughter who was lost
this was it this was it
jang is so smart
but he always investigates this worthless thing
what is it
yes he gave me this as if he was giving me his last will
did he  yes
he investigated himself
if you shiled neck and head a cold can be reduce in half
i don't think it's important
one day ms mojin asked us to
make clothings to seal the cold
and he didn't study the clothes
it says anything that shields neck and head you know
fur is the best clothing to protect the cold
but straw can protect it as well
when you put straw between the cotton it will contain air
then you thread to make clothes it maintains the warm
we have the duty of security of our technology
if i took the weapon's method i'd understand
but they were dying from damp disease
they're people of silla
people of silla and baekjae they are all people
but the practicer has the country
the study of nature shouldn't have any border
from the result baekjae lost superiority of diplomacy
and wealth and power from the ondol
in the end you helped the enemy
but the patient lived in the end i helped a human
doctor jin gakyung wants to see you
alright
answer seems to be easy
i think so
crown prince i and you
always have emphasized it which we couldn't have
because he was born mistakenly he could have it
he's not an imperial for people he is the people himself
right people don't care about silla or baekjae
they need happy and easy life
yes
he didn't think about extursion of technology
no matter where people are from he cared about the sickness
yes
when most of engineers thought to make protected clothes
by fur and silk for imperial family
he thought of shielding neck and head would be less cold
he's the people himself he doesn't need to think
he can apply his experience on it
that's why heaven chose him
that harmonize with the spirit of baekjae
it's a mandate to arouse baekjae again
doctor please follow my mean
i don't know what lingers you here
i lost to me without fighting each other
then admit your defeat it's a manner to disappear quickly
do i have to hurt you
or make a situation to run away
tell the king
lord went to junghwajung
why there  i don't know
i'm sorry i'm sorry
this place is
the first place king met yeon gamo 20 years ago
lord
what's the matter
before you leave here please look around taehaksa once
why
i wanted to show you something
i made it hard and crown prince favored it very much
let's go
we're here lord
what is it nothing's here
that is it
isn't that jang
yes lord
what i made hard and crown prince favored is jang
he's your fourth son and the prince of baekjae jang
what
i made it hard and crown prince favored it very much
isn't that jang
he's your fourth son and the prince of baekjae
jang  what
he's the son of yeon gamo
not knowing that i told him to not show up
i told him i wan't even sorry for him
you loved the princess
you must love the position
because you can't do it for yourself
you couldn't even glance it with the right way
the fight between you and me i win against to you
it's interesting fight that even if you win i still win it
i don't know where and how it got wrong
how long would my mistake will go
now i'm afraid
what do i have to do what should i do
lord please calm yourself
when did you know this
i found out not long ago
were you with jang since the haneuljae
yes lord
how how did it happen
when i was chased to silla
yeon gamo asked me to take care of the prince
yeon gamo
how do you know her
asking jang to you seems you're quite close to her
how do you know her
before i become a doctor
before i become a doctor
i'm sorry lord
we were meant to marry
lord
i don't know what to say
i can't say anything
lord i mok rasoo am not
saying this to hear you say that
please remove what you've ordered to the fourth prince
please remove that you asked him to forget about prince
although i rebuked yeon gamo the reason why she
sent the prince is to raise him like the prince
i did not know her intention
i couldn't raise the prince like the prince
but he grew up as the prince himself
no because he didn't have imperial education
he grew up like that
he's one of the commoner
he has to live like them he grew up like weeds
instead he won't easily bent and he grew up
as he won't sell his people
so what you have put off
plesae refire the tiny hope of your flame
i understand that you want to
save the last prince you have
if the prince lives after all
he will live to blame his rout just like you lord
that is not saving your prince
but to kill him
the prince hasn't lived like that
if he was in the situation of death and submission
he's always chosen to die
and revived again
i have a belief in him
that he won't be killed ever
and the belief he will arouse baekjae again
so please
please remove your order to forget about everything
lord
that's totally nonsense
is the doctor believing that nonsense incence burner
and the oracle and anguishing now
i told you it's notjust about the oracle you're
the commoner is that the reason of oracle
yes
there are millions of people out there
does it make sense that being commoner is
the reason to enthrone and arouse the nation
that's not it
it's significant that you're an imperial as well as commoner
all politicians say that they are for the people
but they never do that
because they don't know
you don't need to know that
to govern the country
it's not looking after individual's peronal life
it's to organize systems for people to live better lives
i've never had any educations or ability
you can learn the education and nurture your ability
when how
it's useless lingering
then why did you try to reveal yourself
didn't you know what is like to be a prince
i know but the most important thing was
to revenge crown prince's enenmy
i just wanted to let people know
the fourth prince didn't kill him but they did
to achieve what it's destruction not the creation
yes i'm doing it destroy i'm trying to destroy them
duke seodong  creation is not part of my duty
and i don't have ability nor the will
don't ever imagine vain fantasy
i never knew he would believe in such thing
have you heard it
to believe the burner you added the reason of
being commoner i was surprised
jang
i'm surprised that you're telling me nobody like me was given
a mandate from heaven
anyone is born with the mandate
when there's 99 of will and effort
a single mean of heaven is important
that's why fate means to work hard
yes but the throne is different
the man has to do very different things
when the throne is moved to wrong lineage
there will be a lot of blood shed
that's an excuse and lingering
even if you're right
now i don't have a single will of my own
i'll forget it i'll completely forget it
crown prince and lord i will forget them
and i will make my mandate myself
lord is here
jang
jang
i'm very sorry
i denied you when you were in front of me
i already engraved your order in my heart
jang
i forgot about it
so you should forget it lord
jang i denied you because
i don't blame that you denied me
i only resent you
because you folded to wreak prince's grudge
it's very rude to say
but i can't accept that
you don't have right to be sorry for prince and me
you've never shown your effort to save your princes
or to raise baekjae right
apart from success and failure you never showed your effort
i don't understand it at all
i'm saying this with my life on the line
jang
just once
call me 'father ' just once
you can do what you want to do
i'll do what i need to do
even if you're imperial or doctor
it's not a manner to come into someone else's room
please get out
10 days later my father will be the throne
what kind of position do you want
i'm thinking of the secretary who manages imperial order
how about eunsol for you under my authority
and i'll give you land servants and private men
i want to take military police managing info and soldiers
but my brother won't concede to me
let go
after abdication when king initiates in buddhism
what do you think my brother will do to you and dr mok
so far you have seen and experience him
what do you think he'll do
people don't bent over because they wanted to
if it's that simple the world would be boring
so don't think about it as good and evil
judge it as profit and loss
then the world is an interesting place to live
after abdication when king initiates in buddhism
what do you think my brother will do to you and dr mok
so far you have seen and experience him
what do you think he'll do
what you're leaving
yes captain i'm sorry
what a man are you where do you think you're going
i'm sorry i can't explain to you all
so decide now i won't force you
jang
i understood you please wait a little
why is he acting weird recently
you need to wait
it's not that i can talk about it
but he just said he's leaving
and you said you're going with him
he can't leave here
he can't do that
i will do whatever to change his mind
so you need to take care of here when i'm away
that's what i've been doing
i hope he's not going to sangdaepo
and off to persia or soo
well i don't know but would he do that
he's not looking good
anyway if we're going to other country
i can't go
why not
firstly i don't speak persian
and i'll die if i can't speak
didn't you say that when you came from baekjae
that's not the same
and another important thing  why because of bumro
did you know
you don't have to worry about a thing
why
if you leave he'll be very pleased
lady
the snowman we made got ugly
don't you want to make it again before we go
oh my yourjoke doesn't work
i'm so hungry
we're alright but you must be tired lady
he's too harsh
i'm alright
you don't have right to be sorry for prince and me
you've never shown your effort
to save your princes
or to raise baekjae right
apart from success and failure you never showed your effort
i don't understand it at all
doctor
we're ready can we leave now
have a seat  yes
i'm sorry to all of you but i can't leave here
doctor what are you saying
will you accept dr wooyoung's proposal
that's nonsense
you'll be ostensible for a master
the abdication is already in progress by dr wooyoung
that won't be the case  right
you won't do that then
whatever happens i'll assist the king until the end
after abdication i'll follow the king to the temple
and whatever happens afterward
escorting the king with guard wanggoo
is the my duty
doctor
so you need to leave
you'll be marked as my people and go through hard times
i'm sorry that i couldn't protect you
doctor
where is jang in this critical moment
yes you guys go and find jang
yes  yes
i can't protect you
what will you do
i wasn't leaving
i'll follow the doctor
that can't happen
i will also do that
you can do that
but ms mojin needs to go with me it's reasonable
either for your body and for your future
you need to take eunjin and bumro
ms mojin
loyalty isn't everything in this world
did i hear it in my dream
or did jang say this
but where the hell is he where is jang
what he left here
yes  he's really vicious
without saying a word to us
no way he went to look for a place to stay
well it didn't look like it
no
i don't know his story but he seems to be hurt
he reckons he's the only one
my heart is hurt for 4 seasons long
don't you know where he left to
he said he's going to persia
persian
eunjin
this isn't right this is betrayal and revolt
we have to get him jang jang
i have a place to stop by
is it wangryong temple
let's go
initiation is 7 days later and abdication is nearly prepared
but how come he hasn't announced it yet
yes i considered his sad mind
so i didn't talk about the abdicaiton
it's been delayed too long
but i can't go and ask him about it
what do we do shall we convene the meeting
yes we should do that
although he mentioned he will initiate in buddhism
he didn't order us to abdicate his throne
if this preparation continues it'll be treason
yes we have to conclude it
i'll see him
will you do that
yes
lord
the felon who harmed prince will be executed quietly
certainly it's right thing to find the fourth prince
who assassinated the prince with the felon
that will expose the private matter of imperial
so please permit this
what is this
the list of people who will attend and abdication schedule
and for any unknown threat from other nation
and consipiracy of fourth son it's the statement
for requesting military police to guard in the palace
you're not allowed to bring military police in the palae
please approve it
i see you can leave it
sun
yes lord
do you want to be a king that badly
if you become the one what do you want to do
when i'd became a crown prince
my father king seonghwang asked me this question
well i think i had ambition of myself
i had one
what's the worth to reminisce the old days
it's just useless
what's the reason you wanted to abdicate the throne
didn't you ask him to raise the collapsed baekjae
the general who lost his motive and conspired with nobles
didn't you ask him to take baekjae from him
because you meant that
he knew it was unfilial and had fear of death
he accepted the abdication
he told me he will go through any circumstances
how come you trample prince's will and remove it from him
crown prince was different
he told me that he will protect the lord
and third prince who passed away
and security of fourth prince you haven't seen
but these have to be done by you
and you had to be the bridge of it
did he give you the permission
he will do it soon his mind is totally bent over
wooyoung said the preparation is going well
is it  yes
although she said certain things
but he excluded dr mok from the preparation of it
and just reported to him
everything is done by me and her
so you don't have to worry about a thing
alright
what's this
it's a book of execution list
execution list
after abdication is held these people need to be terminated
straight after the abdication
that's right
that approves we usurped the throne by ourselves
then do we leave the rebellions
we must be the period not now
yes i think so
you're gonna kill anyone
i have to think about it selecting people is vital for now
have you prepared rough outline
yes
from the given information i recommended positions
wooyoung is the secretary this is heavy responsibility
that will negotiate without any trouble
but  the most vital is
the secret storage and documents of the imperial
from your information it doesn't tell me where it is
after the abdication it'll naturally be handed over to premier
right it won't come to me
yes it'll tranfer to premier
then dr wooyoung and the queen will
right i have check it before hand
otherwise wooyoung will preoccupy it
yes
you release the soldiers and check it out quietly
yes
and sir please let jangdoo go
yes i will take care of it
yes
this is the last thing i will do
after the initiation i'll bring king and doctor here
and i'll leave
that i will just do that
if you decided go back to palace and escort him
after the abdication they might do it
on the way to here
it's possible during the abdication
although imperial guards are there their numbers lack
blank
are you sure jang has to escort me safely
so he went to see the priest
yes lord
i haven't done anything for him
but he still couldn't leave me
blank
blank
secure jangdoo  jangdoo
they'll execute him but it won't be true
so secure jangdoo without exposing to sun
what will you do
i'll tell you later
deal with it first
and tell dr mok to visit me
yes
what is it
we arrested them to intrude the storages at night
how could military police can intrude to imperial palace
look imperial guard
i only followed the general's order
general's order
rebellions may intrude through the abdication
so he ordered me to inspect all storages
what
it doesn't make sense that military police got into palace
when you're not allowed to enter here
you searched the all storages and the imperial storage
yes he ordered it clearly
get up
what
did you order it already
no general is releasing his forces in the palace
what
they will see our every move
i see
convene the meeting soon
gye will step forward and receive doctorine
this is the doctorine that i will abdicate to him
lord
as the general planned it the abdicaiton will be held
4 days later at 6 o'clock
prepare it well
yes lord
i have things to discuss with premier
so rest of you can dismiss
yes lord
you may be disappointed that i didn't officially clarify it
no i didn't
i'm exhausted understand me
i know how could i not know it
gye
personally you're my brother
yes lord
although you may be in different position
we've been through the death of our father
and you've seen my pain
yes lord
i lost all my sons and what greed would i have
but you still don't trust me
and do military police have to intrude to my place
what are you talking about
i'm afraid
i've never slept well
please let me enthrone you
and stay quietly until i will resign
please take those soldiers out of the palace
i will just wander around the garden until the abdication
brother
that's my last wish as your brother
brother
sun
yes father
did you intrude imperial's storage by military soldiers
it wasn't intruding i told them to inspect
for unknown situation at the abdication
imperial's storage
that's the private domain for king and queen
and it'll be inherited to father at the abdication
why are you inspecting those places
what's your intention
intention  if it's not the intention
how come you didn't ask for a permission
and do something like that
will you do that after father becomes the king
she's right
although we may be separated from the throne
but he's still my older brother
i want to escort him comfortably
so take those soldiers out
he doesn't have power now do you get it
yes i understand
dismiss all soldiers in the palace
pardon  what are you saying
wooyoung and father were very offended
about inspecting imperial storage with soldiers
i don't want to be accused wrongly
it's better to emphasize on selecting people
yes sir  yes
pardon prepare that
yes i'll do what i can do
i have to show my son a piece of will before i die
so bring jang
but jang is
he's in wangryong temple
wangryong temple

military soldiers can't even come here
how could private men enter here

we have a problem lord
why  while we were escorting sir bu yeogye
heuk came with his private men
what  you have to avoid now
yes you must avoid lord
are nobles and officials at the hall
but  i'll go there
and proclaim the abdication script of prince mookang
lord it's dangerous
it will secure his lineage for the future
lord  that was my least will
even if i failed it i must do that
that is enough for me
so you go to dr mok
the mission is failed and i ran away
and escape them with planned exit
yes
it's been already an hour
now it's over there are several foot steps
surely it's the servants who will escort you officially
guard here thoroughly
please go in
what happened
shh
what has happened
lord cheated on us
cheat
lord called general secretly last night
and assassinated him with a poison knife
what assassinate
are you sure is this real  yes
what about general is he alright
he penetrated out of the death
and went to medicine storage of taehaksa
he fortunately ate the detoxified medicine and he's alive
what do i do with this
where is sun now
i was contacted not long ago
so i came here to protect you
with my men immediately
so please don't worry
general will command the military police
sweep them away all of them
let's go  yes
let officials hear it
soon the lord will recite the abdication script
doesn't it feel strange
yes i feel it
what's going on
lord it's dangerous please you have to go
but this i got to read this
no you have to go now
what are you doing escort the lord now
yes  lord
find the lord
find lord and take his life  yes
how dare you
have you packed the box  yes lord
i prepared as you ordered me
what about prince is he safely escaped
i think so so you need to go now lord
i see  let's go
are you alright  yes what about father
he's safe
the king was trying to do something at the abdication
go and get the script
yes
are you ok general
that old fox fooled us
sir general sir general
what is it  look at this
what is it
the abdication script is script is
it's named as prince mookang
what find him he must be in the palace
whatever he is find him find him
sir general sir general
i'll take care of general
dalsol you need to shut down the whole palace
alright ok escort him
shut down the entire palace
espcially you go to taehaska and shut down and find him
yes follow me  yes
move it
what has happened here
why are you so late
i thought you were gone to heaven
are you ready
yes let's hurry  let's go
from now on taehaksa is shut down
until the next order is placed  what
stay in your workshop and don't move
prince didn't come here what's going on
here comes baekmoo
what happened
things happened
things
unexpectedly sir bu yeogye escaped to the shrine
dr mok and prince
can't come out of a secret room
what
are they exposed
fortunately no
they don't know about the secret room there
then what should i do
lord there is another anxiety
what is it
the hidden jangdoo knows the face of prince
if heuk chipyung find him
damn it i have to return to the palace
lord
we'll go in
you
yes lord we'll take them out of the palace
we dressed the private soldiers so they can't distinguish us
so you can follow the guards
it's rude to say but if you're here
we can't concentrate our power in one place
so please go with guard
and let us be responsible here
crown prince mookang
what mookang when did he invest the crown prince
what mookang when did he invest the crown prince
and enthrone the prince
i found the script at the abdicatoin hall
oh my how could he
so i'm looking for king and prince
but i can't find them yet
how could my brother do this
we waited and waited for normal process of abdicaiton
yes it's worse than using soldiers quietly
have you found him  it's not that
what
imperial guards are coming back to attack
imperial guards
they came to save you
didn't soldiers surround the palace
yes but they did
where did they reinforce the soldiers
i don't think they did
if not how could they come back
they must have reinforced
anyway concentrate the military soldiers here
and defend here  yes
what should we do  isn't it better to go out
this is the safest place
but to stay here isn't
i'll find if there's other door
i found a door here
is it locked
it looks like it  make soldier to open it
yes
find if there's a big wood
yes
sir general  why
the reason why small numbers of guards attack
maybe
it's the 4th prince it means he's here
right right
break it break it he's here
break it  yes
we repulsed them  really
no troops are coming
yes it's suicide squad i don't think more will come
damn it i lost him in front of my eyes
thank you  don't say that
we can't delay any more
how about the lord
he's safe you two can come with me
chase them find them now
find them if you have to search the castle or whole baekjae
does it mean general killed prince aja
it says so that's why king punished him
what happened to the abdication
i was in front of the palace looking at it
it was strange
strange
suddenly military soldiers intruded into the palace
and high officials ran out of the palace
then this must be true
yes i heard that too
what really happened  you know
sir general killed prince and he tried to do abdication
but king disagreed so he intruded in
is that what it is
by the way who won
i don't know about that but soldiers guarding the palace
are military police i think  what
then did general chop off the king
that's total nonsense
lower your voice
how did it go
as soon as soldiers are released people took it off
and reading it
there's no problem spreading rumors
what about palace what happened to the palace
military police are guarding the main gate
what military police secured it
yes soldiers are walking around the market
it doesn't look good
i should've followed the owner
what do i do what if he gets in trouble
lady jin it's me
what about lord why isn't he here
first have a seat
captain
this is courtesy i have to do
king ordered a thing please be seated
here
i'll go to a safer place
but you have to something in the castle
for my and your security
what's in the chest is needed for this work
can we go out now
no they'll guard the taehaksa continually
don't panic
and do not leave your workshop
what's happening now
where are those soldiers going
lord doctor and prince seemed they left here safely
so they're gathering soldiers to find them
what about jang i don't see him around
maybe jang guards the doctor
it should be dangerous
then are we safe here
well that's
you all know what we have done
the moment you talked about it we're all dead
if you want to live you mustn't talk anything about it
and we had our duties at the abdication
so we won't be suspected
plus if they ask about doctor
well we really don't know what he's up to
anyway in any circumstances we strongly
strongly  woosoo
why are you crying
that that
why
the people who guided at the door
soji juriyoung lady gooksu
why what happened
as soldiers intruded in they all died
what  dead
what have they done wrong
what have they done wrong
king and 4th prince don't seem to be in the palace
our soldiers have secured whole palace
that's not the problem
what do we do about abdication
we have to force it tomorrow
but we have no royal script and in front of everyone
military police intruded into palace
we can dominate with power but it's not that simple
and nobles will resist to it
i have to drive 4th prince to a treason
can it be done  that's the only way we have
you escort the father  yes
you quietly find the royal seal
and make the script saying my father will be enthroned
yes
what happened
i think there are influence to slander the abdication
but still military police intruded palace in front of people
people would look at it as revolt of general
revolt what do you mean
i'm talking about the people's perspective
you have heard
unclarified existence of 4th prince
that 4th prince
killed prince aja and made me like this
and he tried to kill the king and premier
i found out this and stopped it
what about the king
he left a royal script saying he will enthrone to premier
he secretly left to the temple
therefore at the nobles meeting
you can confirm the abdication to premier
honestly
this is the notice attached at the market
it says general killed prince aja
and king punished you
what how could nonsense notice
this is the act of 4th prince
the problem is that this was attached by king's order
and people are reading it and it's spreading
if you force the abdication people will accept it as usurpation
what shoud we do
looking at general's behavior
king didn't seem to die
yes
the tendency seems to be general but signs are not good
what would you do
wouldn't king go to jinryu in achak
he would fight back with jinryu's minimum private soldiers
then
the tendency is leaning to general
but i don't think we should rush the choice
how the hell did you let them attach it all over the place
i'm sorry
it's not to blame dalsol
it's hard to catch a thief with 10000 soldiers
what do we do
it'll be usurpation if we force it or if we don't
i will have to force it
if we force it without the royal script
we've disadvantage on fight with nobles
they think something else if we give them time
i must force it to disguise the script
have you found the royal seal  it's gone
what do you mean
it wasn't at its storage or king's bedroom or palace
then
king king did
king took it with him
you confronted this unimaginable situation
i'm very resentful
you don't have to be
i should've done this from the beginning
i did it too late that's why it happened
but lord
you're here
if you order suburban nobles to bring their private soldiers
they will come
if you can hold on to it
certainly people and heaven will be your side
with your men and minor nobles' men
we can't win over united nobles and soldiers
lord
i have a different goal
because the royal seal is still with me
these are loyal nobles to general
even if it was sealed by royal seal
they won't follow king's order
no they won't
then what's the reason that king asked me to do this
don't you get it
this is to make sacrifice for you
one is he couldn't clarify you at the abdicaiton
it's for that
second is nobles don't have absolute loyalty
so he's providing a reason to oppose to general
this will make you a sacrifice afterward
sacrifice
yes lord is only thinking about
how to be your sacrifice
lord
how to use the sacrifice is now up to you
nobles should be still staying at the castle sabi
yes they should
do you know how important this is
yes  don't get exposed
without missing one person you have to succeed it
yes i checked their movement
so don't worry about it
if you're exposed by military
you have to let us know first
yes  rush it
lord i know what you mean
i will achieve it i will achieve it
nobles are here
escort them in
have you all received it  yes
it says kill general sun and enthrone crown prince mookang
another one is to send private troops to achak
what should we do
seeing the royal seal of king
general doesn't have the royal seal with him
this shows us the 4th son's plot is a lie
and it's also lie that king left abdication script to them
i didn't trust this
the problem is king has no intention to resign
this can cause a internal war
internal war would put general's hand up
then  anyway this script will be
the gain to us after following situation
except hae noted 7 family must gather the power
so don't make your move easily and watch what happens
don't we need to alert to general
well shouldn't we assist the king first
but considering the power it's too obvious
that general will be enthroned
that's what sir sa is thinking
and if nobody reveals this
no danger will be alerted
assassinate general and enthrone crown prince mookang
prince mookang
what are you thinking
i hope he's not telling us to enthrone who we don't know
i don't think so
but the existence of prince mookang
feels that he will strenghten our power
anyway general and premier don't have the royal seal
the seal king and prince has
i'm thinking of sending baekmoo to japan
to japan
yes prince seongduk of japan
has very close relationship with prince aja
if we tell him the situation he'll help us in diplomacy
how did it go
yes it's safely sent to all nolbes
and they have gathered except hae and buyeo
they might discuss the profit and loss
there is no other way
there is no other way
then what can you do without the royal seal
can you forge the royal seal
can you do it
i can do this
but if forged seal is revealed
our movement will be immobile
still this is the way
nobles don't know about the seal's traces
conduct the abdication quickly
and destruct king and jinryu with king's order
sir general we have a problem
come in
what brought you here
what assassinate me and enthrone prince mookang
i never knew king would do a such thing
assassination
there's nothing to be waited
arrest all nobles who saw this script didn't report
and enforce the abdication
do you want nobles to turn our back
right they know the seal is missing
and we can't afford to have internal war with them
then what's your plan
would you be inveigled by king
or do you want
me to be assassinated by nobles
lord is only thinking about
how to be your sacrifice
how to use the sacrifice is now up to you
we have to capture the king alive
we capture the king and find the seal and do abdication
are you saying to strike jinryu
conciliation is first but if it won't work
we have to do that
will conciliation work
he'll think about his family's future
where prince aja is gone now
why did you want horse for
we're going to achak
dr mok sent a message
what does it say
he sent my scripts to nobles
and baekmoo is sent to japan
that's great
certainly prince seonduk will be our strength
yes lord i sent messages to family of gokna and jomi
to send their private troops their responds will come soon
lord you need to hang on to it
my and gokna's troops aren't
as good as other nobles
but people are on our side
stay strong lord
sir executive jomi sent a message
oh did he
see lord our power will extent
are you sent by jomi tajoong  yes
right did you bring the letter
he wanted to talk to you privately
he came here then why didn't he come in
it's not a suitable place he wanted to see you outside
aren't a doctor of taehaksa
i'm the secret envoy of general now
i'll repeat it you only have one day
if you pull this off nicely the position of premier
and the power of yeon's region
will be returned to you all
so just escort a company of king to palace
what if i refuse to do so
private troops of general and hae also military soldiers
will be ordered mobilized
you have one day
lord you don't look good
i regret my old days
why couldn't i be more brave i regret it
proper owner of the royal seal i had powerjust for that
why was i so afriad
after death is casted aside i feel so relieved
lord it's not too late now
i know it's reckless
after all jinryu's power will be pulled out
and i will be disappeared
but now
what i can do for prince mookang is just this
for prince mookang
i only can inform his lineage
enduring a day
one person one noble get to know him
enduring 2 days 2 people 2 nobles
enduring 100 days
100 people and 100 nobles need to know him
lord
i'm sorry for jinryu
who showed unlimited loyalty
but that's all i can do for now
lord
but i thank him
i thank prince mookang
who gave me what i can do for him
so you never know whether it's today or tomorrow
when sun's soldiers come
to fight with us
you must escape
lord that's impossible
must escape
deliver my will to crown prince
and protect him
understood
i said do you understand
yes
i feel tired now
i need to lay down
you go out now
i'll take care of him you can rest today
no
shouldn't you protect him longer
lord it's time to get up
he said he's tired
lord are you sick
he is not
lord
i have no choice
how how could lord lord
otherwise our family is exterminated
lord lord
just leave him
he's escorted the king for his entire life
they're coming
alright let's go
lord is lord is
the lord is arrested on their hands
what
guard wanggoo ran to get him
stop it
release the lord
lord what are you saying
i know all release him
guys
save the king
it's king save the king
lord
i won't be insulted to you easily
lord
you killed my son aja
and tried to kill me i won't forgive you
lord
lord
the crown prince i acknowledge
is only the 4th mookang
lord lord
spread this fact to all people
jang
call me 'father ' just once
lord tell me your imagination of baekjae
tell me prince aja's imagination of baekjae
if i need to learn i will
if i need ability i'll grow it
for my brother for you and for baekjae
i'm very sorry
jang
lord lord
just think of your will
lord i won't cry
release the lord
lord what are you saying
i know all release him
guys
save the king
lord
i won't be insulted to you easily
lord
you killed my son aja
and tried to kill me i won't forgive you
lord
lord
the crown prince i acknowledge
is only the 4th mookang
lord lord
spread this fact to all people
lord lord
just think of your will
lord
i won't cry
i won't cry again
what happened
when guards showed up king pulled out the knife
he mentioned general's name
and he only acknowledge mookang to be the throne
what
until the end until the end
if we leave him like that it'll spread to people rapidly
what do i do
first you order soldiers to remove king's body
and order private troops to strike military soldiers
what
soldies of military police
notjust them strike all people who saw this
pardon
disguise the fight between revolt of 4th son and military
and sweep everything away
but sir general you must think when you'll be the king
if you massacre people it's an indelible stain
it's too late
i came to where i can't turn back
lady lady
what is it what is it
at the market
what about it
oh my oh gosh
king held a knife at the market
king why is he in the market
king just passed away
what
move away
we're military police we will escort the lord
i'll escort him
guard wanggoo will escort him you will guard him
yes
escort lord escort lord
it's the revolt retreat now
retreat now
sir wanggoo sir wanggoo
what's happening doctor
i don't exactly know
disaster is occurred we have to hide now
i'll go first stay here
hide it's the general
lord lord
how this happened lord
who who have they done this to you
lord
lord
brother
king has passed away
what
i can't say it with my mouth
in front of the market
prepare the national mourning
i can't believe this how how could this
it's the 4th prince
you were dazzled by notice and script
finally king has passed away
i acquired information that king will come to the market
and military soldiers went to escort him
but unknown private troops attacked us
therefore
king has passed away
and poor people were sacrificed
i will
i will find him
i will eradicate the sources of evil
all of you prepare the national mourning
national mourning
it's the mourning of the king
prepare it
get out and prepare it
he massacred people
how long can it be hidden
it's too late
i came to where i can't turn back
where he can't turn back where he can't turn back
i'll transfer 2000 private soldiers and 100 horses
they acted military operation at the market in day time
it means 4th son prepared his soldiers
yes that's right
you never know things will change we have to be ready
then i'll treat that you agreed with me
2000 men and 1000 horses
that's more than what i have
this isn't preparing for political change
it is to weaken our strength
the situation is bad
transfer of private men is the only right of king
even if it's emergency situation
hand over private men without the script of king
this has never happened in history
because of 4th son's treason abdication hasn't been done
you're the master of board of nobles
why don't you stand on our side and take general's side
anyway before we see the scirpt with the royal seal on it
we can't hand over our men
is this it  yes

without any suspicion i thought it was the royal seal

then only king and guard went to achak
correct  didn't mok rasoo and 4th son go with him
yes just the king
alright you can go
even if it turned this way what you promise is
how can you say that now
still promise is promise
and you shouldn't treat me like this

what brought you here
i know your anxiety for consecutive tragedy
why is everything alright
it's not that do you know a man called giroo
dr giroo why
he impended my house with soldiers
did he
i don't know well but don't you trust me
it's nothing like that
do you think i can't read the situation
and panic now
i told you it's not like that
maybe he was looking for dr mok rasoo
dr mok rasoo
i met him a couple of times for supplying goods in taehaksa
but he's nothing to do with me
if the store is inspected by military
it would have huge impact
i had officials from soo and i was very unbearable
it wasn't intended and i'm sorry
you're watching my back so please look after me little more
i won't make you regret especially to you princess
to me
yes isn't it time for you to collect your own people
when you need me please tell me
what's the reason
after abdication was decided
i sent many gifts to sir general
but i felt it's not right thing to do
isn't premier becoming the king
and i have worry as a merchant
what is it
merchant abigi is assisting general irrationally
i think he's restraining my store
and he's close to dr giroo
handle it quick quick
