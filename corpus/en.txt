i had a choice between our family and paying them down .
were supposed to make decisions together .
would you have made anything different .
alice , we cant make it rain together turn the dust into grass .
we cant stop hollander from selling our land to the railroad either .
its too bad the doctors at the aid station didnt take much of my leg . i read that the pension act pays by the pound now .
stop looking at me like that .
are you going to tell the marshal what those men did .
marshal aint doing shit william .
first thing , mark . im going to take you boys . were going to round up the herd . then im going into town .
what are you going to do there .
im going to tell hollander to make this right .
im going to tell him to pay for a new barn .
maybe we should just shoot him like will says .
coach is headed for bigsby , boss .
girded with iron , on top , double shotguns . and a gatling .
you should have let me save the feed .
ar you going to hock that .
some day , william , .
when you walk in my shoes you might understand .

i hate pinkertons .
byron mcelroy .
when did your hair turn gray , byron .
go to hell , ben wade .
well , will you look at all this . you all spared no expense this time , byron .
ive got to say , thought . its probably cheaper just to let me rob the damn thing .
if you are going to kill me , just as soon get to it .
i aint going to kill you .
not like this .
it wont change a thing , if you let me live .
ill come for you .
id be disappointed if you didnt .
shes lit shes lit .

there we go .
im going to ask you to put down the money . step back . tell them to step back or this man will die .
not a smart move , friend .
shit .
hes fast .
well , tommy . it seems that there was a pinkerton inside that coach that wasnt quite dead .
now , i know what charlie told you , because we dont got but a few rules in this outfit .
this is what happens when you put us all at risk .
mark , look at me . keep looking at me . back up quietly .
william , look at me .
good morning .
those are my cattle . i want them back .

they are all that ive got .
i dont need your cattle , but i will be needing them horses .
so you dont go doing nohing , foolish .
take the horse .
find them on the road to bigsby . boys .
theyre probably just running late , mr . butterfield .
pinkertons dont run late . thats why theyre paid 18 dollars a day .
get me on my feet .
i think youre in pretty bad shape , mr . just get me on my damned feet .
mark , williams , get me some of them boards .
can i help you .
i think maybe a coach headed for here got itself held up in a canyon about 10 miles back .
by mr ben wade himself .
how did you know it was wade .
its been him the last 21 times , marshal .
i saw a mexican sharpshooter and an apache .
did you see the hand of god whats that .
his pistol why the hell didnt you do something .
they had a lot of weapons , mr . and they were shooting bullets .
lets go , were wasting time .
where are you from anyway .
lets go com on , boys .
hmmm . something is going on with the railroad man .
madame , some whisky for my friends .
lets go , the bar is closed .
heres to the 4 that we lost in battle .
and heres to the boss who had to say goodbye to tommy darlen today .
and thats too bad .
proverbs 13:3 .
he that keepeth his mouth , keepeth his life . he that opens his lips too wide , shall bring about his own destruction .

i dont mind skinny girls as long as theyve got green eyes to make up for it .

thats right , they to be green .
do you think they lied do you think they stole our horses .
they dont need our shit horses . watch your mouth .
ill take him into town on my own .

mr , were going to have to lift you up to get you on top of that horse .
here comes the cavalry .

the only one that made it .
mr . mcelroy , can you hear me it was ben wade .
can you hear me .
this man needs attention .
did you see which way they rode , evans .
it seemed like they were headed to bigsby .
you know , there is a little town just south of the border .
pretty little pueblo down by the river .
folks would pay good money to hear a white woman sing .
yeah , imagine me shinning on down to mexico with ben wade on my arm .
im not wanted in mexico . jump out that back windows with me now .
youre crazy .

mr . hollander .
tucker , im going to the saloon .

its my land .
come next week its not , evans you borrowed a good deal of money , and i got a right to recompense .
but you damn up my creek . you shut off my water . how do you expect me to pay off my debt if you .
before water touches your land it resides and flows on mine . and as such , i can do with it as i fucking please . go home and pack up .
here , if you just give me till spring .
i can turn the corner .
sometimes a man has to big enough to see how small he is .
railroad is coming , dan your land is worth more with you off it .
hollander .
you look a little bent , rancher . you come to wake some snakes .
dan , would you like a drink .
no thanks .
you got your horses back , didnt you and your cattle .
yeah , i got my horses back , but you killed two of my herd .
hell , they died for a good cause .
you know , them beasts of yours they woulndt even fetch 100 dollars .
ill tell you what . that should cover it .
how much do you get for a days work .
2 dollars , when i hire out .
there are 2 dollars for a halfday .
you took up my boys time too .
youre right , i did .
anything else you want to get paid for , dan .

crawley , go get the wagon . make sure every weapons weve got is shoot ready .
ill meet you up front of the office .
get him out of here . sure thing .
i think we should shoot him right now .
put a bullet right in his nogging .
if you do that , everybody in this shit piss of a town will be dead by morning .
22 robberies , over 400 thousand dollars in losses more in delays .
the southern pacific will have ben wade convicted in a federal court . hanged .
in public , an example made .
and we will pay to make it happen .
you all notice he didnt mention of the lives ive taken .

good driving , marshal .
remind me not to play poker in this town .
well , marshal , give us a count .
1 2 3 .

first thing .
madam .
byron , an unpleasant surprise .
what happens if they catch the wagon .
well , you saw where his man was . hes still got to go fish the outfit . marshals got a fast rig , they should reach the fort before dawn .
his gang cant do anything in front of the whole sixth cavarly .
did you have something to do with that .
i hope you are proud of yourself .
just doing my job , doc .
thanks , son .
we always wait to say grace .
we dont presume to teach other people manners .
arent we supposed to say grace for murderers too .
grace is for everyone , dear then why dont we say it .
mark , id like to hear it .
god , our father , lord and savior thank you for your love and favor .
please bless this drink and food we pray and bless all who share with us today .
amen .
if my pa wanted to , he could shoot you dead he can shoot a jack rabbit at 50 yards .
shooting an animal is a lot different than shooting a man , son .
not , it isnt not in my opinion .
we can ask byron here . now byron , hes killed dozens of people . men and women and children . miners , apaches .
not a soul ive taken that didnt deserve what theyve got .
every way of a man is right in his own eyes , byron , but the lord ponders the heart .
proverbs 21 .
dan .
you eat more when youre nervous , mr butterfield .
could you cut that for me could you cut that fat out , i dont particularly like the fat at all .
allright .
and the grissle i dont like grissle .
do you mind if i ask you how you got that hitch in your step , dan .
dont tell him nothing , mr evans .
where were you stationed .
7th company of sharpshooters , out of massachusetts .
my father was defending the us capital in the district of columbia .
isnt that so well , dan . tell me the story of how you lost your leg .
did they shoot it off cut it off did the indians do it .
i saw something over there in the grass .
there aint nothing .
what if they caught up with the coach already what if they already know its crawley inside .
have you ever been to san francisco .
if its all right by you , mr . wade , i rather we not talk .
so youve never been in san francisco .
i know a girl there . shes the daughter of a sea captain .
she had the most beautiful green eyes .
the greenest eyes i ever saw .
like yours .
when i stared deep into them theyd just change color in front of me .
all the colors of the sea .
what did you say your name was again .
alice .
for gods sake , hes killed more men than the drought .
he is not what i expected .
he is dangerous dangerous is what he is , alice .
i dont want you or the boys talking to him .
you can change your mind , dan none will think less of you .
none can think less of me .
6 months from now , everything is going to be great .
cows are going to be fat .
we might even see the steam from the train coming over the ridge .
we will be allright , but we wont make it through the next 6 days , if i dont do this .
sorry , dan . mcelroy says 5 minutes .
do you think its too much for me .
hes a killer , daniel .
yet somehow i have the decency to bring him to justice .
what are you thinking .
i am not out there alone have a little faith in me .
ben wade has a gang and theyre out there tonight , somewhere .
if i dont go , we have to pack up and leave and god knows where w/o a prayer to .
now , i am tired , alice im tired of watching my boys go hungry .
im tired of the way they look at me im tired of the way that you dont .
ive been standing on one leg for 3 damned years , waiting for god to do me a favor .
and he aint listening .
mr . evans .
no , no , no . this is my horse now .
come over here .
dont give me any trouble , mark yes , sir .
boy .
i want to come with you well , you cant .
i can help .
youre 14 years old .
i can ride faster and you shoot better than any one of them .
the pinkerton is hurt , potter is no good , that railroad man is dead weight , and that other bastard .
i dont have time to argue i need you here .
thats that thats that .
so , boys , where are we headed .
it aint none of your business where we are headed , wade . youre a prisoner . you dont speak , you dont piss . you dont god damn breathe unless we say so .
do you understand that .
were taking you to contention putting you on the 3:10 to yuma , day after tomorrow .
you shouldnt have told him , now .
relax , friend . now if we get separated ill know where to meet up .
id like tol thank you for your hospitality , madame i hope i can send your husband back allright .
what did ben wade mean about sending pa back all right is he saying he was going to kill him .
ben wade dont have to lift a finger , his gang will do it for him .
your father can take care of himself .
so , were you conscripted into lincolns army , mr . evans or did you volunteered .
neither .
maybe both .
what does that means .
it means i was a volunteer for the massachusetts state guard then in 62 the federal government was running low on men so they called in the state militias .
to protect washinton . and thats when you got hurt .
what are you doing out here , dan youve got a family to protect .
you are not a law man , you dont work for the railroad like mr . shinny shoes over there .
not a pinkerton .
maybe i dont like the idea of men like you running loose .
its mans nature to take what he wants , dan .
its how we are born .
well , i make an honest living .
it might be honest , but i dont think its much of a living .
you must be hurting bad for money to take this job .
go to sleep .
i imagine debt puts a lot of pressure on a marriage .
are you married what would you know about marriage .
we cant all be cutthroats and thieves .
well , i know that if i was lucky enough to have a wife like alice , id treat her a whole lot better than you do , dan .
id feed her better , id buy her pretty dresses . i wouldnt make her work so hard .
yeah , id bet alice was a real pretty girl before she married you .
dont talk about my wife . you shut up about her . you say one more word and i cut your tongue .
id like the sight of it if you did .
its my watch , now .
i suppose its too much to ask for a little quiet .
the way i figured it: id be asleep in my own bed right now if it werent for you .
so if ive got to be up , you damn well be up with me too , .
son of a bitch .
enough .
enough thats enough , mcelroy .
we have to bury him .
if you take the time to dig one grave you might as well dig one for yourself .
lets go . mount up .
dont worry there , boss were going to get you out of there in a second .
wait wait .
no , no . dont do this .
dont do this . dont do this .
where is he .
open the door . open the door let me out of here , god damn it .
where did they take him .
i dont know .
mr . , youd better tell me where they took him .
or you will burn .
contention allright .
theyre going to contention .
theyre going to put him on the 3:10 to yuma prison . tomorrow .
let me go out of here .
contention is 80 miles back to the other way .
theyve just about killed our horses .
so , well buy new ones .
charlie , its his own fault he got caught he made a mistake .
you think you can do a better job leading this group .
maybe .
youve forgotten what he done for us .
were going to contention .
cant say i didnt warn you .
theres a shortcut we can take .
a shortcut .
through the pass .
it takes you right through contention .
why didnt you say something before .
its apache country .
i thought that the government gave them land . these are the ones who refused to go .
i wouldnt take that path you want us to take the long way .
thats right and let your boys catch us .
mr . butterfield , the apache who lived in that path are the ones that stayed to fight .
they enjoy killing .
you aint going to make it .
well take our chances .
something on your mind , dan .
why did you kill tucker .
why not me or butterfield .
hell , tucker took my horse .
did you liked him , dan no .
he told me he burned down your barn .
he was an asshole .
but wishing him dead and killing him are two different things .
your conscience is sensitive , dan .
i dont think its my favorite part of you .
, mr . wade . if you want to talk to somebody , talk to me .
i dont like talking to you , byron .
not when i have the gun .
no , that aint it . i just dont find you that interesting .
laugh it up , doc . till he guts you like a fish .
byron is like a song with one note .
did you ever read another book in your life , byron . besides the bible .
no need .
byron acts pius . a few years ago when he was under contract with central , .
ive seen him and a bunch of brother pinks .
mow down 32 apache women and children .
renegades . gunning down railroad men and their families .
picking them off the road , one by one . scalped .
there was youngnes running around . crying and screaming no more than 3 years old .
and his boys shot them all and pushed them into a ditch .
some of them were still crying .
i guess byron figured that jesus wouldnt mind .
apparently jesus dont like the apache .
keep on talking .
all the way to yuma . right up on them steps to the rope . straight to hell .
yeah , the day i die , byron .
im getting sprung from hell .
i might feel the same , if id come from the seed of a drunk grave digger and the rancid womb of a whore .
drop it , dan evans . drop it .
toss it to the ground , doc .
mr . butterfield .
i believe , dan , youre carrying a pistol as well . id appreciate it if you take it out and drop it on the ground . thank you .
now , ive always liked you , byron , .
, but you never knew when to shut up .
even bad men love their mommas .
now i think its time for everybody to go home .
dont you move , mr . wade .
let go of that shotgun .
william , what the hell are you doing here .
i dont think that youre going to shoot a man in the back of the head , boy .
dan , tell your boy its over .
you think you can keep you gun on him , william .
im doing a damn sight better than you did .
you ever been to dodge city .
stop talking to him .
the way youre shuffling those cards , i took you for a pro .
i practice a lot .
i can tell .
you ever been to dodge .
yes , indeed .
meanest , most beautiful , dirty city there ever was .
saloons just overflowing with cattle drivers and road agents , prospectors , gunslingers , gamblers and women .
women will do things to you youll never forget .
theyll give you disease youll never forget .
money in your pocket in dodge city you can have everything a man ever wished for .
everything a man comes to need .
i got i was a boy not much bigger than you .
now , how many men have you killed since then , wade .
how many families have you destroyed .
quite a few .
is it true that you dynamited a wagon full of prospectors in the western territories last spring .
no , thats a lie .
it was a train full .
i gotta take a piss .
you know , i thought he was going to shoot me back in the ravine .
i really thought he was going to do it .
there was a wildness in his eyes . he reminds me .
hes going to be nothing like you , wade .
a mans got to have a head start on the path of decency .
yeah , thats why i dont mess around with doing anything good , dan .
dou do one good deed for somebody .
i imagine its habit forming .
something decent . see that grateful look in their eyes .
i imagine it makes feel like christ hisself .
ive had enough of this , wade . come on . lets go .
its three of them yours .
if they were mine , youd be dead .
give me that gun , wade .
i told you not to come this way .
it was mcelroys decision .
i told you thered be trouble .
give me the keys to the handcuffs .
easy . easy now .
hes gone .
he took the horses with him . i found this in the grass .
thats the quickest way out of the pass hell be looking for help , to get his cuffs off .
we are going after him .
there aint no reward for getting him halfway to that train , is there .
ive got to be honest with you , i like some of their food .
as for wanting $40 a month now , i can .
hello , love .
god damned coolies . theyll work just fine with my left boot up their ass .
well , if i could teach a monkey to lay track , .
well . what we need here are some negros brought here , mister boles .
show these chinamen what real work is .
holly christ .
who is that .
thats him .
help me with the handcuffs .
break the chain . use the hammer . break the chain .
i have 5 guns on you out here , ben wade .
just come on out .
the horses .
what the hell is going on here .
mr . butterfield , all finished in bigsby .
mr . boles .
youd better hurry . were making the last blasts through the mountains this week .
thats my prisoner .
were taking him to contention , putting him on the prison train to yuma .
what prisoner .
come now , mr . boles . thats ben wade you have there .
ben wade gunned down my kid brother , .
in front of me , 6 years ago in abeline .
your brother was a lying card shark .
that is , if he is the asshole i remember . he could of course be some other asshole ive killed that ive forgot about .
you cant do that . thats immoral .
immoral aint got a damned thing to do with it .
i was expecting to collect a $200 reward for that man .
im delivering him to contention , i need that money .
need it bad enough to die .
at least let us take our horses .
ive got no problem with that .
as long as you ride away , mr .
nice knowing you , dan .
did we make it did we get away .
yeah , doc . we did .
thanks to you .
we need a place to lay low . keep him out of sight till the train comes .
there is a hotel up here , ill check to see , and you ride around back .
hey , will . you keep a watch on the rail head you see them coming .
ill let you know .
its the bridal suite , i hope you dont mind , its all they had .
well , well . that looks like rain clouds over bigsby .
you still need that $200 , dan .
shut up .
mr . evans , you continue to give me great confidence .
im going to see about the marshal .
were looking for a group escorting and outlaw by the name of ben wade .
yeah , weve been chasing them through these tunnels .
who you are .
whats it to you .
ben wade killed my brother .
then your brother must be famous .
are you , boys , some kind of posse .
i hate posses .
so this is the bridal suite .
now , i wonder how many brides have taken in this view .
what are you going to do with your $200 now , dan .
now that the rains are coming .
i owe people money , wade . that drought left me in the hole .
what do you think about double that amount .
you can pay your debts , buy a hundred more cows .
build a new barn .
how do you reckon im going to do that .
just lay down your gun and let me walk out the door . its worth $400 .
is that what you reckon my price is .
no , i reckon its a thousand one thousand dollars .
there was ten times that amount in butterfields coach .
do you want my cut , dan its all yours .
isnt that kind of reckless of you wade .
seeing that hmmm . youre so sure that your crew is coming to get you .
oh , theyre coming , dan .
sure as gods vengeance , theyre coming .
but i just like to do things easy .
imagine what you can do with $1000 , dan .
you can hire a couple of ranch hands . your boys could go to school , grow up smart .
what about alice .
she wouuld be the proud wife of a bonafide arizona rancher .
all youve got to do is say yes .
will you give me a bank note , wade or will you be kind enough to make a deposit for me .
cash .
you tell me , wade . how will i account for that amount of money .
what will i tell people when i spend it .
that you got the jump on me , you escaped , and somehow i got a fortune .
no . how dumb do you think people are .
nobody needs to know .
do you know what .
would you do me a favor .
dont talk to me for a while .
you mean were still not friends .
no . no , were not .
come 5 minutes to 3 , were going to be a hell of a lot closer than you think .
who is it .
its me , dan .
i brought help .
youve been gone for a long time , mr . butterfield .
how do i know someone aint got a gun on you out there .
dan , this is marshal will doane .
marshal mr . evans .
two of my finest men .
im sorry about all that , marshal , i am grateful for the help .
dont mention it .
so , you fellows are really going to help to put me on this train .
it might not seem like it , mr . wade , .
but we got law and order in this town , just like in any other .
well , thats very reassuring , marshal .
how much money is butterfield paying you .
thats not of your business .
youre coming with us .
every step of the way .
you have my word on that , dan .
that makes five of us . five is good .
it aint enough .
it aint nearly enough .
thats my boy .
theyre coming .
they are coming this way ive seen them where .
about a mile out , same way we come .
how many are they seven , eight .
which is it 7 or 8 .
seven .
folks , sorry to bother you , but im going to need you to move outside as quickly as possible .
thats it , folks . move along .
right there .
sure therere a lot of them youd figure , with it being the whole gang .
boss boss .
boss , are you are in there .
what do you want me to tell them .
you tell them youll write them a letter every day from yuma .
be careful , wade .
charlie , boys .
charlie , why dont you take the boys down to the saloon and boy them a drink .
are you ok .
i am fine . just sitting up here with my 4 new friends .
thats enough .
thank you , charlie .
listen up .
listen up .
thats ben wade they have up there .
now , the railroad intends .
to put him on the 3:10 to yuma and hang him .
whats he doing .
we will give you $300 cash .
to any man who shoots anyone of his captors .
$200 cash guaranteed .
$200 guaranteed .
ill take $200 give me the money .
youve got to shoot them first .
its gotta be 30 or 40 with guns out there now .
the hell with this .
now , just a minute , marshal .
now , look . if its a fair fight , sure . id stay for that . a fair fight .
thats a mans duty , but .
theres only 5 of us .
im sorry , mr , but im not going to die here today .
and neither are my men .
marshal , .
you forgot this .
now , you see , dan . generally , .
pretty much everyone .
. wants to live .
ill double your money .
lets go , boys .
please , do you want to see us shot down in the street .
this thing happened in bigsby .
that means butterfield too .
why bring your troubles to contention .
weve got families everyone of us is a family man .
im a family man too .
hes gona walk out on you .
then youd best get out like the rest of us .
hes not gonna come back up here hes gonna walk out on you .
now , what youve got to figure is why you and your boy are gonna die .
because of butterfields railroad loss of money .
theyre all of them .
almost .
your move , general .
what do you expect him to say .
i expect him to say something that makes sense .
something that might save the two of you .
take a look , dan whats the matter you dont want to see .
ill see them soon enough .
what about you , kid you wanna look .
stay away from the window , william .
go on take a look .
theyre animals all of them .
theyre gonna kill you and your father , william .
and ill laugh while they do it .
i think you know that .
call them them off .
why should i .
because youre not all bad .
yes , i am .
your saved us from those indians . i saved myself .
you got us through the tunnels you helped us get away .
if i had a gun in them tunnels , i wouldve used it on you .
i dont believe you .
kid , i wouldnt last 5 minutes leading an outfit like that if i wasnt as rotten as hell .
dan , .
i cant do it , .
dan , and if i cant do it , you shouldnt do it either .
they say discretion is the better part of valor .
if you think that you have an olbigation to me or to the railroad .
i assure you you do not , im releasing you .
its just you left , dan . just you and your boy .
maybe he is right , pa , maybe we should go home .
what did doc potter gave his life for , william .
and mcelroy .
little red ants on a hill .
ill pay you the $200 , dan . right now . and you can walk away .
you know , this whole ride , its been nagging on me .
thats what the government gave me for my leg .
$198.36 and the funny thing is that .
when you think about it .
which i have been lately is that they werent paying me to walk away . they were paying me so they could walk away .
dont muddy the past on the present , dan .
no , no , no , wade . im seeing the world the way it is .
if you take him to the train , pa , im going with you .
no , mr . butterfields gonna take you home .
no , im not going any yes , you are .
im staying here with you .
youre going to hold up in the room across the hall . youre going to wait until we leave .
ill get him to bigsby . youve got my promise .
youre going to promise a lot more than that , butterfield .
i want guarantees that hollander and his boys will never set foot on my land again .
and that my water is going to flow . and i expect you to hand my wife $1000 cash when you see her . youve got money to spare .
i can deliver that , just get him on the train .
you heard him i heard him .
i want you to give this back to your mother .
i want you to tell her it helped me find what is right .
pa , i cant just leave you .
im going to be a day behind you , william unless something happens . and if it does , i need a man at the ranch .
to run things; to protect our family . and i know that you can do that because youve become a fine man , william .
youve become a fine man youve got all the best parts of me .
what few there are .
and you just remember that your old man hauled ben wade to that station when nobody else would .
you know , squeezing that watch wont stop time .
dont get so scared .
you might pack a bad mood .
ever read the bible , dan .
i read it one time . i was 8 years old . my daddy had just got himself killed over a shot of whiskey and my mom said we were going back east to start over .
so she gave me a bible , sat me down at the train station . told me to read it .
she was going to get our tickets .
well , i did what she said i read that bible cover to cover .
it took me 3 days .
she never came back .
its time .
its a half mile to the station from here , dan .
i guess were walking .
lucky .
youre not gonna get a chance to use those scofields , charlie .
perhaps you can explain to me the next portion of your plan , dan .
hey hey .
not the black hat .
you dumb shits .
charlie .
get back get back .
lets go white door move it .
i cant do this no more , dan .

charlie prince .
yeah , boss hold your fire .

its my son , mark .
the young one .
he got tuberculosis when he was 2 .

ayear younger than i was for my first .
when can i have a stag a stag .
come on tell me again what you said last week .
let that be a reminder to you .
i got it . i got it .
why would they join against the irish .
because someone has to stand up to them . you .
me , marke , all the tribes . we cant resist alone .
i could . my little warrior .
we have to be careful .
come home without something for your lady , youll have hell to pay .
can i of course you can , boy .
the angles have arrived , my lord .
as well as the celts , my fellow jutes and the saxons .
good . with marke .
well all be here . yeah . its a great day .
let us hope so . yeah .
thanks .
we heard the news . pray for a son .
mother . welcome to tantallon .
i made this for you .
friends .
look at us , the tribes of britain .
divided .
weak . just as the irish like us .
but if we were one land united .
we would outnumber them 2to1 .
we could defeat them once and for all . thats why were here today .
to sign this treaty of unification . who would be king .
the strongest among us .
lord marke .
look , if youre happy sending all your gold to ireland .
living as slaves , by all means , do nothing .
if we were happy doing that , we would never have risked coming here .
friends , my wife is with child . my heart tells me its a boy .
i want him to grow old in a land where all of us .
all the tribes pict .
celt , angle , jute , saxon are at peace .
this island has not known unity since the romans left .
that is why i sign this treaty .
and why should we follow you perhaps , wictred .
because your last attempt to form an alliance .
without the knowledge of half the barons in this room has failed .
alarm .
what for the irish are here .
take all your men , guard the women . but you wont have enough .
go .
quickly tristan back this way . hurry .
move down the ranks .
how did they know .
tristan no .
let me fight .
please , dont hurt him .
shes with the gods now , isolde . youll see her again someday .
will i .
morholt returns .
what news of the treaty .
good , morholt .
good .
your mother loved you so much , isolde .
why did she die , bragnae why .
it was an ill vapor that took her .
a fever .
no . it was her heart .
the irish have been here .
your husband .
oh . oh , sister , im so sorry .
the executions lasted a day .
they made sport of us .
a whole generation of men .
whos this .
tristan , son of aragon .
were his family now .
i have a son about your age .
melot . melot .
melot , this is tristan .
what shall we do , my lord .
rebuild .
three , four .
one , two dont hold back .
come on .
three , four .
tristan wont fight me . look , hes scared .
one , two , three .
still wont fight hes got the heart of a lion .
just needs some time .
whyd you take off your helmet you going to cry .
my father died too , but you dont see me crying .
melot . thats right , run .
find another trapdoor to hide under , coward .
tristan .
tristan tristan . we found something .
come on , this way . quick , come on .
you are gonna love it . youll love it .
yeah , i i found this trapdoor .
who found a trapdoor .
all right , simon . well , you tell us how you found it .
look at that .
where does this lead .
youll see .
well , i like that vase .
think ill have that .
we always knew the castle was built on roman foundations .
but we didnt think anything was left .
must be a burial crypt or something .
here we are . bottom of the keep .
who else knows about this .
nobody . good .
these savages have rebuilt the castle in cornwall .
only now its made of stone .
for cornwalls next tribute , i want slaves young ones .
their future .
if marke resists , have morholt crush him .
my king . morholt .
i have led your armies to victories far and near .
ive made you rich and powerful .
yes , you have . you have been most loyal .
when i return from cornwall , i was hoping .
what would please you .
a wife .
its dark in an hour .
what do you think is really out there .
britannia .
the old roman lands .
a world full of evil and grief .
i want to see it .
do you know what the future looks like , bragnae .
i see the life you were meant for .
your father will speak with you .
am i just a chattel to be traded at your pleasure .
do i have no say in my own life .
you have a duty to your king .
you are my father .
then obey me , daughter .
your father has given you the news .
and do you welcome it i accept it .
you know , were more alike than you might guess .
how so .
i , too , dabble in elixirs .
poison . its from the livers of puffer fish .
just a taste paralyzes all the senses .
so if the blade doesnt kill .
rendered safe by thistle and bark .
and do you know the antidote for this .
yohimbine .
makes a hard man even harder .
the only cure: wild abandon .
till our wedding day .
release them .
hey . around . around .
off me .
go find tristan . leave her .
take him there . get a rope .
anyone foolish enough to interfere in any way .
shall suffer the same fate . no .
please dont . dont . take me . no no .
widseth .
if there are any more attacks , we shall put our guests .
to death and raze this entire land .
take the horses .
when would you strike at once .
throw everything we have at them . theyre hoping youll do that .
on horse they outnumber us 2to1 . youll lead the men straight to their deaths .
so we do nothing donnchadh would like that even more .
me to lose face in front of the other tribes .
no . we must act .
it must be decisive .
but we cannot act alone .
so have the good men of york come to fight with us .
hmm or the saxons of wessex .
my men dont want to follow a pict into battle .
let alone one leading a pack of angles and celts .
then why are you here .
i thought tristan should let me command his men .
i make it my habit to follow no one . except marke .
marke delivered me from that palace when i was a boy . you ran .
so you can understand when i think ofkings , i think ofhim .
and when i think of cowards theyre one day from their boats on the roman road .
now , who will ride out with tristan to fight them .
what is your plan , tristan .
i need our two fastest runners .
there they go after them .
hold off .
halt .
go around .
morholt theyre back .
theyve got a head .
its a trap .
kill the slaves .
simon .
were gonna get you home .
i dont want to die .
i cant feel my legs or my hands .
poison .
a second boat .
he shall have a kings service .
farewell , tristan of aragon .
death to the irish .
when the irish came to cornwall .
and my father surrendered .
you spared a dozen out of a hundred .
i am even less kind .
the leader and three will take this message home .
as for the rest .
victory .
and tristan .
simon too .
did i love him like a son .
or did i misuse him for my own purposes he knew .
he knew .
where are we going away .
are you afflicted , child speak to me .
your father will find us and have my head .
you are my charge . please .
i am no ones charge .
you are .
and you will be morholts lady .
and live a loveless life like my mom .
whats that .
where .
isolde , wait . dont .
isolde , dont .
isolde its a man .
dead .
alive bragnae , help me .
help me .
isolde . quickly .
start a fire .
oh . quickly .
his heart falters .
what are you doing he needs heat . now .
get your clothes off , quickly .
hurry .
quickly smell that smell the poison .
when he warms , well need thistle and bark .
ive not been naked with a man for 15 years .
hello .
youve been sleeping a long time .
youre in ireland . did you know that .
shh .
its all right .
youre safe here . no one knows .
dont be scared . just sleep .
sleep .
oh .
no its all right . you dont need that .
i forgot to tell him about you .
ill wait outside with the other beasts .
you said no one else knew . sorry .
shes my maid , sworn to silence .
um , lie down , please .
please .
its good youre remembering things . this might sting .
do you remember anything else .
the boat i found you in .
how you got this .
too many questions . there . keep that dry .
here are clothes , bread .
you have water and fire .
the oceans outside if you wish a bath .
you wont know where youre going , so please dont try to leave .
just trust me .
why are you doing this .
ill be back .
this is a dangerous game youre playing .
hes english , isolde . and weve got him prisoner .
under no circumstances tell him your name , you hear me .
i thought you wished to escape this place .
did you hear me .
youll do no such thing . hell need more food tomorrow .
hes not of your concern .
youve been away . oh , you noticed .
yes , i have a bit . where .
bragnae and i were spying the convent at brittas .
seeking sanctuary some women need it .
youll find no refuge in the new religion .
your place is here , with morholt .
any word of my betrothed .
overdue .
but comforted , no doubt , that you yearn for him .
whats your name .
oh , i think its better we dont bother with names .
how can i thank you if i dont have your name .
you just did .
if you insist , my name is bragnae .
im a ladyinwaiting at the court . my parents are dead .
my mother , shes the source of the kindness you find so puzzling .
my father would have left you where you fell .
im tristan of aragon .
well , tristan of aragon .
id guess about you too , but i think ive already seen everything .
sir , i hope you appreciate the risks .
we are taking and will honor us by leaving as soon as you are able .
she likes me .
shes right though . you do risk .
here . and what of your parents .
they also died when i was a child .
of what .
a different type of irish kindness .
im sorry .
tomorrow then .
tomorrow .
there she who bore you brought you forth .
set me as a seal upon your heart .
as a seal upon your arm .
for love is as strong as death . .
ridiculous .
i happen to believe what that says .
dont you think theres more to life .
than what something more than duty and death .
why be capable of feelings if were not to have them .
why long for things if theyre not meant to be ours .
oh , dont listen to me .
youre so sure of things .
your certainty , itsits like armor . i wish i had that .
why would you need it the joy of being a lady .
wanting something i cant have .
a life of my own .
time you must leave now .
ill follow you later .
you need a rest .
in case your betrothed would want to see you .
youre promised .
yes .
whats he like .
dark , tall , nearly twice your size .
an absolute gentleman .
i thought .
earlier when you spoke of wanting something you cant have .
i didnt know what i was talking about .
outside , just past that bluff , there is a boat .
thats how you should go when you leave .
you should go soon .
how do you feel .
its lord bodkin .
tristan they found your boat .
at this very moment , the king himself is scouring the coasts .
hell find you . he finds everyone . the tide is coming . you must go .
come with me .
come with me . i cant .
why not please .
tristan , we both know this cant be . weve known it from the start .
that doesnt mean it isnt true . it is .
it just cannot be .
i want to know that youre alive somewhere and thinking of me from time to time .
i want to know that theres more to this life , and i cant know that if they kill you .
a cornish warrior may be ashore .
beware . we seek him as i speak .
hopefully , its just his rotted corpse well find .
for he has slain your betrothed .
morholt is dead , fallen in battle .
isolde .
bragnae , catch and comfort her .
we should , uh we should assault the british straightaway .
crush them with maximum force .
maximum force .
the one butchered by markes tribes would that be the force you speak of .
well not confront them again until our numbers are refreshed .
and until then .
well have cunning divide them .
of what nature .
a prize , perhaps .
whats this about a tournament .
donnchadh .
hes offered his daughter and the lands of lionath .
as dowry to whichever english tribe wins .
its a clever way of setting us against each other .
well , the other barons will see through that .
as baron of wessex .
its my duty to fight in this tournament for my people .
for yourself , you mean . and what of the support you promised tristan .
tristans dead .
my people have suffered enough .
they see the wealth of lionath on offer . that seems more real than any alliance .
my mind is set . and ours as well .
so be it .
youre weary . let me rally our friends . ill lead them against donn .
melot , melot , melot , melot , melot .
youre my blood .
and youre a noble presence , but .
hes back hes alive .
tristan we thought you werent alive .
hes back lord marke , its tristan .
it cant be .
i saw you dead .
i am delivered .
please , tristan , tell us more .
tristan , there must be a story .
a toast to tristan .
back from the dead . yeah , back from the dead .
tristan , the irish king offers his daughter in tournament and divides all our tribes .
whether for the power or the wealth , half the barons .
are sending champions to fight at dunluce . tristan .
god knows what happened to him .
my face in thine eyes .
thine in mine appears .
and true plain hearts do in the faces rest .
whatever dies was not mixed equally .
if our two loves be one .
or thou and i love so alike .
that none can slacken , none can die . .
what its the only way to keep the alliance alive .
i fail to see how fighting with our partners keeps us allies .
well , theyre all going to the tournament anyway .
by announcing youll share the dowry with every baron who remains loyal .
while in turn offering support to whomever prevails .
the others will be compelled to follow you when you win it . if we win .
if we lose , we could end up following wictred .
id need an infallible champion .
me .
youre not yet healed .
well , this trip will be my tonic . ill be ready .
you know i will .
whats the source of this fervor .
let me go and win you a wife .
she can make peace without spilling one drop of blood .
and maybe heal the wound from which you still ache .
truce .
you have safe passage .
youll all go over there .
how do i look how do you look .
wheres this princess whats her name , isolde .
i want to see what she looks like .
there . almost done .
no , not quite .
if im a present , i should be fully wrapped .
name lebourne of bracht .
i dont believe you .
name .
name .
ah , see how the bees come to the honey .
name tristan of aragon .
so he lives . for the moment .
wictred of glastonbury .
i fight with no champion in my stead .
note that .
why wictred .
because the barons will never unite behind him .
you think shes got the pox .
since the dawn of time .
the knight has gathered at tournaments .
for only a true heart can prevail in battle .
warriors , begin .
hes got him now .
make it look real . what .
i yield .
real enough , i hope .
water you did great .
yeah look .
no hey you cant do that .
allow it .
hunwalt yields to tristan of aragon .
antwon of wessex will fight kingsid .
hey its too easy for you , eh .
good , tristan good so much for a fair draw .
lord wictred of glastonbury be sure . choose the right time .
wear him down first , huh tristan of aragon will fight singbard .
hallach yields to the lord wictred .
yeah .
singbard yields to tristan of aragon .
kingsid yields to antwon of wessex .
lord wictred of glastonbury will fight fohall .
fohall yields .
to lord wictred .
anwalt yields to tristan of aragon .
lord wictred of glastonbury will fight morlock .
mace . tristan of aragon .
from the house of cornwall , will fight hunwalt .
morlock yields to lord wictred .
well done , tristan . you have this . this is yours .
you have one more fight . take deep breaths .
one more and youre done . come on .
wictred , lord of glastonbury .
tristan , champion of marke of cornwall .
tristan tristan .
go on .
go , tristan .
yield .
yeah .
you did it .
an impressive victory .
of course , the man who defeats morholt might be expected to triumph here .
on behalf of cornwall .
i offer your daughter a place on our throne .
the throne of england , united behind one leader .
perhaps it is just that he who took a husband provides one .
im yours .
tristan of aragon .
has won you on behalf of lord marke of cornwall .
come on . lets go .
come , isolde . come .
weve done it , huh .
let them take her across the sea .
after the wedding , ill disavow isolde .
this alliance will crumble .
the princess wants to speak to you .
you risked your life to give me to another man .
you said your name was bragnae .
why did you do that .
god , what have i done .
youll stop this then . say something .
i cant . i won you in my kings name .
but im yours . you touched me , and i you . it doesnt matter .
its the only thing that matters , tristan . leave with me . ill go anywhere .
your marriage will end a hundred years of bloodshed . my marriage to another man .
isolde . we will live with this .
we must .
dont do this to me .
tristan , weve made shore .
what if shes a hag or she simply wont have me .
she will , brother . youre the prize .
a rose look at her .
my lord .
isolde . welcome .
i couldnt be happier .
if things were different .
if we lived in a place without duty , would you be with me .
that place does not exist .
ill pretend its you .
youre trembling .
youre far from home . im a stranger still . that i understand .
but you mustnt fear me . hmm .
my only wish is to make you happy .
as a wife . as a woman .
and hopefully , one day .
the fact that im not whole .
will not offend you .
thats pretty . did you make it .
it was a present .
tristan . might i stay here a while .
of course .
a little bit sour , but taste it .
ive never seen him like this before .
perhaps someone his own age should speak with him .
perhaps .
marke and edyth say youre distant .
theyre worried about you . so am i . i can tell .
laughing at the market , holding hands .
a caress on the neck when he pours your wine .
hes my husband . i remember whose kingdom im in and why . yes , well . i must confess .
i thought you might have the tiniest of difficulties performing your duties .
am i not permitted a single moment without mourning .
im living with this , tristan , as you said we must .
i live in torture , thinking of these moments .
every look he gives you , i get sicker and sicker .
theres a burning in me . i feel on fire , and theres guilt , and i cant get rid of either .
does it make you happy to know that .
the roman bridge .
i can get to it without being seen .
and i would go there any time to be with you .
welcome , barons of anglia , rothgar and orick .
wessex , kaye and wictred .
as you will be king and his daughter queen .
does that mean donnchadh will be coming to the coronation .
it does , on the next full moon . all will attend .
a lot can happen in a month .
and given the instabilities of our new land .
i shall be naming a second .
my sister has raised one capable of guiding you , should the need arise .
hes a man of passion , fierce in battle .
who has learned to tame his heart with his head .
i give you tristan of aragon .
for the first time since the romans .
this country stands united .
i cant be your second . melot must be . hes blood .
besides , i wish tojourney north .
you no longer sleep at dor , and now you dont want to be my second .
and you find no comfort in your home , these stone walls that you helped build .
i find these walls a prison . why .
everything i wanted seems meaningless .
ever since you were a boy .
youve sacrificed everything for me , all for one dream .
now youve reached that dream .
its natural that youll feel some loss .
it doesnt matter if you want to be second . you are .
i will only be king if you are my second .
id put it more gently if i could . then i am your second .
perhaps its time you took a wife . no .
you cant live alone forever . i can .
i was trying to explain to tristan the importance oflove .
seems he might live without it . why .
there are other things to live for duty , honor .
they are not life , tristan . they are the shells of life .
and empty ones if in the end .
all they hold are days and days without love .
love is made by god .
ignore it and you suffer as you cannot imagine .
then i will no longer live without it .
good . very good .
come . well be late . late .
the warriors ride out on the full moon .
its an old ritual . i shall miss you tonight .
how many did you love before me .
none .
and after me .
lord marke are you all right .
nothing hurt but my pride .
tristan , i need to speak with you . yeah .
we havent even had a coronation yet , and marke and wictred are already at odds .
now , he breaks tradition and scares all the barons by naming you his second .
i tried to convince him youd be better .
yes , well , peace can be just as treacherous as war .
and i fear that marke doesnt re .
listen to me .
our attention must be on cornwall , now more than ever . melot .
im sorry he didnt choose you . i am .
can i speak to you .
uncle , you dont seem to understand what you have done here .
im sick of your moaning why cant .
what do you think became of them .
they were lives , just lived .
i find myself imagining things in this place .
i decorate it books , a harp there .
a child .
would it be his or mine .
id have no way to tell , would i .
hes a kind man , tristan . i cannot hate him .
yesterday at the market , i saw a couple holding hands .
and i realized well never do that .
never anything like it .
no picnics or unguarded smiles .
no rings .
just stolen moments that leave too quickly .
this ones pretty . they look the same to me .
i like this one . tristan , where have you been hiding .
now that youre here , are we going to be honored with your presence tonight .
whwhere is the .
about time .
wheres isolde i dont know for sure .
she was having a walk in the garden before and .
im afraid i grew tired , so i returned .
um , its my fault .
want to get caught , the both of you .
hes lookin for you right now .
not through the castle . hell see you .
i told you this was going to happen .
theres another door here , forgotten .
this comes up in the bottom chamber of the keep .
i hate this . hurry .
go on .
im tired of this . tired of lying for you .
sick of it . then dont .
there was a servants child . quite ill , but doing better now .
i didnt ask you where you were .
your hearts beating so fast .
is it .
is there anything i can do to make you happy .
i want to make you happy .
im fine .
shes in love with tristan . theyre intimates .
if i expose them , itll break markes heart and his hold on the other barons .
with markes champion in chains , ill take castle dor .
you can land your armies unopposed . therell be no one defending the inland waters .
and your price .
i want markes throne .
in a few years , when his reign falls apart .
well go over and pick up the pieces .
may i speak with you .
is it possible , do you think , a man blinded by love .
is it possible that man might not see treachery right in front of him .
i found this hidden among isoldes things .
do you think she has a lover .
has she said anything to you .
perhaps you could follow her . i , uh .
l i cant ask anyone else .
i know , i i know what you think . im acting like a child , but .
normally i can read faces .
with hers , i feel i i cant be objective .
shes so delicate . i just look at it and i .
you really love her .
oh , i do . terribly .
i didnt know how empty i was .
she sustains me . she thrills me .
and when i see this ring , its a ring of thorns .
the ring is nothing . shes loyal to you .
im sure of it .
if you say so .
i count nine .
if they move in , have your squires fly a black flag .
you bring an entourage .
i cant go sailing all alone in my position , lord marke .
dont worry . theyll stay offshore .
daughter , i have missed you .
my nephew , melot , governor of cornwall .
and tristan , slayer of my best general .
winner of isolde . defender of the alliance .
youre a fortunate man . indeed .
seems i worried for nothing .
may i dance with the queen .
or is tristan to have the next one no .
thats right . youve never danced with isolde before .
a new song for tristan .
slow .
why did you burn it .
you know .
meet me there now or ill die .
i could still tutor you a thing or two .
accuse him now . no , no , no , no .
well have more than accusations .
is something the matter im im just feeling a little weary , thats all .
might just go and have a lie down .
friends , friends , hear me .
weve forgotten the full moon . isnt it time to ride out .
no , no , no , no . this night calls for an exception .
oh , but the coronation should uphold tradition .
surely , do we neglect it already .
we honor it with half a night .
ride out .
wheres tristan .
i miss ireland .
isolde , this must end .
thats like asking me to stop breathing . it cannot be .
hey , hey , hey , hey . over here . through here .
please dont leave me .
isolde . tristan , what are you .
i see how it is in cornwall .
my money is good enough . my alliance is good enough .
but my daughter you pass among your lieutenants like a whore .
its not like i see no relation to me here .
there is no peace with this king .
i pledge no allegiance to shame . i wont fight for this .
seize them .
behold your hero , uncle .
ill have my own heroes now .
theyre ashore .
prove your worth .
if a man cant rule his woman .
how can he govern an entire kingdom he cant .
yeah . we should sue for peace .
its all been coming apart . you can feel it .
youre right . theres very little time .
fortunately , donnchadh has no quarrel with anyone here .
hes asked me to give you a message .
whats this .
its compensation for the men youll lose .
attacking castle dor with donnchadh tomorrow .
lets be honest . our people need a stronger chief .
who might that be , wictred melot .
for too long , the ablest among us has been denied his rightful place .
i pledge him my allegiance and offer my services as his second .
i like this plan .
i came to apologize . ive been selfish .
arrogantly thinking that perhaps id given enough .
over these past nine years to merit , if not your love , then at least your respect .
a home .
a kingdom , your very life .
why was it not enough .
tell me .
tell me .
you dont know what you have done .
everything is destroyed everything .
all because you did not have enough .
shes loyal to you . i am sure of it . .
you bloodsucker . what i could have been .
had i not stretched out this hand to save your wretched life .
how i curse that day . how i curse it .
well , insult me with your defense .
then i will contemplate your punishment .
donnchadh marches on us as we speak .
shes young , and they were wrong .
but king or no king , i will not let you harm her .
how long .
since you thought he was dead .
i found him , wounded , on a beach in ireland .
i hid him from my father .
and i told him my name was bragnae .
so when he came to the tournament at dunluce to win donnchadhs daughter .
he didnt realize it was me .
all this time , my heart has been his .
and im sorry .
he tried harder .
than you can possibly imagine , because he loves you .
i will coax them out and make sure donnchadh knows this .
of course . of course .
you know , as things move forward .
i must confess i suspected the both of them for some time .
tristan and isolde you know what i could never work out .
how it was conducted . how she got in and out of dor unseen .
the tunnel . what .
the roman tunnel .
show me .
what is this .
the will of the king .
farewell .
you two . run up . get up in the keep .
i told him about ireland .
hes given us our freedom .
why does loving you feel so wrong .
get in .
tristan , if we do this .
for all time , theyd say it was our love brought down a kingdom .
remember us .
tristan , no tristan stop stop .
tristan enough .

i dont know if life is greater than death .
but love was more than either .

without sharp north , without declining west .
whatever dies was not mixed equally .
and thou and i love so alike that none can slacken .

he was so scared and excited .
and very young .
and i loved him so fiercely .
then you said yes , right .
no . i wanted to say yes , but i said no .
i wasnt ready , .
neither was he .
so we took our time .
looked forward to it .
didnt want to run into something with nothing to count on but love .
a man has to be understanding .
and put his wife before himself .
can you do that , peter .
yeah . i think i can .
then you have my blessing .
i hope youve considered a proper proposal .
your uncle had it all planned .
he took me to the beach one sunday .
he was a knockout in his bathing suit .
and i , i didnt look too bad myself .
we were very good swimmers .
it was a beautiful day , .
and he said: lets swim to the island .
and at the island , .
we found a perfect spot by an old tree , .
and we lay down and looked up at the sky .
and then he said , close your eyes , may .
and i did . and then he said , open them .
and i did .
and he was holding this ring .
dazzling , in front of me .
i thought it was the sun .
wed be married 50 years .

pekar .
um , i have a request .
my girlfriend will be coming , .
and i have this ring .
ah . all� .
oh , so you want to pop the question tonight , hein .
yes , and i want to do something very special .
i love it .
romance .
i am french .
when i signal you , if youd bring some champagne with the ring .
inside bottom of her glass .
perfect . magnifique .
also i thought , at the same time .
could the musicians .
play this song .
their favorite .
and take good care of the ring .
they are an army unlike any other .
crusading across the stars toward a place called underverse .
their promised land . a constellation of dark new worlds .
necromongers theyre called .
and if they cannot convert you , they will kill you .
leading them , the lord marshal .
he alone has made a pilgrimage to the gates of the underverse .
and returned a different being .
stronger . stranger . half alive and half .
something else .
if we are to survive , a new balance must be found .
in normal times , evil would be fought by good .
but in times like these .
well , it should be fought by another kind of evil .
lining him up for you .
portside shot coming up .
steady . here we go .
take it take a shot .
shit .
toombs , were running out of rope shut up i got it again .
now .
toombs .
riddick .
i dont know , toombs . looks kind of tight .
not where im sitting . this is the biggest payday ever .
so throw on a fresh pair of panties . lets get this right .
three meters clearance portside . one and a half meters starboard .
we got a chokepoint coming up .
what the shit was that .
tags , you got eyes on riddick .
tags .
jesus .
he just ghosted two guys , and i never even saw him .
what do you think maybe we ought to just .
i think youre my new gunner . grab a gat .
stay on top of him this time .
you made three mistakes .
first , you took the job .
second , you came light .
a fourman crew for me fucking insulting .
but the worst mistake you made .
thats right . empty gun rack .
whats the bounty on my head 1 mil .
1.5 .
what slam pays 1.5 for a convict .
private party .
guy easy anonymous . thats what the sheet said .
what planet .
helion prime .
whoa . where you going last question .
and you better get this one right , merc .
whose ship is this .
mine wrong answer .
knew theyd come for me . took them five years , but i knew .
you dont expect these mercs to have any honour , any code .
but this new bounty from a holy man .
a guy whose neck i saved .
well , lesson learned . no such word as friend .
can only end bad when you let someone get too close .
bad for them .
so now its back to civilisation .
all the brightness , and everything i hate .
just wanted to be left alone .
helion prime is on alert condition four .
all unrecognised craft will be escorted to the ground .
for security inspections .
unrecognised craft , follow me .
to spaceport 6 for security inspections .
do you hear me follow me to spaceport 6 now .
follow this .
did you know all your doors were locked .
five years ago , i took two people off that planet .
a kid , jack , who everyone else thought was a boy .
and a holy man searching for new mecca .
i told one man where i might go .
i showed trust to one man .
did i make a mistake , lmam .
there is no simple answer .
whatever was said was meant to give us a chance .
a fighting chance .
were it not for the threat of invasion .
i never would have betrayed you . i give you my word , riddick .
riddick .
and a daughter .
no . whose name would be .
if you have issue with me , you let it be with me .
you need not know their names .
ziza . my name is ziza .
ziza .
cute kid .
did you really kill monsters .
the ones that were gonna hurt my father .
such are our bedtime stories .
go , ziza . go on .
it is said the comet always precedes them .
these worldenders .
the coalsack planets are gone . eight million settlers missing .
the entire aquilan system is gone , too .
my god , how do i save my family .
have you heard anything ive said .
you said its all circling the drain . the whole universe .
right thats right .
had to end sometime .
the one you want is now here .
and whose throat is this .
if you cut my throat .
ill not be able to rescind the offer that brought you here .
nor tell you why its so vital that you did come .
the blade comes off when the bounty comes off .
this is aereon . an envoy from the elemental race .
she means you no harm .
there are very few of us .
who have met a necromonger and lived to speak of it .
so when i choose to speak of it , you should choose to listen .
necromonger .
it is the name that will convert or kill .
every last human life .
unless furyan warriors are found .
maybe you should pretend like youre talking to .
someone educated in the penal system .
in fact , dont pretend .
there is a story , riddick , of young male furyans .
strangled at birth . strangled with their own cords .
when aereon told this story to the helion leaders .
i told her of you .
what do you know of your early years .
do you remember your homeworld where it was .
have you met any others others like yourself .
sister , they dont know what to do with just one of me .
spoken like a true furyan .
open up in there open up stand back .
they are searching houses .
they look for a man who came here today .
they think he might be a spy . a spy .
did someone see him come here today did they .
lajjun , stop .
i will send them away . but wait one minute , please .
will you wait one minute to save worlds .
not my fight .
so you will leave us to our fate .
just like you did her . break it down .
get in .
come , let us try to send them away .
just let me have her come on .
leave us alone .
there is no one here .
you dont understand . he can help us .
youre not afraid of the dark , are you .
the light hurts my eyes .
where is he he went to this side .
where is he .
in here .
you mentioned her .
she went looking for you .
people died . she went to prison . i am not sure where .
it was a world so hot , you couldnt set foot on the surface .
crematoria .
young jack . she thought of you as her older brother .
she worshipped you . you were supposed to watch her .
she never forgave you for leaving .
just when she needed you most . she needed to stay away from me .
you all do .
are you gonna stop the new monsters now .
furyans . defiant to the end .
no , no . we go to the shelter .
we take only ourselves .
turn back go to the other shelter .
they wont let us in get back .
stay close .
we must cross the river .
flight leaders , all squads off the ground now .
we have heavy inbound .
theyre coming back .
the next shelter . this way .
ill see if its safe .
stay back . come , ziza .
dont they have real guns .
take aim and fire .
now theyre going down .
lajjun and ziza .
when its over .
let me go . i must go to my family . when its over .
lets get your family .
in here .
get in .
imam . dont follow me .
there will be an afterlife for me .
will there be for you .
lets go replenish the ranks .
never fails to inspire , does it each time a dynasty falls .
remember your place , dame vaako .
my place is at your side , dear husband .
from here till underverse come .
in this verse , humans have been fractured .
divided by all their many races , creeds , and mistaken faiths .
our purpose is to correct that mistake .
because there is another verse .
another universe that he has found .
where anyone can begin anew .
where you can live free of pain .
a perfect new place called underverse .
look around you . every necromonger in this hall .
every one of the legion vast .
that just swept aside your defences in one night .
was once like you .
fought as feebly as you .
because every necromonger that lives today is a convert .
therell be no conversions .
we all began as something else .
it was hard for me to accept , too , when i first heard these words .
but i changed .
i let them take away my pain .
you betrayed your faith . and i changed .
just as you will change .
when you realise that the underverse will be reached .
only by those who have embraced the necromonger faith .
for those of you who will right now .
drop to your knees and ask to be purified .
we will not renounce our faith no one here will do what you ask .
it is unthinkable .
this is a world of many peoples , many religions .
and we simply cannot and will not be converted .
then ill take your soul .
join him .
or join me .
this is your one chance .
take the lord marshals offer and bow .
i bow to no man .
hes not a man .
hes the holy halfdead who has seen the underverse .
and returned with powers you cant imagine .
look , im not with everyone here .
but i will take a piece of him .
a piece you will have .
stop him .
irgun . one of my best .
if you say so .
what do you think of this blade .
i think its a halfgram heavy on the back end .
in our faith , you keep what you kill .
take him back to my ship for mind regression .
perhaps the breeder would do it .
if somebody just asked him .
it is a rare offer .
a visit inside necropolis .
its been a long time since i smelled beautiful .
let me show you the way .
beautiful eyes . come .
the last six lord marshals have called this home .
magnificent , isnt it .
i might have gone a different way . true of us all .
converts receiving the mark of the necromonger .
they learn how one pain can lessen another .
there now .
that is just perfect .
the more you resist them .
the greater the damage will be .
a new one .
youve brought us a new one .
interesting breeder .
making entry .
this wont take long .
weve entered his neocortex .
the riddick regress .
scanning fresh memories .
thoughts of someone called jack .
jack .
she went to prison .
now we find thoughts of an elemental .
the one race that would slow the spread of necromongers .
furyans .
where does he come from .
who are his people these are the things i need to know .
we find energy .
we find furyan energy .
hes furyan .
a furyan survivor kill the furyan .
kill the riddick .
kill riddick .
find him . whatever it takes . find him .
let me guess . a fiveman crew this time .
couple of things you could have done better .
first , trash the locater beacon inside my ship , the one you jacked .
and second , and this is really the more important part .
you should have wasted me when you had the chance .
any questions yeah .
what took you so long .
decoy launched .
in and out . unsuspected and undetected .
damn , i love a good smashandgrab .
bountys as good as ours . preparing to engage ion drive .
so where do we drop your merckilling ass .
whos gonna pay the most for you now butcher bay .
butcher bay .
ten minutes every other day on the dogrun .
protein waffles arent bad .
how about ursa luna nice little doublemax prison .
they keep a cell open for me , just in case i drop in .
you know the problem with these joints now .
health clubs for waffleeating pussies .
maybe we should think about upping our game here a little bit .
think about someplace truly diabolical .
what the hell is he thinking now .
hes thinking a triplemax prison . a nodaylight slam .
only three of them left in this system .
two of them out of range .
for a shitty little undercutter like this one with no legs .
leaving just one .
crematoria .
that is what you had in mind , right , toombs .
how does he know where were going , and we dont .
dope it out . i hate this run .
just do it .
dont know about this new crew of yours .
they seem a bit skittish .
probably shouldnt tell them what happened to the last crew .
you know , you were supposed to be some slickshit killer .
now look at you . all backofthebus and shit .
i say we attack helion two next . take it straight into their teeth .
itll cost you 20,000 heads , 5 warrior ships .
nothing more , i swear it . while i do prize brute force .
this approach is , perhaps , more artful .
start at the end . go straight to helion five .
the last planet in the system .
we approach from the night side .
remove these cannon first .
then attack the larger placements at speed .
well catch them on their rear flank .
and in 10 days time .
the rest of those worlds will tumble before us .
you see , as with most .
their blind spot is right behind them .
ive located an ion trail which leads offworld .
then you should be offworld , vaako .
ive deployed a tracker team . one of the best .
wherever riddick has gone .
you lens him out and cleanse him . you .
you want me to take a frigate for one breeder .
dont question it , vaako .
take it on faith .
hes always been unsettled around you .
the lord marshal . unsteady .
perhaps because he knows hes half the warrior you are .
some say hes too artistic for the job .
i wouldnt be surprised if someone promoted him soon .
to full dead .
take care what you say . should i say it softly .
so it sounds more like conspiracy .
why is it that when anyone breathes about the demise .
of him on the throne everyone assumes a conspiracy .
why isnt that just prudent planning .
when he is ready , he will name a successor .
who .
toal scales .
the purifier .
none of them .
with the strength , the dignity .
of lord vaako .
you can keep what you kill .
that is the necromonger way .
mercenaries . elementals . necromongers .
how unexpected .
an elemental . here .
one of the captives .
and why , after 30 years , should it be you .
he doesnt regard her as a captive , though .
elementals . they talk of neutrality , but theyre all witches and spies .
why else would they come and go like the wind .
but where has he gone where is the furyan hiding now .
you be the good warrior . go after this riddick .
ill find out why the lord marshal is so threatened by him .
destination reached . unlocking manual controls .
all right , i make 700 degrees on the day side .
300 below on the night side .
lets not get caught in the sun .
if i owned this place and hell , id rent this place out .
and live in hell .
slue angle: good . stand by .
and plotted course .
good . hit it .
angle of approach: not good .
look , ma , no hands .
party poppers .
i think i shit myself .
skittish , toombs . very skittish .
comfy .
when the rides over , your goggles are mine .
fourway split .
29.4 kilometres .
so this is riddick .
what in the bowels of christ are you talking about 700,000 .
dont take this one , boss .
see , anatoli here has a nose for trouble .
and this one , this riddick guy big , big trouble .
so 700,000 is good money .
id take the money , toombs .
these are dangerous days , if you believe the talk .
talk about dead planets .
about some ghost army .
about them .
them .
ill run the numbers again . it takes a couple of days probably .
so you can stay as my guest .
at least here we are all safe . yes .
yes , boss .
ill give it a day .
one .
there are inmates , and there are convicts .
a convict has a certain code .
and he knows to show a certain respect .
an inmate , on the other hand .
pulls the pin on his fellow man .
does the guards work for them . brings shame .
to the game .
so which are you gonna be .
im just passing through .
welcome to crematoria .
how do i get eyes like that you got to kill a few people .
did that . did a lot of that .
and then you got to get sent to a slam .
where youre told you wont see daylight again .
there wasnt a doctor who could shine my eyes .
not even for 20 menthol kools . was anything you said true .
what are you gonna do go for the sweet spot .
remember who youre talking to , jack .
jacks dead .
she was weak .
she couldnt cut it .
the names kyra now .
and im a new animal .
im so glad i could steal you away for a moment .
doesnt it strike you odd .
here we have the current lord marshal .
destroying entire societies .
and yet he cant bring himself to kill one stranded elemental .
why is that .
you dont pray to our god . you pray to no god , i hear .
elementals , we calculate .
dont we all .
but now lets have first things first .
what of riddick .
in truth , i dont know where he went .
in truth , im more interested in where he came from .
watch your step .
ive always wondered , does an air elemental fly .
now do me a favour .
calculate the odds of you getting off this planet alive .
and now cut them in half .
no , we cant fly . but we glide very well .
save your threats , necromonger .
i would have told you about riddick for the asking .
it concerns a foretelling .
a prediction now more than 30 years old .
a young warrior once consulted a seer of sorts .
and was told that he would die at the hands of a furyan .
so he waged a private war on the planet furya .
killing all he could find .
this was before he became lord marshal , of course .
that massacre should have ended the matter .
but now it seems one furyan had a knack .
for escape .
feeding time .
move lets go come on .
hurry .
to the cages .
a herd a goddamn herd is that all we are to you .
let me in .
wait .
its an animal thing .
check her for me . shes always got a blade somewhere .
i dont think she likes being touched .
id take my wounded and go while you still can .
is there a name for this private little world of yours .
what happens there when we dont just run away .
youll kill us with a soup cup .
tea , actually .
ill kill you with my tea cup .
you know the rule .
they arent dead if theyre still on the books .
death by tea cup .
damn . why didnt i think of that .
i didnt come here to play whos the better killer .
but its my favourite game . havent you heard .
i heard you came looking for me .
is that all then you missed the good part .
hooked up with some mercs out of lupus five .
said theyd take me on , teach me the trade , give me a good cut .
they slaved me out , riddick .
do you know what that could do to you when youre that age .
when youre 12 years old i told you to stay in new mecca .
did you not listen .
i had mercs on my neck . ill always have mercs on my neck .
i spent five years on a frozen heap just to keep them away from you .
and you go and sign up with the same fake badges .
that wanted to cut you up and use you for bait .
what are you pitching , riddick .
that you cutting out was a good thing .
that you had my ass covered from halfway across the universe .
you signed with mercs .
there was nobody else around .
lets pop the cork . get some fresh air .
so they do go topside .
to swap out air .
interesting .
who the hell are you .
when it happens , itll happen fast .
stay on my leg when i cut fence , or die here .
nobody outs this place . nobody .
he aint nobody .
seven hundred degrees .
jesus .
thats some sunrise .
no , thats not why im here at all .
good news first .
talked things over with my amigos here .
well cut you in for 775,000 .
all right . whats the bad news .
they close the local whorehouse .
no . the bad news is worse than that . much worse .
our pilot , he saw this .
it crossed a shipping lane .
any idea what this might be .
never saw nothing like it .
this ship charts back to helion prime .
you know , anatolis got a nose for trouble .
and he thinks trouble follows you here .
look , we dusted our tracks and got the hell out of there .
there is no way we didnt lose them .
this is my prisoner .
mine . nobody elses .
and i want my money now .
you stole a prisoner from them .
riddick , no .
shouldve taken the money , toombs .
mercs .
some guards here , but this cant be all of them .
check their slots in the back . and be careful .
dont bother . guards aint there .
they figured out the necros are coming for me .
plan was to clean the bank , ghost the mercs .
break wide through the tunnel .
then somebody got a lucky shot off with this rocket launcher here .
and took out the sled .
guards took off on foot .
but rigged the door so no one could follow .
theyll take the one ship in the hangar .
and leave everyone else here to die .
how come you know all this shit .
you werent even here .
cause it was my plan .
its moving in the right direction . we could make it .
stay behind the night .
ahead of the sun .
theres gonna be one speed .
mine .
if you cant keep up , dont step up . youll just die .
i shouldve taken the money .
up there .
take a look . because anatoli says so .
because his nose says so .
go come on , go .
climb here .
climb go .
theyre heading for the volcano fields .
going for our ship .
no chance do they get to the hangar first . no chance .
next one next hole well catch them there .
no more running for you .
where did the big guy go .
close it .
what was that you dont care if you live or die .
if i kill them first , not really .
maybe i do .
keep moving .
kyra .
kyra what .
get that ass moving .
remember what i said about not caring if i lived or died .
you knew i was kidding , right .
one speed .
your rope .
its too late . were never gonna make it .
your rope give me your rope .
and your water . all of it .
stay in the shadow of the mountain .
dont wait for me . run .
where the hell is that hangar .
there it is .
listen .
let me guess . necros .
one commander .
five captains . and a whole lot of necro firepower .
shit i hate not being the bad guys .
i figure we got three minutes .
before the sun hits us again , burns out this whole valley .
we gonna do this or not .
just wait .
remember that favourite game of yours .
whos the better killer .
lets play .
on the right .
hand .
i was supposed to deliver a message to you .
if vaako failed to kill you .
a message from the lord marshal himself .
he tells you to stay away from helion .
stay away from him .
and in return , youll be hunted no more .
but vaako will most likely report you as dead .
so this is your chance .
your chance to do what no man has ever done .
the girl .
where will they take her .
to the lord marshal , of course .
ive done unbelievable things .
in the name of a faith that was never my own .
and hell do to her what he did to me .
the necromonger in me warns you not to go back .
but the furyan in me .
hopes you wont listen .
we all began as something else .
i have lost a purifier .
but i have gained a first among commanders .
it is overdue , isnt it .
that we acknowledge your many accomplishments .
your steady faith .
your unflinching loyalty .
obedience without question . loyalty till underverse come .
well done , vaako .
this is a day of days .
now , tell me if its true .
tell me the furyan is gone .
and i can close this campaign without hearing his bootsteps .
if he is dead .
i sense im not far from the same fate .
being of no further use here .
shouldnt i tell you that riddick is still alive .
dont try me , aereon .
i could plough you under with the rest of helion prime .
no one really knows the future .
then tell me the odds .
that vaako met with success .
that i will now be the one who can finish it all .
conquering or converting all the remaining worlds of man .
tell me its true , aereon .
and maybe ill save your home world .
for last .
the odds are good .
that riddick is still alive .
ascension protocol .
we still have numbers out there , lord marshal .
sweep teams , recon ships .
they would be hardpressed to make it back .
get my armada off the ground .
you mean on helion i mean here on this very ship .
could you be wrong .
mind fabricates fear . could you be wrong .
not so wrong as you when you left him alive .
its twice a mistake .
not only your failure , but now the report of success .
how do we salvage this how .
lord marshals got to be warned .
you will never see the underverse .
he will kill us both before our due time .
i say give riddick his chance .
if he is half of what you think .
he can at least wound the lord marshal .
and that is when you must act .
just to take his place just to keep what i kill .
that is the necromonger way .
it is not enough then you do it for the faith .
if he has fear , he has weakness .
if he has weakness , vaako .
he is unworthy of lordship .
we do it for all necromongers .
protect the faith .
this can still be a day of days .
but the timing must .
be flawless .
final protocol . execute on my order .
were done with this world .
go inside .
ziza , go inside .
we found this lensor dead .
show me his last sight .
commander toal .
he wont escape twice .
stay your weapons .
he came for me .
consider this .
if you fall here now .
youll never rise .
but if you choose another way .
the necromonger way .
go to him .
it hurts .
at first .
but after a while , the pain goes away , just as they promise .
are you with me , kyra .
theres a moment when you can almost see the underverse through his eyes .
he makes it sound perfect .
a place where anyone can start over .
are you with me , kyra .
convert now .
or fall forever .
you killed everything i know .
vaako .
not yet .
been a long time since ive seen my own blood .
these are his last moments .
give me your soul , furyan .
never .
you are not the one to bring me down .
now kill the beast while hes wounded .
help me , vaako .
kill him .
forgive me .
flawless .
i thought you were dead .
i was always with you .
i was .
you keep what you kill .
now , what would be the odds of that .
this dark army at the feet of a ione outlaw .
and the fate of the rest of the universe .
not even i dare to calculate that .
in order to effect a timely halt to deteriorating conditions .
and to ensure the common good , .
a state of emergency is declared for these territories .
by decree of lord cutler beckett , .
duly appointed representative of his majesty the king .
by decree according to martial law , .
the following statutes are temporarily amended: .
right to assembly: .
suspended .
right to habeas corpus: .
right to legal counsel: .
right to verdict by a jury of peers: .
by decree , all persons found guilty of piracy .
or aiding a person convicted of piracy .
or associating with a person convicted of piracy .
shall be sentenced to hang by the neck until death .
lord beckett .
theyve started to sing , sir .
finally .
for any who are ignorant of his meaning .
particularly a woman .
particularly a woman alone .
what makes you think shes alone .
you protect her .
and what makes you think i need protecting .
your masters expecting us .
and an unexpected death would cast a slight pall on our meeting .
have you heard anything from will .
i trust young turner to acquire the charts .
and you to remember your place in the presence of captain sao feng .
is he that terrifying .
hes much like myself , but absent my merciful nature and sense of fair play .
do you think because she is a woman we would not suspect her of treachery .
well , when you put it that way .
remove .
please .
captain barbosa , .
welcome to singapore .
more steam .
none of that . if things dont go the way they want , then were the only chance theyve got .
i understand that you have a request to make of me .
more of a proposal to put thee .
ive a venture underway , and i find myself in need of a ship and a crew .
its an odd coincidence .
because you happen to have a ship and a crew you dont need .
because earlier this day , no far from here , .
a thief broke into my most revered uncles temple .
and tried to make home with these .
the navigational charts .
the route to the farthest ticket .
wouldnt it be amazing if this venture of yours .
took you to the world beyond this one .
it would strain credulity , at that .
this is the thief .
is his face familiar to you .
then i guess .
he has no further need for it .
you come into my city .
and you betray my hospitality .
sao feng , i assure you , i had no idea .
that he would get caught .
you intend to attempt a voyage to davy jones locker .
but i cannot help but wonder .
the song has been sung .
the time is upon us .
we must convene the brethren court .
as one of the nine pirate lords .
you must honor the call .
there is a price on all our heads .
it is true .
and since the only way a pirate can turn a profit anymore .
is by betraying .
other pirates .
its the time to put our differences aside wait for the signal .
the first .
now that rule is being challenged by lord cutler beckett .
against east india trading company , .
what value is the brethren court .
you can fight .
get off me .
you are sao feng , the pirate lord of singapore .
would you have that era come to an end on your watch .
the most notorious pirates from around the world .
are uniting against our enemy , .
and yet you sit here cowering in your bathwater .
elizabeth swann .
there is more to you than meets the eye , .
isnt there .
and the eye .
does not go wanting .
but i cannot help but notice .
you have failed to answer my question: .
what is it you seek in davy jones locker .
jack sparrow .
hes one of the pirate lords .
the only reason .
i would jack sparrow return from the land of the dead .
is so i can send him back myself .
jack sparrow holds one of the nine pieces of eight .
he failed to pass it along to a successor before he died .
so we must go and get him back .
so .
you admit .
you have deceived me .
weapons .
sao feng , i assure you , our intentions are strictly honorable .
drop your weapons .
or i kill the man .
kill him . hes not our man .
if hes not with you and hes not with us .
who is he with .
set , fire .
doublez .
set .
its an odd coincidence , isnt it .
the east india trading company finds me the day you show up in singapore .
it is coincidence only .
if you want to make a deal with beckett , .
you need what i offer .
you crossed barbosa .
you are willing to cross jack sparrow .
why should i expect any better .
i need the black pearl to free my father .
youre helping me to get it .
thank you , jack .
you have the charts .
and better yet .
a ship with a crew .
wheres sao feng .
hell cover our escape and meet us in shipwreck cove .
hold it stiff into the wind .
theres no place left for sao feng to cower .
do you think he will honor the call .
i cannot say .
there is an evil and disease .
that even the most staunch and bloodthirsty pirates have come to fear .
a piece of eight .
nine of them , you say .
our new friend in singapore was very specific , sir .
nine pieces of eight .
whats the significance of that , i wonder .
does it matter .
nothing can hold against the armada . not even the flying dutchman , i believe .
nothing we know of .
did your friend happen to mention where the brethren court are meeting .
he was mum on that , sir .
then he knows the value of information .
better keep this between ourselves .
we dont want anyone running off to singapore , do we .
ah , admiral .
you summoned me , lord beckett .
yes . something for you there .
your new station deserves an old friend .
not more requisition orders .
no sir .
execution .
the brethren know they face extinction .
all that remains is for them to decide where they make their final stand .
no one said anything about cold .
im sure there must be a good reason for our suffering .
why dont that woman just bring jack back , .
the same way she brought back barbosa .
because barbosa was only dead .
jack sparrow is taken in body and soul .
to a place not of death .
but punishment .
the worst fate a person can bring upon himself .
stretching on forever .
thats what awaits in davy jones locker .
i mean , that was a good reason .
nothing here is said .
it is hardly as accurate as modern charts . no .
but it leads to more places .
over the edge .
over again .
sunrise sets flash of green .
do you care to interpret , .
ever gazed upon the green flash , master gibbs .
i reckon ive seen my fair share .
happens on rare occasion , .
at the last glimpse of sunset , a green flash shoots up into the sky .
some go their whole lives without ever seeing it .
some claimed to have seen it who aint . and some say .
it signals when a soul comes back to this world .
from the dead .
sorry .
trust me , young master turner , .
its not getting to the land of the dead thats the problem .
its getting back .
back to lift the sail aye , aye , sir .
bloody hell , theres nothing left .
jones is a loose cannon , sir .
fetch the chest .
and the governour .
hes been asking questions about the heart .
does he know .
then perhaps his usefulness has run its course .
steady , men .
all of you .
and take that infernal thing with you .
i will not have it on my ship .
oh , im sorry to hear that .
because i will .
because it seems to me the only way to ensure .
that this ship do as directed by the company .
we need prisoners to interrogate , .
which tends to work best when theyre alive .
the dutchman sails as its captain commands .
and its captain is to sail it as commanded .
i would have thought youd learned that when i had ordered you to kill your pet .
this is no longer your world , jones .
the immaterial .
charge . .
how long will we continue not talking .
once we rescue jack , everything will be fine .
then we rescue jack .
there is a cost must be payed in the end .
barbosa .
ahead .
aye , were good and lost now .
lost .
for certain you have to be lost to find a place as cant be found .
elseways everyone would know where it was .
were gaining speed aye .
to stations .
all hands to stations .
haul the away .
never lay down .
let her run straight .
blimey .
were doomed , thats all .
dont be so unkind .
you may not survive to pass this way again .
and these are the last friendly words youll hear .
all to port .
.
, slack em braces .
aye , captain .
slack em braces .
step loudly .
down below .
help ye filthy toads .
.
aye , sir .
mr sparrow aye , captain .
what say you about the condition of this tackon .
it be proper to my eye , sir .
proper .
it is neither proper nor suitable , sir , it is not acceptable , nor adequate , .
it is an obvious fact .
an abomination .
begging your pardon , sir , but perhaps if you gave a man another chance .
shall i .
that sort of thinking got us into mess .
we have lost speed , and therefore time .
precious time , .
which cannot be recovered once lost .
do you understand aye , aye , captain .
do you now it will all have to be redone .
all of it .
and let this serve as a lesson to the lot of you .
doldrum , sir , .
has the entire crew on edge .
i have no sympathy for any of you feculant maggots , .
and no more patience to pretend otherwise .
gentlemen , i wash my hands of this weirdness .
no wind .
of course theres no bloody wind .
my soul , i do swear for the place .
gust , whisper , .
tiny miniature lick .
yes sir , i know , but why why would he do that .
because hes a lummox , isnt he .
we shall have a magnificent garden party , .
and youre not invited , .
a rock .
now were being followed by rocks . never heard that before .
oh a rope .
this truly is a godforsaken place .
i dont see jack .
i dont see anyone .
davy jones never once gave up that what he took .
and does it matter .
were trapped here by your doing . no different than jack .
witty jack is closer than you think .
impossible .
slap me thrice n hand me to me momma its jack .
its the captain sword .
jack mr gibbs .
aye , captain i thought so .
i expect youre able to account for your actions then .
there has been a perpetual and virulent lack of discipline on my vessel why .
why is that , sir .
sir , youre youre in davy jones locker , captain .
i know that .
i know where i am . and dont think i dont .
ah , hector . its been too long , hasnt it .
aye . illy doo mooahrtay , remember .
you shot me .
no i didnt .
tia dalma out and about , aye .
you add an agreeable sense of macabre to any delirium .
he thinks were a hallucination .
william , tell me something .
have you come because you need my help to save a certain distressing damsel , .
or rather damsel distress .
either one .
well , then you wouldnt be here , would you .
so you cant be here .
q.e.d . , youre not really here .
jack .
this is real . were here .
weve come to rescue you .
oh , youre not .
very kind of you .
but it would seem that as i possess a ship and you dont , .
youre the ones in need of rescuing , .
and im not sure as im in the mood .
i see my ship .
right there .
cant spot it .
must be a tiny little thing , hiding somewhere behind the pearl .
jack , cutler beckett has the heart of davy jones .
he controls the flying dutchman . hes taking over the seas .
the song has already been sung .
the brethren court is called .
leave you people alone for just a minute , look what happens everythings gone to pot .
aye , jack , the world needs you back .
and you need a crew .
why should i sail with any of you .
four of you have tried to kill me in the past . one of you succeeded .
oh shes not told you .
youll have loads to talk about while youre here .
as for you .
now , dont tell me you didnt enjoy it the other day .
fair enough all right , you lady .
dont need you . you scare me .
what gives , you can come . marty .
cotton .
parrot at least ill have someone to talk to .
who are you tai huang .
these are my men .
i have a ship .
that makes you the highest bidder .
good man .
anchor . all hands , prepare to make sail .
which way are you going , jack .
what are you doing what are you doing .
no , what are you doing .
what are you doing .
the captain gives orders on the ship .
the captain of this ship is giving orders .
my ship , makes me captain .
they be my charts .
that makes you chartman .
stow away .
dont move you thats an order understand .
sorry .
i just thought , with the captain issue and all , id throw in my name for consideration .
id vote for you . yes .
you left jack to the kraken .
hes rescued now . its done with .
will , i had no choice .
you chose not to tell me .
i couldnt .
it wasnt your burden to bear .
well , i did bear it , didnt i .
i just didnt know what it was .
i thought .
you thought i loved him .
if you make your choices alone , .
how can i trust you .
you cant .
eerie .
thats downright macabree .
i wonder what would happen if you dropped a cannonball on one of them .
be disrespectful , you would .
they should be in the care of davy jones .
that was the duty im was charged with .
by the goddess calypso , .
to ferry those who die at sea to the other side .
and every ten years , .
im could come ashore .
to be with she o love im .
truly .
but the man has become a monster .
so he wasnt always tentacly .
im was a man .
once .
now theres boats coming .
theyre not a threat to us .
am i right .
we are nothing but ghosts to them .
weve better as just let them be .
its my father weve made it back .
father father , im up here .
elizabeth .
were not back .
are you dead .
i think i am .
no , you cant be .
there was this chest , .
you see .
i thought .
at the time it seemed so important .
come on board .
and a heart .
i learnt that if you stab the heart , .
yours must take its place , .
and you will sail the seas for eternity .
the dutchman must have a captain .
silly thing to die for .
someone cast a line .
come back with us .
i told you , im destiny .
take the line .
i was so proud of you , elizabeth .
she must not leave the ship father .
please come with us please dont leave me .
ill give your love to your mother , shall i .
i wont let you go elizabeth .
he made peace .
rums gone , too .
if we cannot escape these doldrums .
before night , .
i fear we will sail .
on trackless seas , .
doomed to between worlds forever .
with no water , forever looks to be arriving a mite too soon .
why doesnt he do something .
me eye give it back .
theres no sense to it .
and the green flash happens at sunset .
not sunrise .
god , driving me over the blooming edge .
sunrises dont set .
up is down .
well , thats just maddeningly unhelpful .
why are these things never clear .
clear as mud , jacky . what .
stab the heart . dont stem the heart .
come again .
the dutchman must have a captain .
well , thats even more than less than unhelpful .
sail the seas for eternity .
i love the sea . what about port .
i prefer rum .
rums good .
making port , .
where we can get rum and salty wenches .
once every ten years .
what did you say .
ten years is a long time , mate .
even longer , given the deficit of rum .
but eternity is longer still .
and how will you be spending it .
dead or not .
the immortal captain sparrow .
well , id love that .
come sunset , it wont matter .
sundown and rise .
up .
what do you think .
where .
there .
what is it .
were rocking the ship .
aye , hes on to it .
hes rocking the ship .
we tie each other to the mast upside down , so when the boat flips well be the right way up .
swell .
loose the cannons , you .
unstow the cargo .
let it surf .
now up .
is down .
blessed sweet westerlies .
were back .
theres the sunrise .
we need our pistols . get untied , alright .
alright then .
the brethren court has a gathering at shipwreck cove , .
and jack , you and i are agoing , and therell be no arguing that point .
i is arguing the point .
if these pirates are gathering , im pointing my ship the other way .
the pirates are gathering to fight beckett , and youre a pirate .
fight or not , youre not running , jack .
if we dont stand together , theyll hunt us down one by one , till there be none left but you .
quite like the sound of it .
captain jack sparrow .
the last pirate .
aye , and youll be fighting jones alone .
how does that figure into your plan .
im still working on that .
but i will not be going back to the locker , nay .
count on that .
why , we can still use them as clubs .
effective , though .
theres a freshwater spring on this island .
we can resupply there and get back to shooting each other later .
you lead the shore party . ill stay with my ship .
im not leaving my ship in your command .
why dont you both go ashore and leave the ship in my command .
temporarily .
criminy .
odds bodkins .
careful careful .
you stupid fish actually , its a cephalopod .
youre right . i bet people will pay a shilling to see this .
and another shilling for a sketch from seeing it drop .
slayers .
we could a slice as a souvenir .
still thinking of running , jack .
think you can outrun the world .
you know , the problem .
with being the last of anything .
by and by , therell be none left at all .
sometimes things come back , mate .
were living proof , you and me .
aye , but thats a gamble of luck now , aint it .
theres never a guarantee of coming back .
passing on , thats dead certain .
summoning the brethren court then , is it .
its our only hope left .
thats a sad commentary in and of itself .
the world used to be a bigger place .
the worlds still the same .
theres just less in it .
poisoned . fouled by the body .
aye , i know him he was in singapore .
singapore .
we got company .
hes the captain .
sao feng you showing up here , .
it is truly a remarkable coincidence .
you paid me great insult once .
that doesnt sound like me .
so we just call it square then .
release her .
shes not part of the bargain .
and what bargain be that .
you heard captain turner .
release her .
captain turner aye , the perfidious rotter lead a mutiny against us .
i need the pearl to free my father .
thats the only reason i came on this voyage .
why didnt you tell me you were planning this .
that was my burden to bear .
he needs the pearl captain turner needs the pearl .
and you felt guilty .
and you and your brethren court .
did no one come to save me just because they missed me .
im standing over there with him .
im sorry , jack .
but there is an old friend who wants to see you first .
im not certain i can survive any more visits from old friends .
if youre so jealous to find out .
curious .
your friends appear to be quite desperate , jack .
perhaps they no longer believe that a gathering of squabbling pirates can defeat the flying dutchman .
and so despair leads to betrayal .
but you and i are no strangers to betrayal , .
are we .
its not here , jack .
what what isnt .
the heart of davy jones . its safely aboard the dutchman , .
and so unavailable for you sirs leverage to satisfy your debt to the good captain .
by my reckoning , that account has been settled .
by your death .
and yet here you are .
close your eyes and pretend its all a bad dream . thats how i get by .
and if davy jones were to learn of your survival .
on your guard , men .
my men are crew enough .
company ship , company crew .
he agreed . the black pearl was to be mine .
and so it was .
perhaps you consider an alternative arrangement .
one which requires absolutely nothing from you .
but information .
regarding the brethren court no doubt .
in exchange for fair compensation .
square my debt with jones , .
guarantee my freedom .
of course . its just good business .
were i in a divulgeatory mood , .
what then might i divulge .
everything .
where are they meeting .
who are the pirate lords .
what is the purpose of the nine pieces of eight .
beckett agreed . the black pearl wants to be mine .
lord becketts not gonna give up the only ship as can outrun the dutchman , is he .
shame that youre not bound to honor the code of the brethren , isnt it .
because honors a hard thing to come by nowadays .
there is no honor to remain with the losing side .
leaving it for the winning side .
is just good business .
the losing side , you say .
they have the dutchman .
now the pearl .
and what do the brethren have .
we have calypso .
calypso .
an old legend .
the goddess herself , bound in human form .
imagine all the power as you see is brought to bear against our enemy .
i intend to release her , .
but for that i need the brethren court .
all the court .
then keep barbosa , .
the belligerent homunculus and his friend with the wooden eye , both , .
and turner .
especially turner .
the rest go with me aboard the pearl , and ill lead you to shipwreck cove , .
where i will hand you the pirates , and you will not hand me to jones .
bloody fair deal , dont you think .
and what becomes of miss swann .
what interest is she to you .
what are you proposing , captain .
what be accepted captain .
the girl .
ive just recalled ive got this wonderful compass , .
which points to whatever i want .
so for what do i need you .
elizabeth is not part of any bargain .
it was not a question .
point you to the thing you want most and that is not the brethren court , is it .
then what is , jack .
dead .
you got us into this mess . if this is what frees us , then done .
although if i kill you , then i can use the compass to find shipwreck cove , is it .
on my own .
cut out the middleman , as it were .
elizabeth , they are pirates .
i have had more than enough experience dealing with pirates .
then we have an accord .
with me killed , youd arrive at the cove .
to find its a stronghold nigh impregnable , .
able to withstand blockade for years , .
and then youd be wishing , .
oh , if only there were someone i had not killed .
inside , to ensure that the pirates then come outside .
and you can accomplish all this , can you .
you may kill me , but you may never insult me .
who am i .
im captain jack sparrow .
by this time tomorrow , we will arrive at shipwreck cove , and you will be free .
not a name you fancy , id imagine , out of the many that you have .
but it is what we call you .
we being who .
you confirm it .
confirm what .
youve told me nothing . the brethren court , not i .
the first brethren court whose decision i would have opposed .
they bound you to human form so the rule of the seas .
would belong to man and not to me .
but one such as you should never be anything less than what you are .
pretty speech from a captor .
but words whispered through prison bars lose their charm .
can i be blamed for my efforts .
all men are drawn to the sea , perilous though it may be .
and some men offer desire as justification for their crimes .
i offer simply my desire .
and in return .
i would have your gifts , should you choose to give them .
and if i should choose .
not .
then i will take .
your fury .
sao feng .
come here . please .
with all nine pieces of eight , .
you will be free .
you are captain now .
go on my place to shipwreck cove .
forgive me , calypso .
what did he tell you .
he made me captain .
you are not my captain .
james .
your father will be overjoyed to know youre safe .
my father is dead .
no , that cant be true . he returned to england .
did lord beckett tell you that .
who among you do you name as captain .
captain her .
captain tow the ship .
put the prisoners in the brig .
the captain shall have my quarters . thank you , sir .
but i prefer to remain with my crew .
i swear i did not know .
know what .
which side you chose .
well , now you do .
you know my name .
yes . i know your son .
will turner .
he made it .
hes alive .
and now he sends you to tell me that hes coming to get me .
godswoons , hes on his way .
yes , will is alive .
and he wants to help you .
he cant help me .
he wont come .
but youre his father .
i know you .
he spoke of you .
he cant save me .
he cant come because of you .
youre elizabeth .
yes , im elizabeth .
if jones be slain , he who slays him must take his place .
captain forever .
the dutchman must always have a captain .
and if he saves me , .
he loses you .
you wont pick me .
i wouldnt pick me .
tell him not to come .
tell him to stay away .
tell him its too late .
im already a part of the ship .
and the crew .
bootstrap .
yes , i knew your son .
hes coming for me .
wait and see .
youll see .
he promised .
sir .
a breadcrumb trail , and we are meant to follow .
a betrayer among them .
or a trap .
a gambit by a skilled opponent .
adjust course , lieutenant .
we can only hope to reach our destination .
before they run out of bodies .
you escaped the brig even quicker than i expected .
do you notice anything .
rather , .
do you notice something that is not there to be noticed .
you havent raised an alarm .
odd , isnt it .
not as odd as this .
come up with this all by you alone , did you .
i said to myself: think like jack .
this is what youve arrived at .
leave beckett the shipwreck cove so as to gain his trust , .
accomplish your own ends .
its like you dont know me at all , mate .
and how does your dearly beloved feel about this plan .
youve not seen fit to trust her with this .
im losing it , jack .
every step i make for my father is a step away from elizabeth .
mate , if you choose to love your heart away , youll lose it for certain .
if i might lend a machete to your intellectual thicket , .
why , the choice is all to give up .
changes effects .
let someone else dispatch jones .
you .
death has a curious way of reshuffling ones priorities .
ill slip aboard the dutchman , find the heart , stab the beating thing , your father goes free from his debt .
youre free to be with your charming murderess .
and youre willing to cut out your heart and bind yourself to the dutchman .
forever .
no , mate . im free forever .
free to sail the seas beyond the edges of the map . free from death itself .
youll have to do the job though , jack .
youll have to ferry souls to the next world .
or end up just like jones .
i dont have the face for tentacles .
but a mortal has to care for something , aye .
whats this for .
a thing like me . itll come to you .
my regards to davy jones .
i hate him .
come with me .
quickly .
do not go to shipwreck cove .
beckett knows of the meeting of the brethren .
i fear there may be a traitor among them .
its too late to own my forgiveness .
i had nothing to do with your fathers death .
that does not absolve me of my other sins .
come with us .
james , come with me .
who goes there .
i will follow .
youre lying .
our destinies have been entwined , elizabeth .
but never joined .
go now .
back to your station , sailor .
no one leaves the ship .
stand down . thats an order .
thats an order .
part of the crew , part of the ship .
part of the crew , part of the ship steady , man .
part of the crew , part of the ship who runs prisoner escapes .
relay that .
day after day .
the store that one might .
i hate television . it gives me headaches .
theres so many magnetic waves traveling in the airspace .
because of tv and television , were losing .
10 times as many brain cells as were supposed to .
oh , please .
the cow says blank .
three letters .
dude .
i dont know . magnetic waves , brain cells .
i dont understand the connection between that stuff .
you know what else i heard .
magnetic waves shrink silicone molecules .
oh , my god turn it off .
its not working .
its backwards .
what do we do i dont know .
that was kind of scary .
i know something even scarier . what .
have you heard about this videotape .
where they do it on the boat and then in the car .
and then in the bathtub .
hes like , baby , i love you . and shes like , where are we .
and did you see the no .
not that tape . oh .
the one with all the scary images .
after you watch the tape , the phone rings .
and this scary voice comes on and says youre gonna die in .
seven days . i saw that one with josh last weekend .
you were with josh last weekend .
oh , yes , i was .
oh , you ho .
oh .
aah .

ross .
im sorry . i wasnt listening .

i want you to take a look at this for that strip club expos� .

call it womens intuition or espn or both .
but i can tell when dangers near .
ow my eyes .
cindy , its sweeps month . ratings mean everything .

like the one you did yesterday .
the report on breast augmentation .

some old tupac , sir .
all eyez on me . hey , this shit is banging .
thank you , sir . i appreciate it .
hello , cindy .
i am the architect .
you have many questions .
ive been watching you for a very long time .
so i see .
what is the connection between the crop circles and the tape .
the answer is simple .
you are the eventuality of an anomaly .
you are inexorably seeking a sedulant probability .
sedulant .
grotesquerie no .
what about contingent affirmation .
thats got to mean something . hey .
hey you put cameras in my bathroom .
oh , my god . well , it was a long winter .
this is an invasion of ow .
oh , sorry .
i cant help it . its very ionely in here .
ergo , i havent been with anyone in a very long time , .
or this chair .
i call her .
linda .
could you just cut to the chase im kind of in a rush .
why you can always sleep over if you want .
lindas built for two , and she vibrates .
stop it just tell me what i need to know .
who is that little girl .
okay , okay .
my wife and i wanted a child , but she couldnt get pregnant .
neither could i .
so you adopted .
we loved our daughter , but she was evil .
made the horses crazy , killed our puppies , .
hid the remote .
really sick shit .
my wife took her to the old family farm .
and drowned her in the well .
i felt a simple timeout would have been sufficient .
but tabitha imprinted her evil on a videotape .
i never meant for it to get out , but .
but what .
i put it in the wrong box and returned it to blockbuster , .
instead of my copy of pootie tang .
its been circulating and killing ever since .
just like pootie tang .
but what does this have to do with aliens .
perhaps tabithas summoning them to kill us all .
an alien invasion .
i have to warn the world .
its already begun . youre too late .
but not too late to make an old man happy .
what .
and now reports of lights in the sky .
glimpses of spacecraft .
possible alien sightings being reported all over the world .
are they aliens .

the nation , while not yet panicked , is deeply disturbed .

keeping everybody deeply disturbed .
we dont want a panic .

ill slap you to kingdom come .
look at those foureyes carting around a coffin .
what morons .
dont blame me for making you leave .
well let buddha decide .
whether you stay .
or go .
horrifically bad fate .
have some tea .
were grateful for some professional help .
we understand the problem . twelve kicks from the tam school .
iron fist from the hung school and the hexagon staff .
those guys at pig sty are really good .
their warrior days are long over .
but theyre still top fighters .
this job is a great challenge for us .
now , thats professionalism .
number one killers . expensive , yes , but worth every penny .
number one is the beast , the worlds top killer .
he was so dedicated to kung fu , he went crazy .
i heard hes now in an asylum .
so youre the top killers now .
strictly speaking , were just musicians .
a song that wrenches the heart o where do i find a knowing ear .
great poem , isnt it .
well be saying goodbye soon .
who knows when well see each other again .
were three of a kind . wish wed known before .
lets take this opportunity to spar a little .
no . we still have a lot to pack .
youre right .
twelve kicks of the tam school superb attack and defense .
iron fist: powerful yet delicate . topnotch .
hexagon staff , with its thousand moves . mystical .
till we meet again .
more lipstick .
stay there , or ill break you in half .
sorry , were closed .
you can make a suit in no time .
were moving .
this is good material .
you know your stuff .
this has high artistic value .
how high .
at least a few stories .
insulting the axe gang well show them .
lets kill them all and make this place a brothel .
dont block my view .
whats going on .
damn i told those nitwits to leave , but theyre still here .
really yeah .
what the hell is this fighting wholl pay for the damage .
sorry , sorry . its nothing .
you know what time it is i have to sleep .
hey , fatso , eat shit and die .
die in this racket .
sorry , sorry .
get out of my way .
hang in there , tailor .
be quiet .
give us a break why push us so far .
theres another master .

thats the last well see of them .
its bad , brother sum . quick , start the car .
start the car .
keep it down have you no manners .
get lost . people are trying to sleep .
they have to work tomorrow . get out of here .
scumbags .
i cant hang on much longer .
but having seen real masters like you .
i can now die in peace .
dont say that .
were ordinary folks .
ordinarys a blessing .
dont call us masters .
but youre such great fighters .
if only youd helped earlier , they wouldnt have to die this way .
like donut said , everyone has his reasons .
years ago .
we saw our only son killed in a fight .
revenge can be devastating .
do you understand .
why dont you train us to be top fighters .
and well avenge them .
becoming a top fighter takes time .
unless youre a naturalborn kungfu genius .
and theyre one in a million .
its obvious im the one .
dont think so .
everyone we swore wed never fight again .
but we broke that promise today .
for your own safety , please all leave .
in great power lies great responsibility .
theres no escaping from it .
donut , youre hurt bad .
rest now .
we cant understand what youre saying .
i know you , foureyes .
you seem prejudiced against the sightchallenged .
thats right . especially goldframed foureyes .
gold frames are perfect for clerks .
i think i look good . so why keep picking on me .
help me help me want to play , punks .
the dragon style the tiger style .
come down here , and ill smash your glasses . come on .
you know id do it , right .
swear to it .
swear .
have you no respect where were you when i needed you .
you sound like a wimp .
we always get beat we havent gotten anywhere .
no killing , no arson , no robberies , no rapes .
all because of you .
youre a numbnut .
follow me .
its a stickup wheres the money .
wheres the money .
whatre you looking at im serious .
i kill people for less give me the money .
the moneys in here .
let go of the girl .
hes a fool , and shes mute . losers .
go away youre dragging me down .
go home and raise pigs .
go , before i kill you .
you whatsyourname .
take this and get some new clothes . youre now an axe .
for real someones waiting for you .
one look at you , and i knew youd do anything .
you just needed your chance .
damn right .
weve an assignment for you .
anything , brother sum .
research on abnormal people . whats that .
a mental asylum .
soldiers .
boy scouts .
tanks .
no worries .
when the boy scouts change shifts , you have exactly five minutes .
follow the arrows on the map . go to the last cell .
and get the man inside there out . heres your tools .
what about you guys .
were your lookouts .
five minutes . hurry .
the worlds top killer indeed looks the part .
its only a title .
cut the bullshit . we want two people killed . name your price .
name my what .
ive killed so many trying to find a worthy adversary .
so far , ive never found one .
thats why i stayed inside .
had i met my match , id have been out long ago .
if you find me a worthy opponent .
ill do it for free . no charge .
do you have someone .
yes . brilliant fighters who are up to the challenge .
but first , will you show us some moves .
not that we dont trust you . we want to see you in action .
you numskulls arent worthy .
he doesnt look the part .
the slippers are a little crappy . but hell clean up well .
you sure you got the right guy .
absolutely . i swear i did exactly what you told me .
please show us some moves , mr . beast . dont make it hard for me .
you dumb or what .
you know what this is , old man .
ever seen a fist this big .
dont force me to fight . i scare myself when i fight .
really try me , then .
is he okay .
so you say you can fight .
harder .
you hit like that and call yourself a gangster .
a foreign gun .
in the world of kung fu , speed defines the winner .
the beast is the best of them all .
the axe gang extends its respect .
the real masters , together in one room .
only the worlds top killer .
has such an aura .
likewise .
could you two be the fated lovers .
paris .
and helen of troy .
a pleasure , indeed .
were here to deal with the axe gang .
and only the axe gang .
you shouldve killed me before .
now youre committing suicide .
youre living on borrowed time .
you cant escape your fate .
whats this a funeral bell .
with the beast here , lets see whose funeral it is .
so youre on their side .
dont get me wrong .
i only want to kill you .
or be killed by you .
what do you think .
the good cannot coexist with the bad . you cant escape your destiny .
so be it . lets do it .
lets do it .
piece of cake . i can handle this .
good try , but a little off target .
the lions roar .
i didnt know the lions roar could be done with a speaker .
what a blow .
looks like theyre not up to it lets get them while theyre down .
im gonna puke i need to see a doctor go to hell .
you come over here .
hit him yes .
the head of course .
heres your chance . got it .
hit him hit him .
hit the shit out of him right .
beat the shit out of him .
whatre you doing .
you want me to hit him or beat the shit out of him .
youre making me very confused .
wow , thats a big fist .
why did you hit me .
where are they .
how could you let them escape .
no one gets away from me .
why did he save us .
young people make mistakes .
but at least he finally made good .
look at him beaten to a pulp .
do you have any last requests .
hey , wait .
why dont you write in chinese i dont understand .
theres no one here .
chinese medicine .
its a miracle he lasted this long .
the herbs should help him .
herbal medicine can only partly help . the key is his own body structure .
all his bones and tendons are broken .
its amazing hes recovering so fast .
it cant be possible .
unless hes .
whats that smell .
you mustnt smoke while youre hurt .
let me handle this .
this makes no sense .
who knew the beast could clear the chi flow .
and thus unleash the boys true potential .
we shouldve guessed .
he is the one .
is this for real .
youre still alive , you turncoat .
what kind of move is that .
kids stuff .
if our son were alive , hed be his age now .
if he studies hard , he could grow up to be a doctor or lawyer .
a stuntman , more likely .
not bad . lets go .
i can even stop bullets .
what the toad style of the kwan lun school .
oh , no .
remember the palm move that falls from heaven .
thats the long lost buddhist palm .
what kind of move was that .

and he kept talking about you , and the girls , and he said that. .
no matter what happen , he wanted to make sure you are all okay. .
and then he tripled his death benefit .

1632 , a dutch trading company move off the coast of carolina. .
a hysterical woman claimed. .
to have walked through the aftermath of a terrible hurricane that have not happen yet .
so , what happened .
they hung her for being a witch .
two days later , the entire town was wiped out by a force of hurricane .
it is awful .
let us get ahead to the 20th century .
boston , 1918 .
at the height of the influence of epidermis .
a father told a friend he has been to the future. .
he has seen a grave of a two small children .
the autopsy showed that the children were never infected .
he shot himself a week later .
who are these people , why did it happen .
you see. .
history is full of unexplained phenomena. .
nobody knows why .
some people thought , they suffered from what the ancients called. .
blasphemer absence fades .
the dangers of the fatales .
the fatales .
even spiritual .
people who have lost their belief. .
they are like empty vessels .
they are more susceptible of having their life taken over by a force that is bigger than they are .
it is almost like a curse .
or a miracle .
yeah , but i do not believe in miracles .
every day , we are alive can be a miracle .
i do not feel that right , not for me .
something bad is going to happen .
i need your help , i need your direction. .
i need faith .
faith , it just believes something behind you. .
something you cannot feel , or smell , or touch. .
like hope . or love. .
i believe i have let that all go .
maybe you should try to get it back again , huh .
but if it is too late .
it is never too late to realize what is important in your life. .
to fight for it .
i do not know what to fight for .

sue . what are you .
general hager .
lets talk somewhere private .
unless you need to do jello shots off someones stomach .
this was johnnys idea . i just went along .
how does reed know the general .
a few years back , the guy was pushing a new missiledefense system .
reed testified that the technology wouldnt work .
im here on direct orders from the joint chiefs of staff .
personally , i dont like sharing sensitive information with a civilian .
especially one who enjoys the public spotlight so much .
always a pleasure to see you too , general .
what can i do for you .
as you may know , thereve been unusual occurrences .
officially , weve downplayed their significance , but were concerned .
these anomalies might pose a credible threat to our national security .
these were taken by one of our spy satellites three days ago .
im afraid ive never seen anything like it . ben .
i would say that it was a meteor , but the trails all wrong .
its giving off its own energy .
take a look at this .
these have been appearing in remote areas throughout the world .
field personnel estimate its diameter to be 200 meters .
a sensor could be tied into the baxter buildings satellite grid .
we can pinpoint the location of the object .
good . youll build the sensor for us im afraid i cant .
im getting married this saturday . i just dont have the time .
richards , your country needs your help .
call professor jeff wagner .
hes head of the physics department at brown .
i expected more , richards .
even from you .
john storm , fantastic four lncorporated .
ever done any modeling not interested .
you got an amazing complexion . not interested .
i was definitely still talking .
i cant believe you just turned down a science project .
they can build a sensor without me .
the most important thing right now is our wedding .
no postponements . no interruptions .
and , look , about what you saw back at the bar .
dont worry about it . i know you .
im glad you had fun .
besides .
it was nothing compared to what i did at my bachelorette party .
talk about wild .
hey , what are you doing up here .
nothing . just needed some air .
youre making that thing for the general , arent you .
im guessing susie doesnt know anything about it .
dont worry , my lips are sealed .
that is , they would be if i had any .
look , dont tell johnny .
dont tell johnny what great .
are you building that thing no .
if sue finds out , youll get an invisible kick in the nuts .
hey , hey . were keeping this quiet . i know .
its the wedding of the century . reed richards and susan storm .
mr . fantastic and the invisible woman .
will try again to tie the knot today in a ceremony in new york .

does that amaze anyone else how did she know it was me .
to be honest , you kind of smell like ash .
youre late . lets not make today about me .
its reed and sues big day .
lets give them the attention for a change .
dont do that .
okay , youre perfect . youre perfect .
ill see you upstairs .

randomly affecting matter . evidently , this entity , this .
silver surfer .

lt knew it was being monitored and traced it back here .
were dealing with something highly resourceful .

all of sues results are normal .

turned invisible and is staying that way .
after yesterdays embarrassing fiasco .
next , the invisible woman s greatest fashion blunders .
and an impromptu dance routine from former scientist reed richards .
i cant ignore it , reed . theres no getting away from it .
i believe there is . how .
what if , after this crisis is over .
what if , after this crisis is over .
we move out of the baxter building .
get back to my research .
the two of us will live our lives and raise a family , like normal people .
you would do that .
nothing is more important to me than our future together .
oh , thank you .
theyll understand .
besides , johnnys always been more of a solo act .
lets not mention it to them yet .
johnnys got enough to worry about as it is , with his power problems .
your talents are impressive .
anything would be ours for the taking .
all that you know is at an end .
wait i said , wait .
wait i said , wait .
theyre breaking up the team . reed and sue , i overheard them .
theyre breaking up the team . reed and sue , i overheard them .
no more fantastic four . well .
no more fantastic four . well .
what do we do keep going , just the two of us .
and call ourselves what the dynamic duo .
when were they gonna tell us .
you cant be mad at them for doing what makes them happy .
guys .
guys .
i crossreferenced the surfers radiation through every astronomical database .
altair 7 , rigel 3 , vega 6 .
hes been to all these planets and now theyre lifeless .
barren . some even shattered .
everywhere the surfer goes , eight days later , the planet dies .
we dont even know where he is .
what about the craters .
the last crater was formed in greenland .
latitude 51 degrees , 30 minutes north .
iongitude zero degrees , seven minutes west .
when he surfaces , move the fight away from the crowd .
hes too fast to contain . when i see silver , im hitting him .
you cant do that . we stick to the plan and work as a team .
oh , were a team now news to me .
what are you talking about you know what .
we were gonna tell you .
when when you moved our stuff out johnny , this isnt a good time .
kids got a point , reed . you should have told us .
thats enough well talk about this later .
what the hell is wrong with you people .
dont let go .
guys what are you doing .
ben lift it higher .
stay back , before you get somebody killed .
what the hell was that .
well make adjustments . next time , well be ready .
you cant handle this alone . im bringing in help .
bringing in soldiers and weaponry will put innocent people in danger .
no more than you already have .
victor .
whats the matter afraid of ghosts .
look out dont move .
since youre a ghost , you wont mind if i break your neck .
let him go . you know who that is .
victor von doom . hes here under my orders .
ben , let him go .
how is this possible .
how are you still alive .
no thanks to you four , thats for certain .
von dooms made contact with the alien . hes got valuable information .
information that might just help save the planet .
now lets be clear about this .
shall we i hate you .
all of you .
but the worlds at stake and we need to work together to survive .
general , we know firsthand , you trust victor and youre gonna regret it .
so far , the only one ive regretted trusting here is you , richards .
reed , dont agree to this .
lets see what hes got .
i made a detailed recording of our little encounter .
i like the part where he knocks you on your ass .
look at where the energy levels surge when he attacks me .
there see what happened .
the energy was channeled through him , but it originated from his board .
if we can separate him from the board , we can cut off his power completely .
thats what we have to do . how .
if i knew that , i wouldnt need you people , would l .
you two should get started right away .
im glad we have the opportunity to collaborate again .
ill try to talk slowly so you can keep up .
how can we be working on the same side as victor .
you got me . things were simpler when i could just whale on the guy .
ill pay for that .
ill tell you , ben , im starting to feel like a complete screwup .
hey , hey , youre not a complete screwup .
look , kid , its out of our hands . its up to the eggheads now .
you think reeds right about the whole endoftheworld thing .
hes never been wrong about this kind of thing before .
you know , im not exactly a deep kind of guy .
but if reeds right , and this is it .
how do you want to spend your last few minutes .
part of me would like to go out fighting .
but the truth is .
id like to spend my last couple of minutes holding alicia .
that sounds pretty good .
even with the i cant think of a guy that wouldnt want to .
even with the i cant think of a guy that wouldnt want to .
what i meant .
was that its nice to have somebody .
well , you got me , pal .
hows it going .
i cant find a link .
ltll be all right . no , it wont .
the whole worlds counting on me , and i just .
reed , youre gonna find the answer .
you just need to relax . yeah , right .
you do . reed , you need to relax .
take a deep breath .
slower .
there you go .
come on . again .
see i can already feel your pulse slowing down .
a tachyon pulse .
im glad i could help .
when we activate the field , itll separate him from his board .
making him powerless . like a fish in a net .
ln theory , anyway . how long until its operational .
ln theory , anyway . how long until its operational .
three hours . three hours .
i can only go so fast , since im working by myself .
what do you need to make this happen there are a couple of things .
do your field engineers have a beryllium casing .
what are you doing .
dont you knock youre supposed to be helping reed .
tell him not to worry .
anything else howd you do it .
anything else howd you do it .
the things i can do .
and expand it until they explode .
give it your best shot .
just get back to the lab .
were you waiting outside the bathroom to try and catch me in a towel .
okay , so you do know me .
ive been a little off my game lately .
this is not a game .
sir , hes in position north of here . good .
general , give us a onemile perimeter . forget it , richards .
you dont understand . no , you dont understand .
so let me make it clear for you and your pack of freaks .
im the quarterback . youre on my team .
i stayed in and studied , like a good little nerd .
and fifteen years later .
and the jock who played quarterback in high school .
i am so hot for you right now .
me too .
this is it .
you have your coordinates . set up your posts and rendezvous back here .
hey . you scared me there , smokey . look at you . youre cute .
whats our status yeah . im good to go .
same here . almost there .
guys .
guys .
we have a problem . whats wrong .
get out of there , right now .
why are you destroying our planet .
i have no choice .
theres always a choice .
not always .
i am not the destroyer .
come on , richards . jam the damn signal .
maybe he needs a little persuasion .
fire one over the top . roger , out .
open fire . open fire .
fall back fall back .
let me just no , wait .
come on , sue .
all right , its up .
reed .
youre the quarterback .

where is he contained .
general .
mr . sherman .
if youll excuse us , we have work to do .
i want to be there for the questioning . not gonna happen .
make sure our guests remain here , comfortably .
yes , sir .
general , what about the board .
its in a chamber which continuously scrambles the signal .
there are certain things im not permitted to do .
fortunately , youre not human .
are we prisoners .
how did that happen .
apparently , they dont want us interfering with their methods .
i cant imagine what theyre doing to him .
i say he gets what he deserves . how can you say that .
im just saying maybe the generals right about this .
im just saying maybe the generals right about this .
the guy was about to destroy the planet . he said so himself .
it doesnt make sense . he protected me from the missile . why would he do that .
maybe he thinks youre cute .
theres more going on . he said he wasnt the destroyer .
maybe he lied .
we need to get inside there and talk to him .
but under the radar .
or popcorn or something .
ill call it in . great .
thank you . semper fi .
thats the marine corps . were the army .
right , i know its the army .
captain raye . access granted .
general .
you should really be a little more cooperative .
i know you are there .
come on , you must have a name .
im susan .
you said you werent the one trying to destroy our world . then who is .
the one i serve . who do you serve .
im trying to help you , but to do that , you have to tell me the truth .
it is known by many names . my people called it .
galactus .
the devourer of worlds .
it must feed on energy to survive .
both thermal .
and organic .
how can you serve this thing .
doesnt it bother you , all the worlds and innocent people youve helped destroy .
my service spares my world .
and the one i love .
why did you try to protect me .
because .
you remind me of her .
could you stop the destroyer if you wanted to .
it is not i who draws the destroyer here . it is the beacon .
whats the beacon .
your board .
take joy in the last few hours you have left .
for he is nearly here .
now its time to keep your end of the bargain .
you can do your tests on the board .
but under armed guard and in my presence only .
absolutely .
general hager . access granted .
the board draws it here .
how do you fight something that eats planets .
we have to get to the board and lead it away from here .
well , do you think the general will go for that .
hell have no choice .
thank you , general .
but im afraid .
the truth is .
sometimes reed is right .
hey , you . come here .
let me ask you something .
nice .
crap .
okay , that one hurt .
wheres reed back here .
my bad .
victor . weve gotta get it back .
we need to get the surfer . he understands its power .
even if we break him out of this place , how are we gonna catch up to victor .
leave that to me .
halt stay where you are .
pal , this is the luckiest day of your life .
what the hell is going on where is general hager .
and if we dont get him out of here , well all be .
frankie .
the world is literally at stake here . you have to trust us .
we need to get to the roof . it should be here by now .
what should be here .
this is by far the coolest thing you have ever done .

i can fly circles around you . guys .
reed . shut up and move it .

hang on .
norrin radd .
what i was once called norrin radd .
norrin , well need your help to save our world .

victor , the board is drawing the destroyer here . you have to give it up .
you know , ive never been the giving type , reed .
hold on .

what this ought to be fun .
hes really pissing me off .
surfs up , metalhead .
victor , only the surfer can stop the destroyer . but he needs his board .
come and get it , richards . victor .
lets all go for a spin .
norrin .
catch .
oh , god . johnny , dont touch her .
you need to find a way to get the board .
sue , l . okay .
he is here .
victors gotta have a pulse emitter linking him to his board .
we take it out , we can separate him from his board .
hes too strong for me .
it would take all of us .
or maybe just one of us .
we dont know what it could do to you .
lets not make this about me .
to quote a friend of mine .
its clobbering time .
you aint going down fighting , kid .
not without me .
youve gotta go .
treasure each moment with her .
and tell her she was right .
we do have a choice .
thought you could use a hand .
why isnt it working .
we were too late .
i will no longer serve .
this is the end for us both .
what did i miss .
he did it . great job , kid .
hey , wait . im not changing .
hey , thats right .
okay , now youre making me uncomfortable .
we all go our separate ways .

then perhaps i should .
will shaun be gone long hell be back soon .

a man whose idea of a romantic nightspot is also an impenetrable fortress .

lets just wait for shaun . well barricade the window when he gets back .
what then how long days weeks a month .
what are we going to eat toasties .
theres a breville out back . great . saved by nibbles .
must be why shaun took us here before he left .
hes coming back why because he promised .

to have a top band with us , talking about their work for the charity zombaid .
the fact that the mobile deceased retained their primal instincts .
make them ideal recruitment for the service industry , .

a man , who fearing for his life .
agreed to cooperate and tell all he knew about the inner workings of this mob .
this group of leeches that suck money .
out of every enterprise , legitimate or illegitimate .
to support their extravagant lifestyles .
now , we will be asking you .
to examine an awesome amount of evidence .

but the severity of these crimes .
against the people of this community .
in fact , all america .
make it necessary for you to do just that .
we will now hear opening statements from defense counsels .
mr . cellano represents , uh , defendant dominic crespi .
the governments tapes , you will conclude .
that my client is not guilty of anything more than .
since when is it a crime to wear fancy clothes .
and an expensive diamond pinky ring and drive a cadillac .
if you arrested everyone who ever made a friendly wager on a sporting event .
youd have to lock up half of the people in this courtroom .
youre up soon . you ready man and all of this in 40 years of driving .
i got nothing written down .
well , what are you gonna say then .
how the fuck do i know this whole case is a joke , right .
mr . klandis is representing defendant carlo mascarpone .
right in front of you , ladies and gentlemen .
is this latin motto , whose translation is: .
let justice be done , though the heavens may fall .
i have the fate of carlo mascarpone in my hands .
there he is sitting near his brother gino .
they didntjoin the lucchese family , because they already had one .
the family created by mr . and mrs . mascarpone .
its called biology .
youll hear a lot about my clients flamboyant lifestyle .
his wife , rosalynd , sits in this courtroom .
married 17 years , four children .
thats a lifestyle .
he goes to st . lucys church . his wife teaches c.c.d .
many of these defendants are related , some are friends or neighbors .
that have known each other since playing little league baseball together .
they are a family .
not the kind of family the government talks about .
they would twist it . they would make it evil .
but all were asking for , ladies and gentlemen .
is to let justice be done , though the heavens may fall .
thank you .
okay . lets see whos next .
mr . dinorscio . mr . dinorscio .
isnt your attorney here .
well , your honor , i think imim better off .
uh , l i wanna go pro se . im gonna be my own lawyer .
do you know what pro se means .
sort of . what do you mean , sort of .
uh , if you defend yourself , its called pro se . im gonna defend myself .
mr . dinorscio , in a case of this magnitude , i dont think its advisable .
my sixth amendment right .
i mean , i got the right to defend myself . am i correct , judge .
yes . yeah , youre correct . have you had any legal experience .
uh , well , sort of .
what do you mean , sort of .
ive been in prison half my life .
sometimes i think i had too much legal experience .
mr . dinorscio , have you heard the saying .
that a man who represents himself has a fool for a client .
now i have . is it true , judge .
sometimes it is .
so that means sometimes it aint , right .
thank you , judge . but i dont think its advisable . its up to you .
uh , mr . dinorscio , youre on .
hi , im jackie dinorscio .
uh , im defending myself in this case .
youll have to excuse me , im a little nervous .
you see , im no lawyer .
i only have a sixthgrade education .
and , uh , im not sophisticated in the law like some of these other persons here .
but what i tell you will come from the heart .
four months ago .
we started to pick jurors for this trial .
and i wanna say right now .
that im satisfied with everybody on the jury .
and i wanna thank mr . klandis .
for translating that latin slogan in front of the judge .
i thought it meant no smoking .
i was literally about to light up .
like i said , uh .
im no lawyer .
uh , so i dont know where they came up with this rico law thing .
should probably ask mr . kierney . i guess if youre italian , you should be in prison .
ive read the rico act , and i can tell you its more appropriate .
for some of those guys over in washington than it is for me or any of my fellas here .
are you through , mr . dinorscio uh , no , judge .
how do i look , good chuckling .
you see this hat .
im wearing this hat to make me look like a gangster .
cause thats what that table wants me to be .
a gangster .
but im not a gangster , ladies and gentlemen .
im a gagster . this aint even my hat .
thank you , mr . washington .
now , im sure mr . kierney .
will tell you ive been in jail half my life , most of my life .
id rather go to jail for a thousand years .
than to ever rat on any of my friends .
do you know that this government .
this government offered me a deal .
to join their list of witnesses .
and lie about these men here objection .
sustained . mr . dinorscio .
what you will confine the opening statement .
but l to the evidence to be presented .
thank you , judge . i got it . okay .
the evidence will show that they wanted me to lie about my friends .
objection . overruled . and i just could never do that .
i grew up with these guys . how long i known you guys .
ive known them since we were little babies .
i love these guys . theyre all i got .
but now all the prosecutors got .
is a nutcase , two junkies and a bank robber .
objection . sustained . mr . dinorscio .
i got this , judge . chuckling .
they talk about us being extravagant . you hear him before .
to support their extravagant lifestyles .
do i look extravagant .
one day , my wife asked me for $20 to buy a rump roast from the butcher .
i told her , $20 for a rump roast .
of which i took her to the kitchen where we got a fulllength mirror .
i pull out a $20 bill out of my pocket . i hold it up to the mirror .
i say , sweetheart , you see that $20 bill in the mirror .
that one belongs to you . this one belongs to me .
and im out of there . its over .
the next day , ladies and gentlemen , i come home .
and i see roasted meats from one end of the table to the other .
and i asked her , i said , honey , whered all the meat come from .
so she took me back over to the fulllength mirror .
she lifts up her dress , ladies and gentlemen .
she points to the mirror and she says .
the one in the mirror is yours , honey .
this one belongs to the butcher .
gavel raps i mean , extravagant do i look extravagant .
finestein mr . dinorscio . i woulda wore a better suit .
finestein mr . dinorscio .
hey , all right . everybody , please quiet down .
please , youll all get a chchance to talk .
max , how do you think it went .
well , i havent had a chance to talk to nick yet , but all in all , not a bad day .
ben , i thought you were terrific .
chris , frank , henry , all of you , good work .
then that fuckin lunatic gets up there , and i dont know what to think anymore .
i dont know if its good or bad . bad . all bad .
we got a major rico trial going on here .
and all of a sudden we gotta contend with fuckin shecky green .
ben , the guys a time bomb out there .
you know the clich� , never ask a question you dont know the answer to .
hes gonna ask a question , or hes gonna say something .
or something is gonna pop out of that shithole of a mouth that hes got .
and were gonna get hurt .
well , see , you know , im not sure i agree .
i was stealing looks at the jury .
they were with him . they were laughing with him .
so let me throw that other clich� out at you .
a laughing jury is never a hanging jury .
lets sleep on this .
wait it out a couple of days , see how it develops .
i can always rein him in later .
nobody can take him seriously . hes a clown up there .
jokes about his wifes twat . are you kidding me i agree .
lin a week , theyll see him and the rest of them for the morons they are .
i dont want em to see those guys as morons .
i want that jury to see pimps , liars , racketeers , arsonists and murderers .
its an old saying , but i believe it .
a laughing jury aint a hanging jury .
and he had em laughing . i dont agree at all , sean .
laughing at him can indicate disrespect as well .
i dont know if you noticed , but a couple of the women in the jury looked deeply offended .
hell step over the line . youll see . its an act .
no , its not an act . thats what makes him dangerous . hes like some 60s pop tune .
all you need is love . fuck .
like some deepak chopra with a pinky ring .
see you , nick . see you guys .
good night , nicky .
counselor .
youre dead wrong , counselor .
youll never rein him in .
hes fuckin crazy . ive known him a long time .
hes out for number one . hell have that jury laughin , and hell get off .
and well be standin there with our dicks in our hand .
nick , see now , now , listen to me .
this is my fuckin life on the line .
i gotta be sure . it looks to me like hes hurting us .
im separating him from the case . itslts not up to you .
you wanna bet dont get stupid on me , nick .
im a lot of things . stupid aint one of them .
have a good day , counselor .
hey , mickey . aw .

yes , sir . i got busted . and i was facing 40 years , so i flipped .
regarding your narcotics sales .
you split the proceeds from those transactions with mr . dinorscio .
thats right . and how was nick calabrese involved .
i heard i heard he always got his cut .
objection . hearsay . finestein sustained .
just your personal experience , mr . juarez .
did you ever meet mr . calabrese in person once .
i was at a birthday party forjackies daughter , and he was there .
jackie told me who nick really was .
why would mr . dinorscio confide in you .
jackie and me , we used to party together a lot .
we were doing coke . wed get high and .
when we had broads , jackie liked to nail em two at a time .
thank you , mr . juarez .
finestein mr . dinorscio . you know , not for nothing , judge .
but i thought this was the rico act , not the puerto rico act .
jackie how you doing , pal .

diego says , you only got six shots in that thing .
and there is seven of us . and .
chuckles ill never forget it .
you said , how about if i shoot the six of you .
and strangle the seventh motherfucker .
and we walk out , right with the money and the coke .
now , octavio , have you ever i dont think anyone has .
have you ever heard me try to deny me using cocaine no way .
no , of course not . i wouldnt deny using cocaine ever .
i loved it . in fact , did you bring any .
what did he say i didnt hear the punch line .
the main point was to tie calabrese tojackie . we got that .
and , peter , call manhattan correctional .
fuckinjackies got himself set up like he was at a hotel . okay .
tell em i dont want him too comfortable . got it .
man hey , jackie . how was court today , man .

mr . bellman , how did you come to know mr . dinorscio .
uh , when i got paroled , i had no job , no money , nothing .
and a friend of mine hooked me up with jackie .
i lived with him in florida for a while .
and what was your relationship with him .
i was a gofer . i , uh , i drove him around , picked up guns for him .
and i gave rides to his friends , and , uh , i brought messages back and forth .
from him and some of these defendants here .
and did you ever see any drug transactions take place .
i was there when they were cuttin up the money .
and to the best of your knowledge , how was that money distributed .
uh , me and jackie got a share .
jimmy thejew got his .
i mean , uh , jimmy katz .
and , uh , of course the boss , nick calabrese , got the big cut .
did you witness this .
jackie and jimmy , yes .
not nick . move to strike as hearsay .
sustained . strike the reference to mr . calabrese .
and when did your relationship with mr . dinorscio end .
well , you see , jackie started gettin nutty from all the coke .
one christmas , he wanted me to get chickens to cook for a party .
i got tired of runnin errands for him .
when i didnt get the chickens , he threw me out of the house .
thats the last i saw of him .
thank you , mr . bellman . your witness .
now , tell the truth , harry .
isnt the real reason i threw you out of that house .
cause i refused sexual advances from you to me .
what objection sustained .
now , harry , isnt it true that the guys in jail used to call you mary .
objection . no , thats not true .
sustained . mr . dinorscio .
i warned you .
harry , when you got out of prison .
isnt it true you didnt have a dime to your name .
didnt i take you in didnt i treat you good .
and this is how you pay me back , by rattin you treated me like dirt .
you come here and you say that i committed these crimes after i treated you like a brother .
didnt i feed you yeah , i feed my dogs too .
look , harry , how could this jury be sure youre telling the truth about me breaking the law .
when half the time you were high from shootin drugs .
objection . thats a lie .

i will , judge .
come on , harry . roll up your sleeve .
show the needle marks to thejury .
hey , stay away from me . stay a come on , harry .

that christmas .
wasnt the real reason i threw you out of that house .
cause i woke up one morning and caught you tryin to give me a blow job .
im not kidding you .
i see the way you look at me . i know whats on your mind .
you wanna suck on this instead for a while .
mr . dinorscio should be held in contempt of court .
remove the jury laughter .

jackie , jackie . what a fuckinjob youre doin , man .
youre wearing em out . keep it up . love you , baby . all right .
ben . ben .

i dont think so .
why what the hell did i do .
two ladies on the jury were looking at you as if they wouldnt pick you up with tongs .
i cant let my client be affected by your behavior .
you damn well better control yourself or youre on your own .
okay , okay , i got it .
can you help me out , ben .
i wanna have lunch with the fellas .
every day my marshals take me down to the holding cell .
technically , youre still a prisoner , jackie .
you think i dont know that .
ben , ben . i asked them this morning if i could have lunch with the fellas .
i grew up with most of them . by now theyre family .
if its okay with your marshals , its okay with me .
hey man hey , jackie .
you guys save any for me huh .
all chattering , indistinct hiya , nick .
what are you doing here you eat downstairs in the holding cell .
no , my marshal said it was okay if i ate with you guys .
nobody cleared it with me .
i didnt know it had to be cleared with you , nick . now you know .
you know , nick , i dont know why youre giving me such a hard time .
i love these guys . stop with the love shit , jackie .
youre so full of shit . what , because were from the same neighborhood .
i didnt trust you when you was a kid . i dont trust you now .
what the fuck are you talkin about you got no reason to say that .
i got no reason i got no fuckin reason .
i see you up there kissin ass so you can walk .
youll suck cock to walk . youre the faggot , not bellman .
now , why dont you get the fuck out of here .
what , do i stutter .
coffee , sir salami on ham .
agent kerry .
you conducted many hours of surveillance .
on each one of these defendants .
on trial here today , correct i did .
that an organized crime family existed in northern new jersey .
under the leadership of nick calabrese yes , that is correct .
and how did you determine that calabrese was the boss .
well , i was in a restaurant in bloomfield on .
september 19 of last year .
it had a reputation as being a mob hangout .
why did it have that reputation .
jackie because the food was good .
no interruptions .
thank you , your honor . go on , sir .
i was at the bar . uh , you could see a large , private dining room at the back .
the doors were open , and two very .
well , heavyset gentlemen in tuxedoes stood by the door .
in the dining room , you could see a birthday party was going on .
how did you know it was a birthday party .
they were all wearing paper hats and they had those things that when you blow on them .
they uncurl and go hums .
these were children no , sir .
no , sir . these were grown men .
go on . well , at the head of a horseshoe table .
sat , uh , mr . calabrese .
and as i observed , all these italian males lined up to kiss his ring .
chuckles it was obvious to me that they were paying respects .
to mr . calabrese as being the boss .
it was like out of the movies . there was no other conclusion .
thank you , agent kerry .
mr . klandis no questions , your honor .
mr . novardis coughing .
i have nothing for this witness , your honor .
there are no further questions . id like to ask him something .
mr . dinorscio . thank you , your honor .
mr . kerry , i was wondering about something .
could you tell all of us how you knew that those men in that restaurant was italian .
well , it uh .
lyou know , i guess that .
hey , they all looked italian to me .
wow . you know .
with the hand gestures and the back slapping and the kissing and everything .
no . no , thats not part of our training . no .
you speak italian no .
could you hear them talking in italian .
no , i was too far away .
see , iim not understanding this .
youre saying from the back slapping and the kissing , you knew that they were italian .
well , it was an italian restaurant . did they all have black hair .
uh , yeah , yeah . from what i can remember , yeah .
could they have been spanish , greek , jewish .
not with nick calabrese at the head of the table , no .
you saying nick only eats with italians .
no , im not saying that .
what if i told you i went into a restaurant .
and there was nothing but irish guys there .
and you says , howd you know they were irish .
and i says , cause they were all drunk , vomiting all over the floor .
kierney objection , your honor . badgering the witness .
mr . dinorscio . no , its all right , judge .
look , mr . dinorscio . if it walks like a duck , looks like a duck .
quacks like a duck , chances are its a duck .
if it talks like an asshole , looks likes an asshole .
chances are its an asshole .
gavel rapping objection . this behavior cannot be tolerated .
mr . dinorscio , i am fining you $5,000 for contempt of court .
thats what i got , your honor . i got contempt for this court .
you shouldve stopped him before with all the italian shit .
you are now fined 10,000 .
wanna try for 15 .
if there are no further questions , i want to warn the defendants right now .
that if they keep up this raucous behavior .
they will be liable for contempt charges with heavy fines .
and you defense attorneys will be liable to contempt as well .
for not keeping your clients under control .
sidebar , my chambers .
jackie . jackie .
jerkoff , dont say my name ever again .
you say my name again , ill cut your fuckin heart out .
ive done it before . id be thrilled to do it again .
jackie , what .
what the fuck do you think youre doing up there .
what i speak my mind .
you can kick his dog , you can spit in his face .
but the one thing a judge never wants to hear is criticism about his court .
fuck him . he aint the jury . what the fuck could he do .
jackie , your ignorance is second only to your arrogance .
mr . klandis , how do you think mr . dinorscios behavior .
is affecting the jurys relationship to your client and the other defendants .
your honor dont say a word , mr . dinorscio .
not a word . mr . klandis .
hes clearly a disruptive force .
finestein mr . kierney . he undermines the authority of your court .
and if i may say so , youd never permit such behavior from a regular attorney .
sighs see any solution .
if he were just the defendant , you could put him in another room . they both watch it on tv .
unfortunately , it seems to me theres no choice .
he has to be severed from this trial and tried separately .
finestein mr . klandis .
its extreme , but im not against it .
finestein i have no idea what the legal consequences would be .
ill put my clerk to work on it .
all right , we ready for the jury .
judge .
yes , mr . dinorscio .
can i talk to you .
i wanna apologize for my action in court before .
i want you to understand .
whatever i said , i meant no disrespect to you .
i respect you more than any other judge i ever faced , and i faced a lot of them .
okay , well , thank you , mr . dinorscio .
i was out of line before .
i agree i should be held in contempt .
kissing sounds finestein all right . bring in thejury .
jurors , jurors , will you please take your seats as quickly as possible .
whats going on you all right groaning .
i need an opening . break this up , here . come on . e.m.t .
there you go . there you go . okay .
chattering man i need some room .
i need some room , guys . please , give me some room .
can you breathe .
watch his head . watch his head .
bring him all the way up , all the way up . is he in trouble .
youre gonna be all right , tommy . dont worry .
the paramedics are gonna take care of you . whispers , indistinct .
nappy , want me to call your mother .
nappy . all right . nappy .
there , uh , wont be any test results before friday , maybe even monday .
so lets adjourn until we get .
your honor , this trial is over 11 months old .
we havent even reached the halfway mark in our presentation .
mr . kierney , im not used to being interrupted .
you are the one who handed in a witness list of more than 89 people .
and you have already introduced more than 450 exhibits .
and i am told there are hundreds more coming .
so let us not complain about a lengthy trial .
a defendant is sick and he is gonna get a fair shake in my courtroom , understood .
the clerk will notify you about our next meeting . have a good night , gentlemen .
nappy napoli . how do you like that .
boy , oh , boy , time is fleeting . time is what .
fleeting . time is fleeting .
what the hell does that mean , time is fleeting whats fleeting .
fleeting . its like fleeing . time is fleeing .
but its in the past tense , so they say fleeting .
youre full of shit .
youre an ignorant slob .
you look good .
you got everything you need youre okay on money .
yeah . stop worrying about me , pop . im fine .
hows your brother doing .
good , i guess . i mean , you know , i dont really see him too much .
i worry about him . you worry about everything .
only family . thats all that matters .
the rest of its a fart in a hurricane . chuckling .
hows your mama doing she looks good . i see her all the time .
yeah yeah .
say hello for me .
i dont know , pop . i mean , the last time i did that she kind of gave me that look .
like i should never say it again .
shes tough . boy , is she tough .
you know what the two best words in the english language are .
things change .
okay . first , about mr . dinorscio .
because hes both a defendant and an attorney .
i think separating him out at this point .
will make an appeal by the losing side almost inevitable .
anyone wanna go through this again .
no . so he stays .
but i promise you this , mr . dinorscio .
if you are as disruptive as you have been in the past .
you are out like that . snaps fingers .
and to hell with what happens later .
you got me .
second , trial resumes on monday . ive spoken with the doctors .
they feel mr . napoli is fully capable of understanding the proceedings around him .
your honor , he cant even sit up .
arrange for his hospital bed to be brought into the courtroom .
your honor , hes under heavy medication .
the doctors are cutting it way back this weekend .
he falls asleep when i talk to him . make yourself more interesting .
now , look , goddamn it . were a year in .
this trial is going forward . monday , 10:00 a.m .
hey , theres tommy napoli .
im glad to see youse guys . look at these shoes .
nappy napoli cant rise . is it all right if he stays layin down .
be seated .
you can see their autos parked here near the entrance .
there are two lincolns .
and one , two , three cadillacs .
as well as other vehicles parked nearby .
we continued our surveillance until mr . mascarpone and mr . roma .
got in their cars and left .
nine hours later at 4:00 a.m .
agent petraki , when you arrested my client , carlo mascarpone .
did he resist in any way no .
i had a very pleasant conversation with mr . mascarpone .
and what did you talk about .
we discussed political philosophy and history .
i found out that he was a great admirer of machiavelli .
so you discussed machiavelli . no discussions of shakedowns , payoffs or rubouts , correct .
thats correct . but since i once taught a class in political philosophy .
i thought it ironic that carlo mascarpone was an admirer of machiavelli .
whose major theme was that power corrupts .
and absolute power corrupts absolutely .
i felt that perhaps mr . mascarpone applied machiavellis ideas .
to his own line of work as a mob boss .
your honor , my next line of questioning could take some time .
its so close to lunch , would anybody object if we took an hour now .
any objections .
one hour .
do you see this book .
its called bartletts familiar quotations .
do you know who lord acton was .
lord acton acton , acton .
no , sir . well , he was english .
he lived from 1834 to 1902 .
thats 300 years after machiavelli .
and its right here on page 39 , it says .
lord acton is the author of the quote .
power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely . .
not machiavelli . murmuring .
no further questions , your honor .
mr . petraki , you was a college teacher yes .
now , in those courses that you taught .
in what was it , politics .
machiavellis a big deal , am i right a very big deal .
i mean , were not talking about a made guy in the lucchese family .
so , my question is .
how could you make a mistake like that .
i mean , youre this educated guy , right .
and a lot of us , most of us , didnt even get through high school .
except maybe carlo .
so your testifying here can hurt us .
do you see what im saying it was just an honest mistake .
what else was an honest mistake .
you said earlier that it was a lincoln .
you said they spent nine hours .
could that be a caddy could that be a mercury .
could that be a buick .
you said they spent nine hours . maybe they spent three .
maybe you dont know what the hell youre talking about , mr . petraki .
i prepared him , sean . its my fuckup . i feel like hell .
dont worry about it . we got compagna coming up . hes our clincher .
heres what happens when jackie crossexamines him . its guinea versus guinea .
in 30 seconds , jackie dee will be screaming at him . i guarantee it .
and i make my motion to separate that fuck .
finestein has to grant it . hes committed .
ladies . gentlemen . female reporter is this a bad day .
hiya , pop . how you doing .
well , im doing okay . hows mom doin .
oh , some days good , some bad , you know .
not to worry , all right not to worry .
i mean .
its almost two years since ive seen her , pop .
i mean , you think shes ever gonna come visit me in court .
scoffs i wouldnt count on it .
listen , jackie .
im sorry , you know . ii never wanted this for you .
if it was good enough for you , it was good enough for me .
youre doing great .
did you see me did i see you every day .
did you see the people laughing youre terrific .
i really mean it . you know , you could be a tv show .
three of the jurors almost fell out of their chairs .
i know it . i know . youre fantastic .
mr . mcqueen , please state your occupation .
undercover agent for the f.b.i . and your assignment .
my job was to penetrate the mascarpone crew .
under the alias name carl cassio .
to determine the extent of organized crime control of the new jersey seaports .
and how long were you undercover .
for over two years , i was accepted as one of the boys .
and during those two years , what type of criminal activities did you observe .
i saw scams , heard discussions about everything .
from stolen cars , stolen bonds , to bootlegged cigarettes .
there were deals going on all the time .
hundreds of thousands of dollars were involved .
and how was mr . calabrese involved .
we all knew a piece of everything we got went to nick .
novardis your honor , objection . objection .
my client is being pilloried no , crucified .
by nothing but hearsay , hearsay , hearsay .
if mr . novardis will stop repeating himself hearsay , hearsay .
oh , please . well get beyond hearsay .
gavel raps go on , mr . kierney .
but you better connect the dots , or ill strike the question and the answer .
mr . mcqueen , how did you know .
that mr . calabrese got a piece of everything off the top .
jackie dinorscio had introduced me to his cousin , tony compagna .
compagna had real troubles cocaine , booze .
talked too much , he earned too little .
i was with him one day when he delivered over $7,000 to mr . calabrese in a paper bag .
and how did you know the amount .
he asked me to count it for him , cause he said he was too stoned .
and then what happened .
we went to a restaurant called .
the hole in the wall .
mr . calabrese was there with the mascarpone brothers and somebody i didnt know .
he went up to mr . calabrese and said , here you are , boss , on account .
and left the bag on the table .
what happened then calabrese took the money .
opened it , counted it .
and then he said to tony .
what the hell kind of bag is this the moneys all greasy .
and tony says , im sorry . i ordered some egg rolls .
they was kinda greasy . it was the only bag i got .
and mr . calabrese says , you cocksucker .
you give me greasy money again , youll owe me twice as much .
now get the fuck outta here .
and he starts to laugh . and then everyone starts to laugh .
mr . calabrese blows the bag up , pops it .
tony makes believe he got shot , slides under the table .
so , by now , everyones laughing so hard , theyre crying .
but mr . calabrese shortpocketed the money .
thank you . thank you , mr . mcqueen .
novardis would you read that back , please .
he went up to mr . calabrese and he said , here you are , boss , on account . .
on account . isnt it possible .
that mr . compagna owed mr . calabrese money .
and was simply repaying him .
i have no idea . you didnt answer the question .
isnt it possible that mr . compagna .
owed mr . calabrese that money , yes or no .
okay , yes .

so , why this meeting , sean .
your honor , ben .
obviously after 19 months , i feel weve made a good case .
and after compagna testifies next week , i think were home .
despite that , i wanna offer a deal .
not because i think were weak , i dont .
but we never know what a jury will do .
my heart and soul are in this case .
i dont wanna risk one of these guys walkin .
id rather offer less of a sentence now than risk any of them walking .
im im listening .
okay , all your guys plead guilty .
twenty for nick and the mascarpone brothers . theyre the ones i really want .
seven and a half to 10 for everybody else , except forjackie .
for him , five to run concurrent with his present sentence .
and a contract for a new latenight show at abc .
laughs thats as funny as the rest of your offer .
ben , are you laughing at him or with him how do you mean .
if youre laughing at him , youre turning him down .
if youre laughing with him , youre negotiating .
let me talk to the guys .
so , thats their proposition .
novardis thats good news youre bringing , ben . how do you mean .
well , you dont get an offer if they think they made their case . its as simple as that .
thats usually the way it works , but we got a big question mark here .
your fucking cousin , jackie , how is he gonna testify .
is he gonna cry is he gonna break their hearts .
it doesnt matter how hell testify . ill destroy him .
like you destroyed mcqueen come on , jackie , everybody .
please , leave your egos out of this .
its a serious offer . go ahead , frank .
there are 20 lawyers in this room with what , over 300 years of experience .
can one of you say he hasnt been stunned .
chuckles stunned hell , knocked cockeyed with surprise .
at a verdict by a jury , raise your hand .
how would you vote , frank .
my client is a sick guy falling out ofbed at his own trial .
seven and a half to 10 . out in four ifhe doesnt get out sooner for medical reasons .
i cant see how we can turn it down . now , hold on , frank .
my client , bens client , theyre facing three times that .
granted . its tougher , but lets be honest .
theyre facing life if they go down .
okay , everybody , well sleep on it .
well meet here tomorrow at 8:00 a.m . , and the defendants will vote .
let me just say one thing .
i think we all need to be unanimous on this .
if some take it , it practically screams the other guys are guilty .
so , united , okay all agreed .
can i say something .
for me , its easy . i still got a long time on my old sentence .
god knows i love you guys . i wouldnt do nothin to hurt youse .
stop with the love shit , jackie . just say your piece .
when i got indicted on this .
geez , what is it , ben , three years ago .
they offered me a deal .
i said no , naturally .
then , while im out on bail on the rico charge .
they pick me up again on the dope charge .
the one im doing time on now .
now , im not a jerkoff . i know what the hell theyre doing .
theyre using the second case so they can pressure me on the first , right .
so now im serving my 30 .
this trial finally gets here .
and they offer me another deal .
this time theyve got shrimp cocktail .
they got steaks . they got wines .
i tell mr . kierney to go fuck yourself .
now , most of you gumps get to go home every night .
you got hot meals waitin for you .
you got some warm pussy waitin for you .
that is , if your wifes out of town .
not me .
i go back to the manhattan correctional every day .
the meals aint that great .
and my only pussy is my right hand .
and im still sayin .
jackie dee dont rat .
jackie dee wont ever rat .
i was raised with a different kind of loyalty . you know what i mean .
i vote no .

i , uh i guess the answer is no .
compagnas phone tapes dont show any calls from jackie .
and the prison phone log doesnt show jackie calling compagna .
sean , youre worrying needlessly .
you know why ive won every case ive been on .
because i worry needlessly .
what if those two guineas have conspired to fuck us on monday .
we cant risk it . do you understand .
sean , weve checked everything .
what about his jail cell .
i want it stripped down . i want every piece of paper that exists .
turn that fuckin place upside down .
if theyve had contact , i have to know it .
thisthis is the whole ball game .

look at his face . whats the judge gonna say .
jackie knows the rules . right , jackie what happened to you .
i fell . see .
my apologies to the court .
i thought everybody loved you , jackie .
finestein mr . kierney .
the prosecution calls anthony compagna to the stand .
bailiff do you solemnly swear to tell the truth .
the whole truth , and nothing but the truth , so help you god .
i do . kierney mr . compagna .
did there come a time when you made contact with the f.b.i .
yes . and at such time .
did you agree to become a cooperating witness .
yeah , i did .
why because i feared for my life .
and why did you fear for your life .
uh , because i shot one of the defendants , jackie dinorscio .
and what is your relationship to mr . dinorscio .
cousin . we grew up together .
and what was it about the shooting that made you fear for your life .
well , cause i missed .
and are you familiar with the defendants gino mascarpone .
and nick calabrese yeah .
yeah , it went like this .
i worked forjackie handling the numbers and drugs .
and jackie reported to gino . and calabrese was boss of it all .
kierney are you familiar with any of the other defendants .
yeah . every one of these guys were in different rackets together .
objection objection finestein overruled .
then , mr . compagna , if you were involved in crimes .
with your cousin and the other defendants .
why did you shootjackie dinorscio .
well , you see , i was in the gem business with jackie .
we used to get suckers to invest in colored gemstones .
and when they went to sell them , they found out they werent worth all that much .
we was doin good . jackie was the closest person in the world to me at that point .
and what changed all that jackie started stealing from the company .
little by little , the business went downhill . finally it went bust .
i was without a job . pretty soon out of money .
uh , jackie had other businesses going . he could have got me work that way .
i turned to him for help . he wont even help me .
he wont even talk to me .
so , one morning , i headed forjackies house .
i was mad atjackie . i was i was desperate .
can you describe what happened next .
i went into his room i wasnt even thinking .
i ran into his room and i shot him .
i was scared . i ran out .
and then what happened .
uh , i was picked up by the cops a couple days later .
when they charged me with attempted murder , thats when i knew jackie was still alive .
i was scared . and then what .
a detective comes in , and he says , okay , you can go .
jackie just signed a statement says you didnt got nothing to do with the shooting .
so thats when i knew . knew what , mr . compagna .
the boys didnt want me in jail at all .
jackie wanted me back out on the street so they could deal with me in their own way .
so thats when i went to the f.b.i . and agreed to cooperate .
thank you , mr . compagna .
your witness .
mr . compagna , isnt it true that you had undergone psychiatric .
and electric shock treatment even before agreeing to cooperate with the government .
yeah , i had some treatment . so what .
and during this period that you allege you observed these men .
involved in racketeering and other crimes .
you were under the influence of heroin .
i took heroin sometimes .
and cocaine .
marijuana quaaludes .
sometimes . and methadone .
shall i take your silence as a yes answer .
ill tell you what well do . ill call them off , and you tell me when im wrong .
valium . dilaudid . doriden . darvocet .
seconal . percodan . percocet . librium .
i was having a tough time then , all right .
i took whatever i could to make it through the day .
mr . dinorscio , you wanna tell me what happened .
i fell .
coz , could you repeat what you told mr . kierney .
when he asked you to describe our relationship .
i said you were the closest person in the world to me .
do you always shoot those that are close to you .
mr . klandis asked you about all those drugs you took .
and i wanna know , are you on any now .
no . the reason im asking .
is i wanna make sure that youre not blocking anything out while your testifying .
no , i aint , i aint . i told everything i know .
then tell me something .
whyd you say i stole from our business .
cause it was obvious that you did .
you know that these prosecutors went to everybody else at that company .
and you were the only one that said that i stole .
oh , ii dont know about that .
youre blockin , tony .
you testified that you were mad at me . why would you be mad at me .
you cause youyou would give money to everybody else .
what did i tell you but not me . you gave money to your friends .
your broads , your dealers , anybody , but not me .
tony , what did i tell you .
i stopped giving you money cause you were using it .
just to go out and buy more drugs , right l .
look at me , tony . sighs .
why arent you lookinat me , tony .
remember when we were kids remember all our lives .
whenever we lied to each other we couldnt face each other .
thats when we knew we were lyin , just like youre doinnow .
questions . just ask questions , mr . dinorscio .
when your mother died , tony .
do you know who paid for her funeral .
the insurance . mmmmm .
i did .
ask your sister . shes sittinright there .
if you did pay for her funeral , thank you .
tell me something .
after you shot me .
did i go runninto the cops .
no , i didnt .
i told you , i feared for my life .
now , tony , isnt it true that once you ran to the government .
you were able to get all the drugs that you wanted .
objection . overruled .
i needed i needed treatment . they were willing to help me .
help you the government didnt help you .
the government gave you anything you wanted as long as you helped them .
put men youve known your whole life in jail .
aint that right .
aint it .
they said if i wanted protection that i had to testify against everybody .
remember that day that you shot me .
there was someone else in that house , wasnt there no .
youre blockinagain , tony .
wasnt my daughter in that house .
not some stranger , but your own blood .
so you were the only one i had anything against .
what did i say to you when you shot me .
i dont remember .
tell em . i told you i dont remember .
you cant say it , can you .
you dont remember me saying , my god .
why are you doing this to me , coz i love you .
you remember that . you just couldnt say it , could you .
remember what you did after i said i loved you .
you shot me three more times .
tony , look at me .
tony .
you hurt me bad .
i thought i was gonna die .
im so im sorry i shot you .
are you sorry you shot me , or are you sorry you didnt kill me .
both .
let me ask you one more question , tony .
do you believe that i still love you .
i cant get next to this guy , judge .
i dont wanna crossexamine him anymore .
i dont wanna talk to him .
any redirect .
no , your honor .
okay , if there are no further questions , thats it for the day .
kierney twentyone months .
sometimes .
sometimes i get up to pee in the wee small hours .
and i cant get back to sleep .
thats never happened to me before .
now well hear the closing arguments . mr . kierney .
i wanna congratulate you on entering the guinness book of world records .
youre part of the longest criminal trial in american history .
im not proud of that .
i know its put enormous strain on all concerned .
but from all these details .
a collective power emerges .
if you walk away with only one impression from these 22 months .
let it be this: .
the men you see before you have engaged in all sorts of criminal activities .
for decades , decades .
with utter disregard for the law .
and they deserve to be punished by society for these crimes .
now the defense will try to distract you from this undeniable fact .
by complaining that the prosecution witnesses are junkies , crooks .
strongarm guys and worse .
well , maybe some of them are . but these defendants .
if they know any honest citizens .
never have any dealings with them .
now , weve had our share of big personalities in this trial .
i ask you not to let personalities play any part here .
but that you focus specifically .
on the overwhelming physical evidence that has been presented .
i thank you for your time .
and i thank you for your patience .
in performing your duty as lawabiding citizens .
even to a point where his health broke down , was there a direct connection .
how many of you could have gone through with this trial .
how many times was he named in this trial .
twice . twice in a year and 10 months .
has my client been in jail yes . but have we reached a point under the rico act .
where we indict a man for past crimes hes already done time for .
i representjimmy katz . youve heard him referred to as jimmy thejew .
how come the government had one defendant whose name did not end in a vowel .
ill tell you how come gino mascarpone is being persecuted .
because his name ends in a vowel .
ladies and gentlemen , the prosecution took great pains .
to point out that my client and his friends .
knew the sordid array of misfits they used as witnesses .
they want you to believe that these men spent their lives .
with the criminal element you saw in this courtroom .
i wanna offer you a different part of carlo mascarpones life .
and im sure the lives of these other defendants as well .
wife , children .
his priest , his m.d .
the guy who pumps his gas and inspects his car for him .
in other words , the hundredodd people .
whose lives he touches every day , every week .
leading a life very much like yours .
the government brought you witnesses .
government informants , who , because of the lives they have led .
have lost the ability to tell the difference between truth and lies .
these highlypaid informants .
came to the government in various ways .
but there is one constant .
they all came in handcuffs .
the government does not like these defendants .
they dont like the neighborhood they come from .
they dont like the way they talk .
they dont like their tradition , their culture .
but we are a nation of laws , not men .
the purpose of the prosecutor , much like the purpose of the grand jury .
is to search for truth .
but somehow in this case that was lost .
the prosecutor became the persecutor .
win at any cost .
i thank you all for your time .
and now i pass my clients fate into your hands .
phone call , jackie .
yeah uh , just .
wonderin how youre doin oh , hiya , ben .
sighs well , im im kind of nervous .
i was , uh , putting down some thoughts for tomorrow .
i dont wanna fuck up like i did .
ah , i dont think you will , jackie .
you was terrific this week , ben .
uh , if we dont make it , it wont be your fault .
and you were terrific , the whole trial , jackie .
thank you . thank you , ben .
that means a lot to me coming from you .
all right . okay .
ill see you tomorrow . good night , jackie .
ladies and gentlemen , i wont take up too much more of your time .
its been a long trial , and i dont want you to be away from your families .
any longer than you have to .
i realize i said a lot of things in this courtroom .
and i hope i didnt offend nobody .
but i just wanted to show you that im not a gangster . im just a gagster .
im not gonna read from this .
i promised you a long time ago .
i would speak from the heart .
now , i know the government tried piling up all this evidence in front of you .
they showed you photos , and you think its me and my friends meeting together .
its probably some kind of criminal conspiracy .
you see this picture .
you recognize that one in the middle .
thats me .
the rest of the guys are some of these men here as children .
this was , of course , way long before the government ever knew whojackie dinorscio was .
who was standing on a corner outside of an icecream parlor .
and you know what we were doing that day we were conspiring to buy ice cream .
if they had a rico law back then , they probably would have locked us up .
now , i know its .
its tough to decide who to believe in this case .
for 600 days , you guys have been sittin here .
they came in with tape after tape , witness after witness .
and they were trying to fill your mind with so much baloney .
that in the end youd think , oh , god , theres so much there .
there has to be something to it .
if you believe anything .
that any of those witnesses has said .
or if you feel that the prosecutor was right .
then i beg you .
please , dont take it out on my friends here .
if you have to blame someone .
then find me guilty .
you heard me right .
find me guilty , and let these men go home to their families .
you see , i already lost mine .
and i dont want their kids to lose their fathers cause of unclejackie .
so , send me to jail .
im not guilty , but im used to it .
thats all . i have nothing more to say . thank you for your time and attention .
i dont doubt for a minute that youll use them well to reach a just verdict .
the jury will now retire .
well , its over finally .
what do you think , ben its gotta be at least four days of deliberation .

its been 34 years since they arrived on this planet .
forced to live in barrier cities , do not live in fear .
i have vowed to end that fear .
i believe my dreams hold the key .
the question is , will i be in time to save the earth .

arrest me . but im not leaving without that life form .
its one of those days .
captain , the transport wont wait for us much longer .
i understand that . its in bad shape .
tell me were not risking our necks for this plant .
really , its a weed .
i wouldnt even call it a weed . i need a minute to extract it .
thats a minute we do not have .
im afraid hes right .
we have incoming .
captain , we need to get moving . understood , sergeant .
could you hurry done .
captain yes , neil .
im for iets get out of here .
duly noted .

youre gonna be all right .
so , why shouldnt i arrest you .
i am dr . aki ross . i have clearance to be here .
not without authorization . i dont have time for this .
do you realize you risked our lives .
the fact of the matter is .
it was worth your mens lives . your men .
she thinks youre a man . shes an idiot .
i know youre not a man . youre an idiot .
funny . i want to talk about it .
did it occur to you .
that we wouldve volunteered had we been given a choice .
nobody asked you to save me .
you have not changed a bit .
gray .
yeah . nice to see you too .
welcome back , captain . were clean .
lets make sure of that . i hate getting scanned .
its probably worse for us than the phantoms .
these machines are suspected of causing sterility .
i want to have a little neil jr . someday .
thats a spooky thought . quit busting my chops .
lets just do this thing .
yes , sir . yes , sir .
okay , next .
youve gained weight .
its upperbody strength . get a girlfriend .
im working on it .
my security rating allows me to bypass this .
not today it doesnt .
somethings not right .
about this mission or that woman both .
next .
listen , i think .
i dont care what you think .
youre getting scanned just like everybody else .
shit .
they got him .
there must be a mistake .
you came in contact with a phantom .
administering treatment shield .
what level blue . code red in 31 l2 minutes .
we have to treat him .
impossible . well transfer him to the treatment center .
theres no time for that .
get him to the table .
hang in there , captain .
locating pathogens .
jesus , look at that thing .
how much time .
not enough . when he reaches code red , the shield wont hold .
engaging bioetheric laser .
what whered it go .
what is going on .
weve lost contact . infestation is moving deeper .
tracking . theres no time .
tracking . youll lose him .
his treatment shield is failing .
found it .
youll be back to normal in no time .
doctor , we need to scan you for infestation .
that wont be necessary . ill take responsibility .
hey , doc .
thanks for saving him .
are you all right the military impounded my ship .
whats with her whats with her and the captain .
whats with her and that stupid plant .
forward me everything regarding the five spirits collected .
yes , doctor .
i thought we werent supposed to use the s word .
dont get smart with me .
now lets see if that plant does the trick .
its a match . weve found it .
the sixth spirit .
you broke nearly every protocol .
how long do you think this would have survived outside .
there are elements in the council and military waiting to shut us down .
look , 20 years ago , who discovered this energy in the phantoms you .
and who proved the same energy source existed in humans and every life form .
you . you made it possible to harness that energy .
for ovopacs , scanners , the barrier .
the council knows . they trust you . were so close to proving it .
but we still need these parts .
two more pieces and weve solved the puzzle .
we need to be free to find those pieces .
i want to show you something .
what is this read .
all life is born of gaia and each life has a spirit .
each new spirit is housed in a body .
through their experiences on earth , each spirit matures and grows .
when the physical body dies .
the mature spirit , enriched by life on earth , returns to gaia .
bringing with it the experiences .
enabling gaia to live and grow .
its my old diary .
i wrote that 43 years ago , when i was the age you are now .
dr . sid .
remember galileo they threw him in jail because .
he said the earth was not the center of the universe .
that could happen to us .
our ideas are unpopular , aki .
if you have any notes that could be used against you .
destroy them .
keep them up here . right .
and stay away from the captain .
he saves your life , you save his , this leads to that .
i was young once .
doctor , there is a war going on .
no ones young anymore .
members of the council .
could you please explain why .
zeus was completed a month ago .
if we attack the meteor , we will eliminate the phantoms at the source .
general hein , calm down .
we voted 6 to 2 .
to postpone using the zeus cannon to attack the leonid meteor .
id like to ask the director of the bioetheric center to speak .
dr . sid , please . thank you .
the phantoms nest is in the leonid meteor .
that landed here 34 years ago .
what you see now are the records of every assault on the meteor .
physical attacks have had utterly no effect .
this took place three months ago during a fullscale bombardment .
please note the phantoms outside the meteor are destroyed .
however , inside , many that were dormant come to life .
and as you see , overall phantom density remains the same .
the newly risen aliens respond to the attack .
by burrowing deeper into the earth .
this is very interesting to me .
because we see the same thing during surgery .
when using bioetheric lasers on phantom particles , do we not .
the injured particles escape .
digging themselves deeper into a patients body .
when we increase the laser power to destroy these deeper particles .
we have had incidents of further injury to a patient .
and in some cases .
death .
what exactly does that mean .
it means theres a very good chance .
the beam from the zeus cannon will burn the phantoms .
exactly thank you .
however , it also means that the beam energy may be too strong .
injuring the earth .
injure the earth .
you mean the gaia .
i mean you mean the spirit of the earth .
yes , the spirit of the earth .
did he say what i think he said .
i know what im doing . keep your mouth shut .
with all due respect .
did you come here to talk about some gaia theory .
to tell us that the planet is alive .
that it has a spirit .
thats a fairy tale . we dont have time .
it is not a fairy tale . it is true .
so if i point a gun at the earth and fire .
lm not just making a hole , im killing the planet .
the gaia theory has not been proven .
even if gaia does exist , wont we still have to remove the phantoms .
if theres a chance of success , we should take it .
dont you agree of course .
but there is an alternative to the space cannon .
another method .
a means of disabling the phantoms . please .
as we know , the aliens display a distinct energy pattern .
it is a fact that two opposing bioetheric waves .
placed one over the other cancel each other out .
it is theoretically possible to make a wave pattern .
in opposition to the phantom energy .
we are assembling such a wave and are near completion .
members of the council .
gathering plants and animals .
to fight the phantoms is utter nonsense .
the zeus cannon is a proven , effective weapon .
it will kill phantoms .
can we afford to wait for some crazy invention .
some army of touchyfeely plants and animals .
that offers no evidence that it will destroy the aliens .
there is evidence .
our partially completed energy wave .
has stopped phantom particles from spreading .
through an infected patient .
do you have evidence that a terminal patient was cured .
not cured . the wave is not complete .
weve succeeded in containing the particles safely inside the patient .
where is the proof .
you may have bought us some time , but at what cost .
i want what life i have left to mean something .
when we find the seventh and eighth spirits .
if we find them . what we need now is luck .
luck has nothing to do with it .
faith and hard work , girl .
because ill be damned if youre going to die before me .
the council decided to postpone firing the zeus cannon .
i guess i put on a good show .
mind if i tag along .
youll probably get bored .
so , what are you doing .
oh , i see . youre giving me the silent treatment .
im scanning the city for the seventh spirit .
hurry up , neil .
almost got it . what are you doing .
were gonna strand them for a while .
hey , it was his idea .
this was your idea .
were just helping the captain out .
wheres your sense of romance .
youve seen how the captain looks at her .
its amore , baby .
whats going on .
its probably just a glitch .
listen , aki im still mad at you .
youre mad leaving your helmet on .
not telling me who you were . that doesnt seem a bit childish .
i was upset when you left for the zeus station without a word .
now you know what was going on . now i know .
my operation had to be done in zero grav .
i was there on a job and you wouldnt even see me .
i was probably collecting spirit waves .
now i know . im sorry .
well , me too were both sorry .
will you tell me about them .
about what .
about the spirits youve collected .
i was infected by a phantom during an experiment .
normally , no one could have survived . how did you .
dr . sid created a membrane around the infection , keeping me alive .
so the first spirit wave was me .
the second was a fish . a fish .
the third was a deer i found in a wildlife preserve outside moscow .
the fourth was a bird .
ever tried to track a sparrow from outer space its no fun .
and then there was that plant i collected from times square .
i thought that was number six . what .
you skipped one .
the fifth was a little girl dying in a hospital emergency room .
i retrieved the sample in time , but she .
i told her everything had a spirit: dogs , cats , trees , little girls .
even the earth .
i told her she wasnt dying , but returning to the earths spirit .
to gaia .
she told me that she was ready to die .
she said i didnt have to make up stories to make her feel better .
only 7 years old and ready to die .
i have work to do . i have to find the seventh and eighth spirits .
dont , please .
you dont believe any of this , do you .
i just dont know , aki .
is this why you shut me out .
you should have told me .
i dont know how much time i have left .
who does .
i better get back to scanning .
captain edwards .
you extracted a dr . ross from old new york several days ago .
yes , sir . what were your impressions of her .
she seemed very capable and determined , sir .
you and the deep eyes are being temporarily reassigned .
you will guard dr . ross when she reenters the wasteland .
understood , sir . you dont understand yet , captain .
report any aberrant behavior in dr . ross to the major immediately .
aberrant behavior .
she carries an alien infestation . we dont know what its doing to her .
it might affect her judgment .
they may be manipulating her .
is the general suggesting that dr . ross is a spy .
the general is wondering why hes explaining himself to a captain .
shes had prolonged exposure to phantom tissue .
if this begins to manifest itself .
she is to be placed under arrest and transported here for observation .
it is , in fact , for her own good .
of course , sir .
major , send some of our men to keep an eye on the good captain .
im convinced these dreams are some form of communication .
the message still eludes me .
but theyre coming faster now and that can only mean one thing .
the phantoms inside me are beginning to win .
our target is 570 klicks west of tucson .
phantom concentration .
not good . weve got big metas everywhere .
its gonna be a real picnic .
stick close . no heroics today . everything by the book .
by the book . right .
if we drop energy buoys here , here and here .
we can acquire the target and get out before they know we were there .
the buoys attract the phantoms .
yeah . for a while .
youre from the 307th under general hein .
ever done wasteland recon before it can get pretty ugly .
captain , rendezvous for evac at vector 6 , coordinate 279 .
roger . stay alert for hostiles .
looks like theyve taken the bait .
the seventh spirit should be just beyond that line of wreckage .
how could any living thing survive here .
well find out soon enough .
this was the phantom cleansing mission .
it was supposed to end the war .
my fathers in here somewhere .
lets move out , people .
a survivor .
whats it doing out here .
hoping for life to return .
is that our spirit , doc .
were closing in on the life form .
distance hard to say . were very close .
i dont see anything .
youre not gonna tell me its him thats impossible .
its his ovopac .
how the pacs power our weapons , the barrier cities .
its just bioetheric energy .
to create that energy we use living tissue . singlecell organisms .
his backpack is the seventh spirit yes .
we have incoming . captain .
ryan , get the soldiers pac .
i need a hand sarge .
those buoys theyre not working . yeah .
are you all right of course i am .
lets get out of here .
this shouldnt be happening .
somethings attracting them .
aki .
theyre closing in fast jane , take the lead .
fire in the hole .
get us out of here , neil .
id love to , but just do it .
okay , thats it .
that doesnt look good .
we have to get her to a hospital .
you have your orders , sir . what the hells going on .
dr . ross is to be taken into custody now , sir .
lower your weapons . thats an order .
we relieve you of your command .
youll have to shoot me .
stand down , captain .
hang on , everyone .
thats enough . hands where i can see them .
deep eyes , hard to starboard .
neil , get us back to new york , fast .
the deep eyes are returning , sir .
there was an incident .
it would seem the phantoms were attracted to dr . ross .
the crew barely escaped with their lives .
captain edwards is still in command .
issue an order .
i want edwards and dr . ross placed under arrest .
all research materials pertaining to dr . sids wave theory .
are to be confiscated .
that might not go over well with the council .
what a tragedy that would be .
this is perfect . the good captain has opened the door for us .
the council will be at our feet .
thanking us for exposing the traitors and imploring us .
to save them from the phantoms .
how is she , doctor .
she is dying . there must be something you can do .
aki is fighting with only six of the spirits .
well have to implant the seventh directly into her chest plate .
i think it might be damaged .
we have to repair this panel quickly .
her vital signs are dropping . aki is slipping away from us .
she needs a sympathetic spirit to help hold her in this world .
i can think of none better suited for that task than yours , captain .
i dont understand . you dont have to understand .
you just be with her now .
you keep her here with us .
aki where are we .
on an alien planet .
how is that possible .
im not entirely sure .
you seem pretty calm .
ive been having this dream every night for months .
dream .
well , whatever it is .
youre really here , arent you .
whats happening to me .
sid is implanting the seventh spirit directly into your body .
then youre my spiritual support .
gray , how sweet of you .
look , i dont think you realize how serious this situation is .
something you should see here , sir .
and i am watching what , major .
it seems dr . ross has been recording her dreams .
and why would i be interested in .
her dreams .
this is it . this is our evidence .
shes under the influence of the phantoms .
the dreams should be all the council needs to authorize the zeus cannon .
the council is content to hide inside this barrier .
while the world dies more every day .
they need a push in the right direction .
get together a group of your most trusted men .
why are they staring at us .
not at us .
welcome back , captain .
is it over .
how is she , doctor .
shell be fine . but this is temporary .
well need to find the eighth and final spirit to cure her .
aki , can you hear me .
i finished it .
i know what it means .
i know what the phantoms really are .
nobody move youre all under arrest .
we have them , sir .
my wife and daughter .
were killed by phantoms in the san francisco barrier city .
did i ever tell you that .
i try to imagine what that must have been like .
seeing everyone around you fall over dead for no apparent reason .
and then , at the end , feeling something next to you .
invisible .
touching you .
reaching inside your body .
youve lost family , havent you .
thats why i trust you .
all of you .
you know what must be done .
security override .
perimeter breach .
major , arrest these men .
take it easy . stand up . go .
you are relieved of your post . dont ask questions .
reduce power to sector 31 .
what i realize .
is we must force the council to take action .
257%%% of energy pipe alpha redirected .
lowering power output to sector 31 .
barrier breach in sector 31 . theyre coming through now .
we can handle a few phantoms in a contained space .
relax , major . when this nights over , youre going to be a hero .
i dont but you saw it .
im not sure what i saw . how can you be .
captain , please , let her continue .
why do you think weve never been able to determine .
a relationship between the human sized phantoms and the giant ones .
excuse me , doc , but what frigging relationship .
you got your humansized phantoms , creepy caterpillary phantoms .
flying phantoms and my favorite .
down , boy .
if youve spent time in the field .
you know there is no relationship . its like a zoo out there .
i think the giant ones are like our whales or elephants .
but why would an invading army bring whales and elephants along .
unless their ship was a crazy noahs ark .
we have always assumed that the meteor .
was intended as a form of transportation . perhaps not .
the meteor is a chunk of their planet that got thrown into space .
when they destroyed their world .
but how could they survive the trip across outer space .
they didnt .
this makes a creepy kind of sense .
what do you think .
i think that explains why we never had a chance .
all our strategies are based on one assumption: .
that we were fighting alien invaders .
think of the dream , gray . how they died .
since then , all theyve known is suffering .
theyre not an invading army .
theyre ghosts .
how many phantoms .
more than enough to convince the council .
excellent . sound an alert . send a squad out to eliminate them .
alert status . full deployment .
i have numerous phantom contacts .
of course you do .
outside of sector 31 and moving at incredible speed .
what the hell is going on .
theyre in the pipes .
theyre moving with the bioetheric energy flow .
thats impossible . nothing could survive in those pipes .
weve got a big one heading this way . meta class , sir .
hold your fire .
what have i done .
come on , neil . we need a way out . youre our man . think .
these walls are titanium alloy and the bars are pulsesonic lasers .
its not like i can just wave a magic wand and .
neil , im impressed . that makes two of us .
proceed to the nearest evacuation facility .
we should proceed to the nearest evacuation facility .
here they come . but the others dr . sid .
deep eyesll take care of him .
why can we see them now .
they must be carrying a residual charge from the barrier .
behind you .
all aboard , captain .
we need to find my ship .
if it was towed here , it would be in the military hangar .
thats a big if .
look out .
get us onto the platform .
okay , now what .
were going through the station .
with all due respect .
excuse me , captain . the station .
were going through it .
its the only way .
so i gather this will be somewhat of a rough ride .
youve got a talent for understatement .
hang on , everybody .
doc .
interesting .
anybody hurt captain .
oh , god . talk to me , sarge .
give me a hand . right .
theyre in my ship .
no . no , doc . no drugs . captain .
you heard the man .
well be back .
ill stay with him . me too .
nobodys staying .
just give me a gun . you got it .
give him a weapon . do it .
well be back for you .
i hear you , captain . now , get out of here .
lets move out .
a quadaxle atv . this is good .
it can be used to retrieve ryan and bring him here .
well need to replace these spent fuel cells .
there could be some live ovopacs in the hangar .
check the hangar . neil , get us ready for takeoff .
aki and dr . sid , prep the quatro .
ill go rotate the airtray .
this city may be lost , but we are not . lets do this and get out .
be careful .
you too .
oh , yeah .
neil , do you read me .
loud and clear , captain .
this babyll fly itself .
flight path is set .
beginning rotation .
stop the airtray . we have a problem .
an impound tractor is attached to the ship .
can you disengage from the cockpit .
permission to go outside and detach the coupling .
do it .
theres the problem .
the controls are locked , naturally .
you think well get out of here alive .
i wonder if anybody else has gotten out .
you think anyones made it this far .
will this eighthspirit stuff work against the phantoms .
what if its all mumbojumbo .
can we stop talking im trying to concentrate here .
whats happening down there .
nothing we cant handle .
neil , whats your status almost there .
get back inside .
were fine . jane is negotiating with extreme prejudice .
talk to me , jane .
no problem here , captain .
yes captain , we are good to go .
jane , get out of there .
get out of there now go jane .
get the hell out of there .
the shield is powered and ready .
where are you going to the cockpit .
were in countdown to liftoff .
no , wait . its too dangerous . aki .
over here , you son of a bitch .
gray , do you read me whats happening .
you and sid are getting out of here now .
no we cant just leave everyone . everyones dead .
im not leaving without you . sorry , but you dont have a choice .
goodbye , aki .
gray , come on .
i just .
i wish i could believe they were in a better place .
i enlarged the scanning perimeter .
to include an area that we had previously overlooked .
the impact crater .
strange place to find the eighth spirit .
yes , really quite astonishing .
but nothing could survive in there except phantoms .
precisely .
which suggests that the eighth spirit is a phantom spirit .
i cant explain it at the moment , but once we get down there .
you will understand wait , doctor . thats a oneway trip .
yes , i expected thats how you would evaluate our chances .
well , am i wrong .
no , i agree . we probably .
wont live long enough to extract the eighth spirit from the crater .
then why even try it .
because we dont need to extract the eighth spirit .
if we cant bring the final spirit here .
we can go there and complete the wave inside the crater .
yes , exactly .
and how do we do that , exactly .
i can construct a device that .
would attach to akis chest plate to gather the eighth spirit and .
and what .
and then we wait and see what happens .
thats it .
thats your plan we wait and see what happens .
oh , good . well , i got my own plan .
we keep scanning the surface from orbit .
and maybe well find a compatible spirit somewhere else .
i say we go in .
what caused the barrier to fail , general hein .
im afraid it was only a matter of time .
before the phantoms developed an immunity to our barriers .
but i am relieved to see that you and the council .
were able to evacuate to houston without incident .
it was a terrible loss suffered this evening .
the council has reconsidered your proposal to fire the zeus cannon .
i see .
we are transmitting the access codes to you now .
and , general .
best of luck to us all .
prepare to fire the cannon .
the target , sir .
the phantom crater .
preparing to drop in three , two , one .
powering the shield .
okay , were over the meteor .
do you have it in sight , doctor .
there are so many of them .
wait .
yes im tracking the eighth spirit along the craters surface .
all right . now lets take a closer look .
ready to fire in three minutes .
ovopacs at maximum . transferring plasma flow to auto .
counterthrusters are engaged .
lox flow decoupled . status is green .
we have something on radar over the impact site , sir .
its her .
just a traitor under the influence of the enemy .
continue the countdown .
well take them all out at the same time .
were closing on the phantom . contact in 30 seconds .
target locked .
ready to fire on your command .
its a match its a perfect match .
scanners ready . fire .
what was that .
its the zeus . theyre firing on the crater .
are you all right a little shaken . stand by .
sid , the eighth spirit is not on our scanner . do you have it .
the eighth spirit .
has been destroyed .
what will we do now nothing . this mission is over .
lets get out of here . incoming .
if youre getting us out , you better do it now .
hold on .
i cant hold on to you .
unable to maintain altitude .
emergency landing procedures .
come in . come in , please .
aki , gray , can you hear me .
i need to talk to the station . can you patch us through .
what is that thing i dont know , sir .
incoming message , sir .
general hein , cease fire immediately .
what youre seeing is the living spirit of an aliens home world .
their planet was destroyed and landed here .
this is not an invasion . it never was .
i see . what have we been fighting all this time ghosts .
yes . spirits that are confused , lost and angry .
right . and these spirits are coming out of this gaia thing .
you have to listen .
alien gaia , earth gaia . even if i believed that .
the earths under attack from an aggressor .
who must be destroyed at all costs .
the cost may be the entire planet , sir .
firing on the alien gaia will only make it stronger .
since youre under the aliens influence , ill take it that were .
taking the correct action .
so take your last few moments and prepare to meet your gaia .
continue to fire until the invader has been destroyed .
general , the systems overheating .
well hit again and keep on hitting it until its dead .
but were not even sure if its having any effect .
no effect weve got them on the run , soldier .
this is our moment of victory . i order you to fire .

it wouldve gotten a different energy signature .
that set it apart from the other phantoms .
you couldnt have hoped for a better location .
to find a new compatible spirit .
whatever you do , dont move . stay right where you are .
staying where we are isnt as easy as it sounds .
dont shoot any of them .
you could very well destroy our last hope .

combat strategy is your area of expertise , captain , not mine .
i have a reading in the fissure . see it .
yes a compatible spirit . it must be very near you .
well which one is it which one .

yes , i read you . this is wonderful .
i dont see how you found the final spirit .

conners have been reinstated into full active duty .

looks whos talking about destroying lives .
i still remember your fucking specialty carlso .

i was first in the scene and i have seniority .
decision have been made burney .
dont do this , mark . dont caved in to this guy .
burney , i need you to take a hike .
well talk about it later .

first time i heard swat deferred anyone .
i want you to do the folks in the bank a big favor .
by proving me very wrong about you , ok .
thats an order .
anything questionable today , i want to know about it , ok .
yes sir .
looks like you got yourself a babysitter .
we had approximately 4 to 7 heavily armed men .
holding unspecified number of customers and employees hostages .
the only demand so far is to speak to you .
get me a line into the bank and see what they really want .
well well well .

i needed to have someone who have been through this experience before .
ive planned to live a long full rich life .

but im back your information is hold .
forget what you paid for .
well , i guess you want to know about the hostages huh .
theres approximately 40 .
and they doing just well .
all of them except one .
someones dead .
you cant expect to keep the hostages in check .
if you let a bad deed go unpunished .
what else would i be looking for .
demands .
wouldnt it be too much to ask you and your colleagues just to back off and bounce .
safe to say it .
alright you just stay by the phone and ill contact you .
wait lorenz .
dont worry , i dont have any playing until sunrise tomorrow .
relax , its going to be a long one .
come on lorenz this conversation is not finish .
patience detective patience .
we dont want this to be another pearl street , do we .
hes out .
this stand off is reaching 2 hours now .
weve been told that the detective have made contact .
with the perpetrator inside the bank .
but whether theres specific demand we cannot confirm .
but when we know , well let you know .
im karen cross , live for channel two news .
where is our phyllis captain .
he went uptown to brief the commissioner .
nicotine gum .
you quit smoking .
caffeine too , if you must know .
whats a man capable of changing .
detective , 15 rings and no answered .
try again in 5 .
what are they doing in there .
wasting fucking time .
precisely .
he knows police protocol not to mention the shit while on the precinct .
he disguised his voice probably he got a record .
and done this before .
hes buying time .
just trying to figure out his next move .
he wasnt expecting us .
he wasnt expecting you .
he said he thought you were suspended .
hes stalling .
he almost had what he came for .
were going in .
where is this swat commander .
ill find him .
thats a big call , you thought about what you doing .
were you questioning me .
unfortunately .
look , the hostages is in eminent danger .
they already confessed killing someone .
ready to go in .
so what we got .
snipers up top 10 soldiers on the ground .
whats the best way in .
tear gas blow the doors .
hold on , no explosives .
we have 40 civilians in there .
any other way .
no , there are no pussy ways in .
the doors are locked electronically from the inside .
we aint getting in without force .
what if we cut the power and disable the system .
we can open the lock manually and go in that way .
that will work .
so well take the pussy way .
we cut the power and we go in at 11:15 sharp .
banks are equipped with emergency generator .
which one the power is down .
itll kick back on in approximately 3 to 6 minutes .
well be in before then .
commander , your men in position .
standing by .
call for the power to be cut .
once down , wait for me signal .
nobody move until i give the go .
understood .
you should just shut the fuck up .
here they come .
stand still bitch i said dont move .
ok , lets go round the horn .
one check .
two check .
three check .
four check .
here we come .
cut the power .
were moving in .
stand the fuck down , commander .
its a trap .
no , you stand the fuck down , its my show now .
repeat do not go in .
on my count .
three two one .
you see anyone coming your way .
no , no one by us .
detective , we found this .
glove , mask , vest .
we let them walk right pass us .
we got one telebank .
the two that were strung up .
they are alive but they were in critical conditions .
a few of the swat in second degree .
that depending on who do you want to talk to .
there was between 5 to 9 perks .
and nobody saw them because they were wearing mask all the time .
we background check on all the hostages .
they are suspect until they are not .
i need to hear the conversation between conners and lorenz again .
well , you have to wait .
an hour , maybe more .
can you show me how to play myself .
look , it doesnt work this way , ok .
i dont take order from you .
i dont know you and no one touches my stuff , ok .
youll have to wait .
what the hell are you doing are you a.d . d .
along with what they stole on the war zone that left behind .
a mans dead and the killer is running free .
i dont have time to wait , ill figure it out myself .
thank you for your help .
the tapes are inside , alright .
that wasnt so hard , was it .
dont break anything , ok .
what about this one .
thats the camera in the vault .
it got blown in the first explosion .
thats when you cut the power .
so we cant id them .
have vincent check it out .
conners , you better comes in here .
oh shit .
detective conners join us , will you .
for better or worst , hes an allied for the united states .
last month in charlotte north carolina on the .
crown valley bank was hit with the same amount .
so what was in the box .
we dont keep records .
the boxes are private .
look , this is fascinating shit .
what about the money .
so they broke into a bank and didnt steal any money .
we believe the princess vault was their target .
we trying to reach them now , ok .
im curious , are you familiar with the terms franchise size fuck up .
what this is my fault huh .
im beginning to understand , why they didnt want to deal directly with you .
you think you smart , apparently .
but man are you stupid .
boss , that is not fair , everything is according to procedure .
you came to me .
i thought so .
you wanted to stab .
good god i did not .
but it had to be somebody .
i think lorenz is trying to tell us something .
the way he spoke , pause between certain words .
do you ever heard of chaos theory .
edward lorenz invented the chaos theory in the 1960s .
try that again .
pretty much at initial stage .
well , that will be all , thanks .
you were college boy .
which one .
you doubt .
so its the ladder .
how you end up on the force .
its kind of a family business .
listen , do we need to get to know you all the crap .
couple hours ago you didnt give a shit .
you grown up , mate .
beside , i entrusted my life to you .
i should know something about you .
i know about you detective .
everyone does .
not much to be enthusiastic about .
if you been through the shit i have , then you can judge me .
conners , come in .
go ahead .
i have something you want to see .
detective , cant stay away from me , can you .
yeah , right there , perfect .
damien richardson .
career loser .
i busted him couple a year ago on an attempted robbery .
what hes doing back on the street .
he gave up his partner and cut a deal with the d.a .
got his address .
gina , its the police .
open up .
step back .
are you hit .
i got it .
stop gina .
terry .
im a police officer .
that guy is a murder suspect , i need your bike .
i want my fucking lawyer .
fuck you lawyer .
hes unconscious but hes stable with a nice knock on this forehead .
hey wait , stay cool .
give it a rest , im fine .
you sure youre alright .
gina lopez , 28 , has 2 kids .
am i interrupting .
gina claims that she doesnt know anything about bank robbery .
of cause she doesnt .
vincent .
im sorry detective , when we first met i didnt realize who you were .
i worked with your dad .
basically right after i got out from the academy .
it was an honor .
thanks vincent .
the father was heavy decker .
detective ready for you .
are they going on a trip .
looks like it .
you looking well moony .
hi , moony .
shane .
can we back to work now , please .
we have passport , suntan lotion , bermuda shorts .
bikini , and this .
must be fifty large .
you think , right .
well , dont put words in my mouth .
first of all , every bank has their own money bend .
and this is not american global .
after a little checking with world international financial .
that sounds familiar .
4 months ago , half a million dollar was stolen in an armed robbery attempt .
special rep job .
smell it .
when evidence comes in , any physical contact can make it hard for the prints .
so now , to mark the bills .
we just spray this directly on it .
is that new .
yeah , liquid of the future .
so this money is not from our bank .
this one is from the worlds national job .
for the list of things that you can put in my mouth .
conners .
who handle the worlds national case .
i think it was callo .
well , you said it was a family business .
i didnt realize it .
guess i didnt connect the dots .
dont worry about it .
you father was a hero .
yes , he was .
first , i thought you were related to the captain .
no , no relation .
we found the money , gina .
the money was damiens .
the money came from our evidence room .
i told you , i dont know about a bank robbery .
whatever damien was into , i know nothing about it .
so where were you going .
vacation .
this is felony murder one .
and you are protecting him .
get alive .
i didnt do nothing .
you want to walk out of here alive , you tell me something now .
im done talking , i want a lawyer .
since you insisted a lawyer , ill take your kids .
wait you cant take my kids away from me .
what do you care .
fuck you you cant cheat me like this .
i have right , you know .
you cant take my children away from me .
i can and i will .
just tell me what i want to know .
i think for the first time of her life , shes telling the truth .
the serial numbers marty faxed me .
according to our computers , that money should be downstairs .
you got to sign this first .
heard you were back .
kind of not like having you around , carls .
have another donut , harry .
drugs , weapons , cash .
millions .
its sitting here for the taking .
not if you were a cop .
just pop by in and take whatever you want .
here it is , line 17 .
you lost your fucking memory , harry .
you know how many times someone sign shit out of here .
i see the same guy all the time .
i cant remember one incident 2 weeks ago .
if thats his signature , he signed for it .
take it up with him .
the money from richards place trace back to the worlds national heist .
burney sent the money out of evidence himself .
2 weeks ago .
4 hundred and 33 thousand dollars .
if it is callo it would explain how they would know police protocol .
and how our department operates .
that also explain why he was so pissed this morning about being replaced by conners .
he doesnt need another reason to be pissed by me .
no motive .
do we have one .
pressure .
no , i dont buy that .
he was also getting divorce .
about a month ago , he told me he and his wife might be splitting .
i didnt think it was serious .
this doesnt make any sense , guys .
they never do , captain .
come on the facts speaks for themselves .
no , they dont .
why if carls is involves , why didnt they ask him to the bank .
jenkins .
mrs . callo , do you feel ok to continue .
wife came home approximately 45 minutes ago .
there were no force entry and no one saw anything fled from the scene .
guys , blue prints of the bank .
so thats it .
detective carls .
you are putting on the pieces together .
they wouldnt have punish him but i will .
vengeance will be mine , detective .
then come and get me , you piece of shit .
i think the cop will be smarter .
so callo was involved , and now they are dragging you into it .
the man said he wanted vengeance .
so i just got off the phone with agent doyle .
and apparently after the shuttle breaks and the prints .
withdrew all these possessions from every safe deposit box in the country .
they didnt touch the cash .
all the safe deposit boxes .
and they break into a bank blow it up and steal nothing .
is this makes sense to you .
after today , it makes sense .
return to the earth now .
if your mind is in trouble , your heart is in search .
is your find .
detective .
we go back to where it all starts .
we go back to the bank .
the kit is confirming 5 bad guys but since the vault came blew .
and its a total mystery .
look , i have been through this tape 3 times .
its tiring , its nothing .
shut up , dex .
wait , hold one a second .
did you see that .
see what .
go back a little .
look closely to the camera angles .
they all fixed , right .
they dont rotate or pam .
ok , play it .
camera a dominates our attention because of the explosion .
while thats happening , check out camera two .
where are you going .
he shear the angle .
watch it 20 times , dex .
whats in that corner that they dont want us to see .
watch your eyes .
check them all .
you got it .
dex .
yes sir .
can you hack into this .
hack into a nationwide bank security system .
yeah , i love to hang on .
so what do we do at the meantime .
do you like italian .
he can talk to an elephant .
guys , please , continue .
the buddha was trouble so he goes back to where he came from .
to find the path .
the answer .
when you hit a dead end , go back to the beginning to find your way .
or something like that .
we have a genuine philosopher i must admit .
are you a buddhist .
no , just something i picked up along the way .
but you are religious .
not particularly .
you guys all are very tight .
we been through a lot together .
even when things get pretty wild today when everybody else panic .
he was in control .
what are you doing .
being around you , all these things happened again .
i think i made a mistake .
you made your choice .
now live with it .
they got a match .
they got a name .
chris lei .
the prick used to work for a big time software company .
so they caught him pirating programs .
couple of years later he was busted hacking into a pension plans until the time comes .
lets say for a genius , he is a fucking moron .
this is your case .
was it true .
the guy was guilty .
hes a scum .
look , theres something they dont teach you .
the system breaks down , you have to compensate to get the result .
that gives you the right to break the rules .
bend , not break .
it means justice absolutely .
i bet you will , chris .
first day in the city and youre already been shot .
just grace him .
what if i just grace you with a bullet see how you feel .
take five guys .
hey damien , how you feeling .
no flowers for me .
fuck yourself .
may i .
you remember me , dont you damien .
now we gonna give you one chance .
one chance to tell us what we need to know and help yourself .
just one chance .
i was skiing 3 years ago in aspen .
beautiful country .
have you ever been there , damien .
landed on a sheet of ice and slammed into a tree .
broke myself up pretty bad .
kind of like you today .
i was in the hospital bed for 3 months .
morphine .
makes you feel nice , relax , calm .
no pain .
but .
if i were to inject this whole thing .
this equipment malfunction all the time , damien .
overdoses are quite common .
besides , i dont think that the d.a . is gonna launch a full scale .
investigation over a scum like you .
you dont have to tell us anything .
roll the decks .
ill talk .
bend , not break . thats what you said right .
hes also the brother of john curtis .
when conners shot him at pearl street bridge .
now we also have another two accomplices names .
lamar galt .
and xander harrington .
everybody was suppose to meet up tonight at 10 .
and we havent had the address .
hes planning of finishing them off tonight .
how your decision affects them .
had murders in his eyes .
if he only done what i said , drop the weapon .
and hes ought to be .
my dad died when i was 12 .
he went into a liquor store in the middle of a hold up .
the guy just opened fire .
he didnt have time to react .
they said he was a hero .
you know what that means for a 12 years old .
cause he died on the job , hes a hero .
it doesnt make sense to me .
thats why you become a cop .
finish what he started .
everyday he went out trying to do some good .
help the people couldnt help himself .
just give him a chance thats what he always says .
didnt know itll work out , but he tried .
you tried to help save the girl on the bridge .
if you werent there , the girl will still gonna die .
now relax and get the line freed .
im out of gum .
look man , cover me , ok .
no , stand down .
we got 3 cars , uniform back up in all directions .
nobody goes into the house until i say .
drop the gun .
last warning .
get out of the house .
get out of the house now .
where is conners .
you son of a bitch .
you always been jealous of him .
jealous .
its because he wasnt just a better cop .
he was a better man .
detective , go home .
is there something you want to say .
no sir .
carls is right , we shouldnt have gone in .
fucking dumb of me .
detective , i know what are they doing inside the bank .
these are the record transactions of the bank .
and average a day produces about 3 to 400 pages give and take .
today , they were over 3,000 pages .
we just witness largest bank heist in the history .
about a billion dollars .
they planted a computer virus .
they randomly withdraw money from all the accounts .
and deposit it into the bad guys account .
now , if you look at all the transactions .
no 2 amounts are the same .
and none of them over 100 of dollars .
you see , most of the security systems work the size of the money .
where is the money now .
what do you mean you dont know .
so the money still moving around .
so why break in if they were just wiring money .
couldnt they do it anywhere .
no , you see .
thats the original managers computer terminal .
from there you have a limited entry into the bank mainframe .
so theres no more working around password .
theres no hacking in just straight forward .
nice and clean .
a billion dollar is missing and we discovering it now .
ironically , when you guys shut down the power .
it bought us time to work .
what you going to do now .
i think this is beyond our jurisdiction .
its not over yet .
no , my wish is to catch you .
youre a murderer .
a cop killer .
i know about the money .
you steal a billion dollar and well find you .
it doesnt add up .
what doesnt add up , detective .
he said he didnt kill anyone who has been disserted .
curtis called you .
and now they are screwing up your head .
you did good today , shane .
your father will be very proud of you .
get some sleep .
there will be more bad guys for you tomorrow .
what are you talking about .
all day long .
we thought callo was a dirty cop .
all day long we were wrong .
here is one callos report .
they are not the same signature , harry .
and now , were getting close .
maybe he get a cramp in his hand , i dont know .
so you set him up .
you forged callos signature .
you give him the money and you help him with his plan .
everybody got a raw deal .
youre helping a cop killer , harry .
my conscience is clean .
and im tired , harry .
its like we are chasing a phantom here .
how the hell does curtis know callo better than anyone .
we are not talking about curtis here , arent we .
who will know callo better than anyone .
who will you protect .
it was lorenz the dirty cop .
that pulls off one of the biggest robbery in the history .
watch me .
can you get a location on him .
oh hang on .
that will be 8:48 please .
keep the change .
this is the police .
put your hands in the air and get down on the ground slowly .
dont shoot .
just be cool , ok .
get down on the pavement .
you win .
get down on the pavement , now .
im cooperating , ok .
be cool , ok .
im just putting my hat down .
i didnt ask you to put your hat down .
put your hands where i can see them , thats final warning .
i say , i give up alright .
final warning .
drop the weapon and let the girl go , its over .
nope if you want to bring me in , you have to work for it .
that you dont want to do .
well , thats interesting .
thats exactly what i said to him .
two months ago , i was in your shoe .
asking myself , what should i do .
what would you do .
you do exactly what i did .
you try to make a different .
everybody out get out .
yeah , im fine .
which way did he go .
he went towards the peer .
it just that its so sad .
no heroes are coming to safe the day .
i think callo will be sorry that you die .
ill read the paper .
you read one of his taxing books .
did we all get shot today .
yeah , they said the city will be busy .
everyday like this .
pretty much .
i wonder whats next .
do you really think im gonna charge you after all that .
i need to know any passenger named james gleik check in .
one moment officer , we have to check the machine device .
quickly , please .
think about it a minute .
doesnt that blow your mind .
harry and the phone call .
that wasnt him that my friend was a mistake .
i tell him you have to leave room for an error .
when you got that i was impressed .
all day long we were trying to figure out whos the inside source was .
it was you .
surprise .
terry pretty devastated about your death .
shell get over it .
youre a serial killer .
oh yeah who have i killed .
what about callo .
callo deserves this fate .
its his fault .
so this is all callos fault .
oh look at that .
you technically trying this on purpose .
so why not kill me you have plenty of opportunities .
its not about killing , shane . its about standing up for what matter .
besides , you kind of grow on me .
youre not going to get away .
i already have .
im not even here now .
oh yeah whats that .
you dont always win .
all your years of service for nothing .
youre hypocrite .
im an opportunist , ill be glad to die in the line of duty .
but they took that away .
the system broke down .
good luck , detective .
it has been an interesting partnership .
but i have to go now .
thank you .
id like the captain know we are ready .
i am sending you the code .
yes i see that , thank you .

well it shaping up to be another beautiful 4th of july weekend .
if youve got any big plans , you better get started early .

so another golden oldie for all the commuters out there .

it is credence .
credence credence .
classic rock . i know who it is .
it is old rock , that does not make it classic .
what sucked back then still sucks now .

it is like having a pine cone shoved up my ass .
ok , really .
wow how mature .
come on man .
we are at a heading of 060 . making another pass .
are we ready .
the transportation hubs are prepped and set .
begin stage 1 .
when was the last time you tuned in your radio to pop music .
give me any decade .
was it the seventies .
did michael jackson still play .
pearl jam . im going back about 10 years .
ten years .
twenty years . the cure nothing .
its called news radio .
im trying to see if any of your friends from camden made the headlines .
hold on .
you listen to the news yeah , you have a problem with the news now .
yes , i have a big god damned problem with the news .
are you ready for this .
the news is completely manipulated .
everything that you hear every single day .
is designed by corporate media to do one thing only .
to keep you living in fear .
oh fear total fear .
fear so you will go out and spend money on things .
things you probably dont even need . things you should already be sick of .
so that their advertisers keep buying adds on their stations .
and i tell one more thing . are you ready for this .
i can do this all day man . ive got days of data at home .
ill drop a bomb on you bigger .
hey shut up .
thats good , thats good , be dismissive .
are you ok no , i am not ok .
stay in the car . you will be ok .
hey man hey .
how are you doing , you alright .
just call 911 , alright .
all of the lights are green .
lets go , right now .
we gotta go lets go .
get your bag hack boy . lets go .
jesus . lets go .
ive never been in a crash . are you alright .
well it is very exciting . this way , here we go .
have you ever been in a car accident yes , i have been in a car accident .
what are we doing .
a little thing they invented back in the 60s , its called jogging .
sir , chicago is reporting a system crash in their train network .
amtrak is flashing a level 1 crash of their system .
f.a.a . just issued a critical alert . their atc net just went down .
we are under attack .
lets get them outside for a little bit of fresh air .
that is the anthrax alarm .
alright , everyone out , now .
taylor , move , go .
move .
all personnel must evacuate and proceed to the shelters immediately .
this is not a drill .
take the team and go for the fourth floor . got it .
masks on .
make it happen , ok .
research the data from these crashes , .
see if you can id the point of origin .
begin stage 2 .
hey what is going on .
what is happening .
they are already starting to panic .
of course they are .
they think that someone is taking their money .
all of those nickel and dimes they saved .
useful idiots , as lyman would say .
prep the video package .
dc transportation system is crashing .
and they just hit the financial sector . everything .
call the secretary of trans , the treasury and the director of f.c.c .
lets go people .
somebody , somewhere , has left a digital fingerprint .
find it .
is deputy director bowman in here .
not now it will have to wait . not today waxworks .
this is matthew farrell .
i brought him here on direct orders from bowman .
so if you dont know whats going on , find me somebody who does .
i am bowman .
the video package is ready for upload .
listen , john .
i thank for bringing farrell , but everything�s changed this morning .
we are neck deep in damage control right now .
scuse me , im sorry , sir .
do you have something to eat any snacks around here .
i would love i am really low on blood sugar .
as if the crash of the traffic system wasnt bad enough .
the stock exchange was in a selling frenzy this afternoon .
the commission believes this panic may have been caused by computer malfunction .
it is believed to be related .
its not as bad as it looks .
we run drills to prepare for things like this .
are these your suspects they were .
all seven were killed in the last 24 hours .
do you recognize any of them .
not one .
you need to see something here .
my fellow americans .
it is time to strike .
fear into .
the citizenry .
ask not .
its not an authorised broadcast .
what your country can do .
to avert this crisis .
the answer is nothing what so ever .
our military strength .
is in this case .
useless .
read my lips .
the great .
confident ruler .
of the american .
progress and .
growth has come to .
an end .
all the vital .
technology that .
that this nation .
possesses .
all communication .
transportation , internet .
connectivity .
electrical power .
critical. .
utilities their .
in our .
hands .
we will not tire .
we will not falter .
and we wont fail .
i dont know how they are getting in .
and a happy .
independence day for everyone .
that was creepy .
i tried to find more nixon .
do you think they bought it .
absolutely .
ok .
i want telecommunications , transports and .
jesus christ its a fire sale .
its a fire sale .
hey , we dont know that yet .
it is a myth anyway . it cannot be done .
oh its a myth really .
please tell me shes only here for show and shes not actually in charge of anything .
what is a fire sale it is a three step .
it is a three step systematic attack on the entire national infrastructure .
ok step 1 : take out all the transportation .
step 2 : the financial base and telecoms .
step 3 : get rid of all the utilities . gas , water , electricity , nuclear .
basically everything that is controlled by a computer .
which nowadays is almost everything .
so thats why they call it a fire sale because everything must go .
hey , listen , whats your name .
farrell keep your voice down ok .
nobody here is talking about a fire sale .
not unless you are telling me you helped plan one .
no man , im just saying .
we appreciate the concern , we know what we are doing , thank you .
what nothing , i said i understand .
hey , they didnt send the girl scouts to get this kid .
they sent professional guys , full tactical gear , .
they blew the whole joint up .
now look , i dont know this kid .
and , frankly , i dont give a shit . no offence .
but somebody wants this kid dead .
and obviously , its got something to do with whats going on here .
humler is taking over the interrogations , .
of the hackers that we are bringing in .
i will get you an escort over there .
right molina , get this kid to the front of the line .
i want to know what he knows . right .
if he knew about half of what i know , his fuzzy little head would explode .
special agent johnson . i will take you there .
agent johnson thats right .
so is any of what you were saying possible possible .
ok look , i will tell you again . if you take away any one thing , no problem , .
but if you take it down all at once , the system crashes , and .
look around , man .
come on , the government has got to have dozens of departments dedicated to that shit .
it took fema 5 days to get water to the superdome .
how long until we get to the dept . of homeland security .
lauflin , get on the police band and get them to clear a route to the d.h.s .
dc metro , this is the f.b.i . , requesting you to .
farrell just resurfaced on the grid .
the feds are taking him to homeland .
good , close that loop now .
isolate the frequency .
locate the vehicles and get me john mcclanes file .
brad , we just found farrell . stand by for location .
i dont mean to harp guys but .
but have just passed another snack bar and i am starving .
shut up . i need to eat .
shut up . you have 14 minutes to tell me why you lied to me back there .
did i lie to you what are you talking about .
the pictures on the wall . you knew those guys , right .
i , wha , i kid , dont lie to me .
i am a cop , i can tell you are lying . who are they .
ok , ok ok .
they were my competition .
make the next right onto concord .
they said they were a software firm that had developed some kind of .
a new algorithm .
and they just wanted to see if it could be cracked .
thats what i do , i do math based security .
heres the thing , .
the thing that ive been thinking is that if you can do something this massive .
you need tons of startup guys to write the software .
but only a few black hats .
to actually implement that stuff .
so then the startup guys who havent really done anything .
like me end up as pictures on a wall .
i swear to god mcclane i had no idea i was gonna be .
an accessory to armageddon .
take the next left at lexington .
and thats a sexy voice .
what is she taking us this way for .
unit this is dispatch clear a route for two f.b.i . vehicles .
f.b.i . we have cleared a path .
thats her her who .
what are you talking about .
it is them .
are you saying its them them i swear to you , i know her .
i would know her voice anywhere .
dont say anything . keep you mouth shut for a second .
hey metro , hows your day going over there .
gotta be crazy over there with all these 587s , huh .
yes , sir , we had to dispatch all units .
yeah you had to dispatch all units , .
for all the naked people walking around .
cut the bullshit honey and just put your boss on .
lauflin , we are getting off this route make a left here on 14th street. .
officer mcclane . that is detective mcclane , asshole .
dont worry though , we will have plenty of time to get to know each other .
when i come visit you in prison .
but , john , i already know so much about you .
your address in brooklyn .
the payments on your mortgage , how long you have been in the nypd .
and how is holly thats sad , you are divorced .
was that tough on little jack and lucy .
after thirty years , i would have thought you had a better pension plan .
oh and it gets worse .
your 401k no longer exists .
tell you what , let me make it up to you .
box them in at that intersection .
shoot mr farrell in the head , and drive away .
by the time you get to the end of the next block , .
all your debts will be wiped clean .
and your children will be set for life .
that really is tempting , especially that last part .
but i think ill pass , jerk off .
john , you are a timex watch in a digital age .
you are gonna lose .
yes , well the other thing that can happen , it is that i can come and find you .
kick your ass and throw you out of your own party .
what do you think about that dickhead hold your position .
he is not responding .
down , get down .
officers down at the corner of main with constitution .
i repeat , officers down .
come on , come on , get out lets go .

youve been here before john .
get over to the wall , sir .
the feds called in a favour .
all you gotta do is pick up a kid in jersey .
drive him down to dc .
how hard can that be , huh it cant be that hard can it .
no , gotta be a senior detective .
think that a traffic jam .
or throwing a car at me will stop me , huh .
red , get in there and get it done . it wont be necessary , he is leaving .
this is not a good idea .
dont touch me ok ok alright .

jesus , you just killed a helicopter with a car .
i was out of bullets .
how you doin .
i skinned my knee and my asthma is acting up .

the teams are arriving at woodlawn now .
very good .
mai , get ready for the downloads .
identification , sir .
park behind the transpo and we will guide you in .
man the gate , you come with me .
the anthrax alarms only went off across five floors .
below that you will need clearance .
i dont know why you would need to go down there .
there is nothing down there but servers .
all clear . rodriguez .

the gate is secured . copy .
ok , we are in .
hey , this is absurd there is tough and there is stupid .

the server is ready .
we are go .

excuse me thank you .
kid kid hey .
you got a phone in that bag yes .
come on lets go .
and here you go , agent tavarek . i guess thats you .
the download is at 20% .
time to move . lets keep them chasing their tails .
due to the recent activity .
law enforcement agencies are being extremely cautious .
they are telling people to abandon vehicles , until they are searched .
and as you can see .
k9 units are checking each vehicle .
now whether this is connected to the anthrax reports earlier .
or if it is a new terrorist threat we dont know that this stage .
faa just grounded all flights .
good . sir .
we have complete access over system networks .
phones , power grids , water , nuclear .
hey , excuse me dan parry , the nsa .
chuck summer dhs liaison . the white house made the call .
anything you need , we are here to help .
help wow . thats , thats great .
we are gonna need some work space for our people .
what can you do for us .
well as you can see , we are using the space .
you guys can stand in the corner , .
and if i need something .
ill just wake you .
wait , no no . dont call . what .
what are you talking about they probably cracked that hours ago .
if you use it they might be able to trace us here .
just put in your pocket . sure .
or smash it , you didnt have to smash it .
excuse , me . police emergency .
hell call you right back .
here , wait in here .
do you have a signal yes .
this is john mcclane for agent bowman .
sir , john mcclane is on the line .
mcclane , go .
we never made it to dhs .
they came for the kid again . all your men are down .
and what about farrell yeah hes here with me .
sir hang on , john .
another day in paradise .
they just swamped everything , .
the whole telecom system . phones , cellular , satellite .
they are blanketing every station .
can you put the news back on this is the news .
it on every channel , its been like this for a few minutes now .
mcclane .
look out .
bowman do you see that .
mcclane bowman .
its a fake .
i see it .
thank god .
the satellites down . get me a landline .
one little piece of code and the world falls apart .
this is virtual terrorism . what .
its crazy , the first time that i heard of a fire sale .
i actually thought it would be cool , if somebody did it .
hit the reset button .
melt the system , just for fun .
hey , it is not a system .
it is a country . we are talking about people .
a whole country , full of people .
sitting at home , alone .
scared to death in their houses , alright .
so if you are done with your little nostalgic moment .
maybe you can think a little and help me catch these guys .
just help me .
just put yourself in their shoes .
come on .
if this were your fire sale , what would be your next move .
ok , the point of a fire sale is that it is mostly done by remote , right .
but not everything is run completely online .
major utilities arent , they are run in closed circuits .
you can breech the security up to a certain point , but .
to shut it down you would have to physically go there .
you know what , give me that guys pda .
the phones dont work , they are all dead .
no the phones are fine it is the network that is dead .
i only need to reprogram it .
and link it into the old satcoms , hackers surf them the whole time .
it is probably what these guys are using to talk to each other .
how do you know all this stuff .
dude , i dont know .
i couldnt explain it to you .
the national power grid , gas and the electricity .
they are divided in to three zones , right .
eastern , central and western . each one with a primary hub .
here it is .
what is that , what am i looking at that is the eastern hub .
now , they take this out .
it wipes out all the power for the entire eastern corridor .
but again they will have to do it manually .
come on , lets go . what , to west virg�nia .
i honestly dont think i can handle any more people trying to kill me .
mcclane , mcclane oh you get used to it .
mcclane . oh , shit .
sir , wireless networks are down they are hitting the landlines too .
i dont care how , you find me a line .
come on , what you got .
we swept the whole building , it seems clean . we can .
sweep it again , but dont bother .
it is fake . these guys planned this .
alright get everybody back inside the crisis centre , now .
lets open it up .
come on , get in .
the door is locked . unless you have an extra gun to unlock it .
hey , dont do that .
youre gonna disable it shit .
wow , crazy , did you see that .
sorry about that man . i didnt know it would come out so fast .
how did you do yours .
are you alright what , did it hit you a little bit .
please , dont touch those , ok i know what am doing .
i have done this before .
i mean , i have read about it .

thank you , dolores .
pass the p.d.a . i gotta call the warlock .
the what warlock , he is a digital jedi .
mam you are not authorised to be here .
f.b.i . we suspect there has been a security breech .
you have landed without authorisation .
that was pretty good back there , kid . thanks .
what�s the matter , nothing to complain about no , just .
what whats the problem im not like you , .
i cant do this shit .
what does that mean like what like heroic and everything .
i am not that guy .
nobody here is a hero , kid . you saved my life like 10 times , .
in the last six hours .
i was doing my job , thats all .

believe me if there was somebody else to do it .
i would let them do it . theres not , so were doing it .

hey , dont touch that alright cb radio .

4 years ago the d.o.d . recruits thomas gabriel .
to be a cyber spook for them , ok .
first day on the job he goes and tells his bosses .
that the nations security infrastructure is wide open to compromise .
and what did they say we will take it under advisement .
but he doesnt ease up cos he is committed , like you read about .
so he breaks into a meeting of the joint chiefs of staff , ok .
using just a laptop he hacks into norad .
and shuts down the entire defence network .
so they put a gun to his head and forced him to stop the hack , .
thomas gabriel is the guy who shut down norad with a laptop , .
just to prove a point , you think im scared of you .
just tell us how to find the guy . i dont know how , he is a ghost .
he just fell off the grid .
another dead end , come on . hold on wait , mcclane , .
listen , warlock , a couple of weeks ago i wrote this .
i know dude , you wrote a mutating algorithm security code .
thats probably being used right now by thomas gabriel .
no , we know that , yes .
can you tell us what hes using it for ive been trying to figure that out. .
here , look .
the only system i can find using that kind of security , .
is the social security administration , ok .
they dont even use it in the main facility , look .
they use it in this building , over here , woodlawn .
what the hell .
i know , right right , what .
what the hell you guys talking about .
the power consumption is off the charts .
its hot , on fire .
the chilling towers thats what i thought .
hello , whats a chilling tower jees , see what ive been dealing with .
large server farms generate a lot of heat , they need to be cooled .
why there .
i dont know what is in that building but i assure you its not social security numbers .
i have a red flag over here , someones hacking into woodlawn .

freddy , what the hell are you doing , meddling in my network .
mcclane i thought id killed you already .

detective , covering the camera with your hand , doesnt turn off the microphone .
i know that am not as smart as you guys and this computer shit .
but hey , im still alive aint i .
i mean you got to be running outta bad guys by now , right .
gabriel .

your father sounds like a very smart man .
kid , can you get bowman err , yeah .
its completely dead .
gabriel must have shut down all of the satellite links . shit .
im sorry about lucy , man .
all of it .
it is my fault you got into this , this wasnt your fight .
you have nothing to be sorry about .
this bitch is a handful .
are you gonna be alright .

oh yeah lets step outside , just you and me .
we will see who hurts who .
you really are his daughter . tie her wrists .
trey gabriel wants to see you .
is it that time already yes .
ill be back in one second .
dont kill me please .
we are showing a breach in an external vent .
go take a look .
dont be long , we are packing up soon .
hey , mcclane .
do we have anything resembling a plan or anything .
to find lucy and kill everybody else .
i mean like a plan , like a way to do that .
ok , according to the layout , the chilling towers are kept on the bottom level .
it should be locked .
ok , now it looks like we are getting somewhere .
ok this looks like it controls the cooling system for the mainframe , which .
should be .
if i can just hack in .
and trip the alarm , it might alert bowman .
somebody set off the alarms .
yes , thank you detective . i can hear that .
find a way to turn it off .
we got a problem .
the alarms went off at woodlawn .
its got to be him .
and whats , woodlawn .
its n.s.a .
a secure facility outside of baltimore .
its a failsafe we built after 9/11 .
to backup all financial information .
the moment the networks were hit all the financial data .
it automatically began downloading to those servers .
banks , wall street , corporate records .
government funds , all of it .
basically a backup for the accumulated wealth of america .
all in one location .
what could gabriel do with it if he could get in he might try .
a transfer of the data to a portable hard drive , .
then he can have access to those accounts anywhere .
syphon of billions for himself .
we would have no way to trace it .
but knowing him , he could erase it all .
and send us back to the stone age .
why the hell wasnt i told about this .
frankly .
its above your pay grade . my pay grade .
how did gabriel find out about this when i didnt even know .
he designed it .
it was his program .
he knew that hacking your system last night would trigger the download .
thats brilliant .
you two , geniuses , stay out of my way .
let me see if i can get a floor plan of this place .
you get away from the bag now .
we�ve been waiting for you .
have you .
ive been waiting for you too .
kid .
matt kid .
emerson .
we seam to have a problem in one of the cooling towers .
tower 7 . tower 7 .
find out whats going on . i will see to it . ok .
get the hr team to stand by . we need to get woodlawn , now .
the roads out , completely blocked . dcs in total gridlock .
then get us some helicopters .
they have all been pulled by the pentagon , for search and rescue .
molina , find me some god damned helicopters immediately .
look , the pentagon has jets flying cap over dc .
have them send one over to woodlawn and keep on eye on things until we get there .
where is my daughter .
russo , check in .
i think russo is on his way down to meet your girlfriend , dickhead .
hes on the third floor , the kid .
did you get all that .
thats right .
i am on the third floor , but im coming to get ya .
dont move , pal , i will send a doctor .
kill this guy and i will give you mais cut .
my algorithm .
please god .
please god .
my jesus , they are going after the money .
you coming to get me , john is that the plan .
yep , thats my plan .
what makes you think i wont put a bullet in your daughters head , right now .
because you are scared of me .
is that right , you think i am afraid of you .
cos otherwise she would be dead already .
you need a bargaining chip .
stop there hands up .
if you kill me youll never get it open .
move away . move .
you know john , i feel like we have gotten off on the wrong foot .
and cos of that you think im the bad guy , .
nothing could be further from the truth , im the good guy here .
i told them this could happen if they didnt prepare .
did i get a thank you no , i got crucified .
but they wouldnt listen . you got their attention now dont you .
i am doing the country a favour .
ha ha , by tearing it apart .
better me than some outsider , .
some religious nut job bent on armageddon .
nobody wants to see that happen .
everything ive broken , can be fixed .
if the country is willing to pay for it .
ah bullshit its always been about the money .
what , i shouldnt get paid for my work .
im workin my ass off here , john .
just sit tight asshole , i got a cheque for ya .
i cant talk to this guy .
you talk to him , see if you can get him to focus .
now there only 5 of them .
hang on , lucy , im coming .
would somebody , please , kill this son of a bitch .
there actually no problem here i just got off at the wrong floor .
this is a mess .
wow , im truly impressed , man .
hacking all the financial data of the whole country would take weeks , .
unless you eliminated the congestion .
thats what this fire sale is about isnt it .
its brilliant . yes , it is .
please , be quiet . asshole .
who are you matt farrell .
lucy mcclane .
i thought your name was gennero .
lucy gennero .

maybe , if i had enough time .
that is encouraging .
we take them with us .
lets go . lets go .
gabriel , the pentagon just sent an f35 towards us .
keep an eye on it .
pulling the go codes now .
might wanna start thinking what you want on your headstone , asshole .
damned , hamster .

be still , spider boy .
thats right .
seriously , you probably shouldnt antagonise them since they have all the guns .
listen , will you just take a minute and dig deep for a bigger set of balls .
because you are going to need them before we are through .
wow , i know that tone .

confidential .
expensive mr . potter , .
it arrived to the knowledge of the ministry .
which to the 18h23min this night .
you executed a patrons sorcery in the presence of a bundle .
being a serious violation .
of the restriction decree to the magic practice for minors , .
you is expelled .
of magic school and hogwarts witchcraft .
hoping that i feel well mafalda hopkirk .
justice .
sorry , edwiges .
very clean these foolish . tonks , for gods sake .
teacher moody .
what is doing here rescuing you , are clear .
we where go the letter said which i was expelled of hogwarts .
but you did not go , not yet .
kingsley , explain . the letter tells .
dumbledore convinced the ministry the not expuls� him until a formal audience .
audience yes .
do not worry harry , explain everything when we come back to the thirst .
here not , ninfadora .
i do not me call ninfadora .
keep the formation .
and they do not go out from her if one of us die .
go in front , son .
it is time to enter in action .
it is the first sorcerers thought .
he thinks with your return .
talk a little lower .
it gets stronger every minute , we have to act now .
harry mrs . weasley .
how good that you feel well .
starving . but i fear that dinner will have which wait until the meeting finish .
a without time to explanation .
direct upwards first door to the left .
which kind of scum that they they let enter her home .
what my mistress would he tell to the monster .
what a shame .
do not worry , madame . the monster is here .
we keep knowing that it was attacked by dementadores again .
it needs to to tell us everything . lets him breathe , hermione .
and this audience in the ministry .
it is outrageous .
i already searched , they ca not expel you .
it is much injustice . it is .
it has been existing much injustice , hermione .
so , what is that place .
it is the thirst .
of the order of the phoenix .
it is a secret society .
dumbledore founded her when they fought against youknowswho .
they could not have counted everything in a letter .
i passed the whole summer without news .
we wanted to write , harry . we wanted same .
but but the what .
dumbledore did us swear to do not count anything .
did dumbledore tell that .
but why he wanted do let me in the darkness .
perhaps i could help .
after all was i who it saw voldemort return .
was i who fought with him and who saw cedrico be killed .
we think i was you talking . do not repress your rage .
it uncovers .
if already it tired of the little talk what it thinks of something more interesting .
and if anybody ask it is harry .
if you were not by harry , no we would know that voldermort came back .
he is a child , molly . and do not i know as well .
he is not tiago .
harry it is not your son .
they are dead .
the ones that he has . he still has to me .
how touching that paternity feeling .
perhaps potter grows for be an equal criminal to the godfather .
it stays outside this , snotty .
snape also belongs to the order . shit .
i do not care for what dumbledore said .
and should not i know .
then why do not you talk .
bichento .
bichento . it is quiet .
hermione , i hate that cat . bichento ugly .
we are going to eat in the kitchen .
just because you they can use magic .
it does not mean that ought to use the rod for everything .
it is hungry , harry .
it is very same , harry you gave us a fright and so much .
harry potter .
sirius .
it seems that your audience in the ministry it is in front of the supreme whole cut .
i do not understand . what the does magic department have against me .
show him .
he is going to discover soon .
daily prophet the boy who mind .
he is attacking dumbledore as well .
fudge is using his powers .
inclusive the influence his in the daily prophet .
to dirty the name from whom tells which the lord of the darkness returned .
the minister thinks dumbledore it wants his job .
what a madness nobody in i perform judgement would believe that .
there you are fudge is not with the perfect judgement .
it was perverted and blunt by the fear .
the fear obliges the people the terrible things , harry .
of last time that voldemort it took over .
he almost destroyed everything which appreciate most .
now that returned , i fear that the minister .
go to do everything the possible for avoid the terrible truth .
we think voldemort wants gather your army again .
14 years ago he it commanded many people .
not only bewitching and sorcerers , but several creatures of the darkness .
he walks recruiting many and we are trying to do the same .
but to gather followers not it is his unique interest .
we believe .
which voldemort is behind a thing .
a thing that he not it got in the last time .
it means , a gun .
no already it arrives .
he is alone a boy .
if you tell more , it is the even though i induced him to enter order .
great , i want to come in .
if voldemort is gathering a army then i want to fight .
you are expelled of the magic school .
trains in the underground these bundles are very smart .
we arrive .
i never used the entrance of visitors before .
should be fun .
we just place money .
the daily prophet ladies and gentlemen .
anyone it can buy your prophet .
is dumbledore deaf or dangerous .
good morning , arthur . good morning , bob .
they are memoranda interdepartamentos .
before we used owls . the confusion was incredible .
by merlins beards thanks , quinsley .
they changed schedule of your audience . when is it .
in 5 minutes .
mysteries department .
minister , you is going to do what is right , is not it .
yes , the dream oughts to .
mind you , in the audience only talks when they talk to you .
it did not do anything of wrong .
as they tell the bundles: the truth is going to appear .
is not it it is .
fear that ca not come in .
good luck , harry .

witness for defense: .
target percival wulfrico .
brian dumbledore .
it received the communication that the hour and did the location of the audience have changed .
should have lost .
but for a happy mistake , arrived to the ministry three hours earlier .
accusations .
the accusations against the defendant are the next: .
which he deliberately , .
it executed patrons sorcery , .
in the presence of a bundle .
do you deny the execution of such a patron no , but .
you know that it is prohibited to use magic outside the school with less than 17 years .
yes , i .
esteemed sorcerers and witches of the supreme cut .
i only did it for cause of dementadores .
dementadores .
in little whinging .
that is very creative .
bundles ca not see dementadores , can they boy .
very convenient .
i do not be lying , i had two their e .
i regret to interrupt what it would be a very very rehearsed history , .
but as it ca not bring no witness for the event .
excuse me minister .
but actually , can .
please , describe the attack .
how were they .
one was very great , and the other very thin .
not the boys , dementadores .
it feels well , well .
great .
with coatings .
after , everything stayed cold .
as if to all happiness it vanished of the world .
sometimes , see , dementadores not they roam by the foolish suburb , .
and they attack a sorcerer , the chances are very remote .
i do not think someone believe that dementadores , .
they were there for minister coincidence .
i only could have understood wrong teacher .
dementadores are after all about control of the magic department .
it can sound strange , but it sounded , for a moment , .
which you would have suggested that the ministry , .
he would have salary the attack to the boy .
yes , it would be disturbing same madame sub secretary .
because of this i am sure that the ministry it will do a complete investigation , .
to know because two dementadores they were so far from azkaban .
and because they attacked without authorization .
of course there is someone .
which it can be behind the attack .
corn�lio .
i implore that hear the voice of the reason .
the evidence that the lord of the darkness returned .
it is incontestable .
he is not back .
in the that tells respect harry potter .
the law tells clearly , .
which magic will be able to be used ahead of bundles in life risk cases .
laws can be changed if necessary dumbledore .
clear . it is already normal practice promote a criminal trial , .
to care for a simple in case of teenager magic .
those in favor of the condemnation .
those in favor of acquit the defendant of all the accusations .
innocent of the accusations .
teacher .
cushions .
did you go nuts .
it is going to deteriorate all the operation .
sirius , what is doing here if someone see you .
i had to see you leave , did not have .
what is life without some risk .
i do not want to see him coming back for azkaban .
do not worry with me .
anyway .
wanted you it stayed with that .
the order of the original phoenix .
marlene mckinnon .
it was killed two weeks after take this photo .
voldemort finished with all the family of her .
franco and alice longbottom .
parents of the neville .

already we passed 14 years .
there is not a day that i not miss of your father .

it seems to be as before .
stay with her .
finally .
i suppose that you be the young people now .
hi , harry potter .
i am surprised that the minister have let you free , potter .
better to seize while it can .
i am sure that already it has one cell in azkaban with his name in her .
what i talked you .
completely crazy . stay far from me .
it is malfoy .
what it waited .
hi personal .
hi neville . hi neville .

good night children .
we have two changes in the teaching staff this year .
it is a pleasure have back to the teacher grubblyplank .
for creatures magic treatment .
while the teacher hagrid it is of temporary license .
i also want to give the welcome the teacher , .
of defense against the arts of the darkness , the teacher dolores umbridge .
i am sure that all they will join me .
to wish to the teachers good luck .
as usual , our concierge , mr . filch , .
it asked me to remind you .
she was in the audience .
she works for fudge .
thank you , director .
for these nice welcome words .
and as it is lovely .
see you radiant and happy , smiling at me .
i am sure that we will be all very good friends .
very unlikely . very unlikely .
the magic department .
always considered the education of young sorcerers and witches , .
of vital importance .
despite each director have brought something again for this historical school , .
the progress , by the well of the progress it needs to be discouraged .
we will preserve what should be preserved .
improve what it can be improved .
and prohibit practices that should be prohibited .
thanks teacher umbridge , it was same very enlightening .
enlightening .
how much daring .
it means that the ministry it is going to intervene in hogwarts .
plotter .
dino , simas .
good vacation good .
better than the one of simas .
my mother did not want which i came back that year .
it lets me see because of you .
the daily prophet has talked a lot of you harry .
and about dumbledore as well . and your mother does it believe .
well , nobody was there in the night that cedrico died .
reading the prophet , you and your sheass mother they are going to know all that they need .
do not talk about my mother this way .

good morning children .
levels exams ordinary of magic .
n the m s .
known most as: .
noms .
study a lot and they will be rewarded .
let that and the consequences will be able to be severe .
their previous instructions in this matter , were , too much improper .
but they will get happy in know which from now on are going to follow , .
a carefully structured course and approved by the ministry , .
of defensive magic .
there is not anything here about the defense sorceries use .
sorceries use .
i do not manage to imagine because they would need to use sorceries in my class .
do we go magic .
you will be learning about defenses sorceries , .
of a certain form and without risks .
so that that we are attacked will not be without risks .
students should lift the hand to talk in my class .
it is the vision of the ministry , .
which a study theoretician will be enough , .
for faz� them pass in the exams .
what an after all , it belongs to the which if treatment school .
and as it is just that the theory in the it prepares for what is outside .
there is not anything outside , dear .
who you imagines that would it attack children like you .
i do not know . perhaps lord voldemort .
now , we will let that .
very clear .
they talked for you who a certain sorcerer of the darkness .
it is at large again .
that is a lie .
it is not a lie , i saw , i fought with him .
mr . detention potter .
then second you , cedrico diggory fell dead why he wanted .
the death of cedrico diggory it was a tragic accident .
he was murdered voldemort killed him you know .
enough .

you did not give me ink .
it will not need an ink .
because you know , at the back .
which deserves to be punished .

woodsclass kit . sweet that let you sick .
it liberates you of the class in the hour that you want .
pleasure hours when he need .
it wants more one .
i do not want does everything for me . please .
i am busy studying for these nomss exams .
i do the introduction , anything else .
hermione , you are the person more wonderful that already i knew .
if i am rude with you again .
i am going to know that you it came back to the normal .
what it has to wrong with your hand .
to other hand .
you should tell to the dumbledore . no .
dumbledore already has much thing in the head now .
anyway , i do not want give this satisfaction to umbridge .
devils harry , the woman it is torturing you .
if your parents knew about this only that i do not have parents , do it have rony .
harry , you have to report that .
it is very simple no , is not .
hermione , be what it is is not thus simple .
you does not understand .
but i want to understand .
dear cushions , .
i hope that i feel well .
it is starting to stay cold here .
definitively the winter it is arriving .
in spite of being back to the hogwarts , i feel more only than never .
i know that you , above of all , it is going to understand .
hey , harry potter .
their feet .
are they cold a little .
unfortunately all my shoes they disappeared mysteriously .
suspect who narguil�s be for tr�s of this .
what are them they are called trest�lios .
they are very kind , but .
people avoid them because , they are a little .
different .
but because the others does not it manage to see .
they only can be visas for people who already turn the death .
so , you know anybody who died .
my mother .
she was a witch extraordinary , but , .
she like doing experiences .
a day a sorcery gave wrong .
i was 9 .
im sorry it is , it was doing well horrible .
i get very sad because of this sometimes .
but i have my father .
both of us believe in you , by the way .
which thatwhodoes not ought to benominated it came back , .
which you fought with him , .
and that the minister and the prophet they conspire against you and dumbledore .
it seems that you are the only that believe .
i do not think that be true .
but i suppose that it is this way which he wants you if you feel .
what it means .
well , if i was youknowswho .
he would go want you if it felt isolated of all .
because , if you are you alone .
it would not be a menace very large .
do you never stop of eating .
the what i am hungry .
can i join you .
me sorry teacher , but what is insinuating .
i only asked that in the that tells respect to my students , .
you follow the rules prescribed discipline .
it can seem foolery , but it sounded , as if .
it was questioning my authority in my own class room .
minerva .
in any way , dolores .
just their medieval methods .
me sorry dear .
but to question my practices , it is to question the ministry .
and for extension the minister in person .
i am a tolerant woman .
but we have a thing which will not tolerate , .
it is disloyalty .
disloyalty .
the things in hogwarts , are very worse than i feared .
corn�lio will have to immediately act .
educational decree 23: dolores joana umbridge was nominated , .
for the position of high inquisidora de hogwarts .
educational reform .
already having revolutionized the didacticism of defense against the arts of the darkness .
dolores umbridge goes as high inquisidora have powers , .
minister fudge places education first .
to adjust the standards unacceptable of the school of hogwarts .
just a dear question .
you are in this position , there is how long exactly .
it registered before for the position in the defense against arts of the darkness .
but it did not obtain success .
prohibited musics .
products weasley they will be banished .
vestiments appropriated to the decency .
you could , please foresee anything for me .
move their mouths .
a teeny prophecy .
what a pity .
no , no hang on .
i think i saw something , yes .
i see something dark .
you runs great danger .
cho , what is happening .
it is the teacher trelawney .
sixteen years that i live and i teach here .
hogwarts is my house .
you ca not do that .
i it is .
it means anything , dear .
there are several things that i it would like to tell .
dear calm .
teacher mcgonagall .
i can ask to carry the it sibilates back into .
for here , dear .
thank you . for here .
dumbledore .
i owe lembr� him , .
which by the terms of the decree educational number 23 , .
promulgated by the minister .
you have the right of fire teachers .
but it does not have authority to banished them of this location .
that can pertence to the director .
for now .
should not be studying .
teacher dumbledore .
that cursed g�rgula .
we are not learning to defend us .
we are not learning to pass in the nons .
she is possessing herself of the whole school .
safety was and always will be the larger priority of the ministry .
moreover , we we have convincing proofs , .
sirius black .
what is doing here answering your letter .
he said that it was worried about umbridge .
what is she doing training do you to kill halfbreed .
sirius , she does not let us use no magic .
that does not surprise me .
the last information they belong that , .
fudge does not want you trained in combat .
combat .
what does he find which are do form a sorcerers army .
it is exactly what he finds .
which dumbledore is gathering all the forces to take the ministry .
he becomes more paranoiac every minute .
the others .
they do not want i count that for you harry .
but the things will not go nothing well in the order .
fudge blocks everything the whole time .
and these disappearances .
they are exactly of the appearance which started before .
voldemort is acting .
what we can do .
someone is coming .
sorry to not help .
but for now , at least .
it seems that you they are independently .
he is same outside , is not he .
we need to be able of defend us .
and if umbridge refuses to teach us we need someone who teaches .
that is madness .
who would go to want be taught for me , i crazy am reminds .
see by the good side .
you ca not be worse that the guy .
thanks , ron .
whenever need .
who is going to find us there .
only some people .
lovely place .
i thought it would be safer and it would mislead people .
come back here .
you know because we are here .
we need a teacher .
an adequate teacher .
one that has experience in if defend against the arts of the darkness .
why why .
because youknowswho it came back , idiot .
it is what he tells . it is what dumbledore tells .
dumbledore tells because he tells .
the matter is , where is the proof .
potter could tell more about as diggory was killed .
i do not am going to talk about cedrico .
it is because of this that are here , they can go away .
lets go , hermione .
they only came here because they think i am an aberration .
it is true that can do execute patrons sorcery .
i already saw .
oh harry , did not know which managed to do that .
and he killed a basilisk .
with a sword in the room of the dumbledore .
in the 3rd year he fought against hundreds of dementadores of once only .
and last year he fought with youknowswho in person .
look .
it seems great when talked this way , but .
the truth is that i had much luck .
i did not know what to do many times , and always had help .
he is being modest . not hermione , do not be .
face these things in the real life , it is not as school .
at school if you be mistaken , it can try again tomorrow .
but outside .
when you are to a according to of being dead , .
or to see a friend die , ahead their eyes .
you do not know how is .
you all right harry , we do not know .
because of this we need of your help .
because we want have the chance of defeating .
voldemort .
is he same back .
first need a place for train without umbridge discover .
the house of the screams very small .
the prohibited forest it is not going to come out right .
harry , what happens if do umbridge discover .
who we import .
i tell .
until is touching , is not it .
break the rules .
who are you and what did with hermione granger .
finally , at least know a thing certainly of this meeting .
which .
cho did not manage to take your eyes , are not .
near days will draw up a list of places that can practice .
we have to be sure of be there where is , nobody discovers .
all student organizations are from now on dissolved .
the student who disobey it will be expelled .
it where is going longbottom .
you got neville .
you found the room needs .
which room .
it also is wellknown like the room comesandgoes .
the room needs only appears when someone it needs very of her .
and always is equiped with that it is needed .
and if i needed a lot of a bathroom .
charmer , ronald .
but yes .
it is this the idea .
it is brilliant .
it is as if hogwarts it wanted fought .
expelliarm .
i am an useless . you are flowering the too much rod .
try this way: expelliarmus .
want please , copy the approved text four times .
to guarantee maximum learning .
it does not need to talk . much less think .
expelliarmus .
keep the rods .
estonteamento is one of the sorceries more useful in your arsenal .
it is an essential artifice for the sorcerer , so .
lets go , nigel .
give your better shot .
estupefa�a .
nothing badly same .
do not worry , i catch carries with you . thanks , ron .
lets go ron . lets go ron .
lets go ron .
she was already , ron .
a second . bet .
thanks . shut up .
i let her do that .
she would get bothered .
it was completely intentional .
all the students they will be interrogated .
about activities illicit suspicions .
it wants a tea cup .
now it concentrates in a fixed point .
and it try again .
very good , keep the concentration .
right .
a little higher .
i feel well i feel well .
the ones that they want to join .
to the brigade inquisitorial for extra credit , .
it owes if register in the high magic room .
reducio .
work last it is important .
but it has a thing that even imports .
believe in himself .
think thus .
all great sorcerer in the history started .
as nothing more of the which are now .
students .
if they manage to do that , .
why not we .
you get .
reducto .
fantastic neville , very good .
this was the todays lesson .
now we only are going to gather us after the holidays .
so , continue practicing alone the possible maximum .
and congratulations to everybody . great work .
very good , harry . thanks .
we see us in the communal room , harry .
thank you very much , harry . not at all .
merry christmas .
thank you very much it was not anything .
thanks . merry christmas .
thank you . merry christmas merry christmas .
have a great christmas , harry . you as well , luna .
we walk thinking , harry .
we could place some vomitilhas in the umbridges tea .
or febricolate . you stay with some full furuncles. .
it seems great boys . do give me license .
i knew that umbridge caught weighed with you that day .
at least , was worthwhile .
it is just that learning all this .
it does me think , which if he knew .
cedrico knew all of these sorceries .
only that voldemort was better .
you are a great teacher harry .
i never had gotten confuse anything before .
a visgo .
it probably is full of narguil�s .
what s�o narguil�s .
i do not have idea .
well and how was .
i tell , she was in half that crying .
you kisses badly same , hein .
i am sure that the kiss of the harry was more than satisfactory .
she has been crying almost the whole time these days .
some kisses would owe anim� her .
it does not understand like her should be feeling .
it stands to reason that she is in sad by the cedrico .
confused to like harry , it feels blamed by t� him kissed .
in conflict with umbridge who wants fire her mother of the ministry .
and afraid of do not pass in the noms for being so worried about everything .
a person ca not feel all this .
she would explode .
that is because your emotional side it belongs to the size of a teaspoon .
voldemort oughts to be behind something .
something that he not it got of the last time .
in the dream , you was it close to the victim .
or i sell the scene of the high none of the two .
it was as .
teacher , it can tell what is happening .
everardo .
arthur is of watchman tonight .
it assure of him who is found by the right people .
mr . dilys .
go to your portrait in grimmauld place .
tell them who arthur weasley is seriously wounded .
and that his sons are going to arrive soon there , by the portal key .
they are already with him target .
it was almost but they think it is going to survive .
once again the lord of the darkness it did not get acquired her .
thanks . lets go .
look at me .
what is happening to with me .
it wanted to see me , director .
severo , i fear not we can expect most .
neither by the sunrise .
if not , we will be vulnerable .
if he already knows about this connection , do not yet know .
pray so that he continue to know .
it means , which if he knows about her .
is he going to to read my mind .
read . control .
go mad .
it formerly was common the lord of the darkness , .
have the pleasure invading the mind of her victims .
creating projected images for tortur� them until the madness .
only after extract the last sanity drop .
only when it did them implore by the death , he finally killed .
used right oclum�ncias power , .
it can proteg� him of access or influence .
nestas classes i am going to try penetrate in your mind .
and you are going to try to resist .
prepare itself .
legilimens .
it is your curse .
it concentrate , potter .

if you were not for you i would not be in here .
harry harry .
i am going to want more of this . but daddy , no .
i do not manage to understand because you do not want to dress .
because i keep seeming an idiot , because of this .
not more than the normal .
fedelho arrogant stopped there is courageous .
the boy who detained the lord of the darkness .
friend of the bad blood and damned traitors .
if my poor loves monster .
it arrives from poison go away from here .
clear , boss .
monster lives to serve for nobleman marries of black .
me sorry because of this .
he never was very pleasing . neither when i was boy .
at least , not with me .
the what were you created here .
this is my parents house .
i offered her dumbledore , to be the headquarters of the order .
this was the unique thing useful that i managed to do .
this is the tree genealogical of the blacks .
my messed with cousin .
i hated her too much .
my parents with the habit their of pure blood .
my mother did that after i ran away from .
charming woman .
i was 16 .
did where you go .
near your father .
always was welcome in potters .
you have very of him m you harry .
you are very seemed .
i do not have so much certainty .
sirius , when i .
when i saw the mr . weasley be attacked , i was not alone sell .
i was the snake .
after , in dumbledores room , it had a moment that i .
i wanted .
this connection , come in voldemort and i .
and if the reason of her , it is that am i being alike to him .
i feel so much hatred .
the whole time .
and if after all that passed , .
something gave wrong within me .
and are it we turning me badly .
i want hear me with a lot of attention harry .
you are not a bad person .
you are a person very good .
to who bad things happened .
moreover , the world it does not divide into .
people good and guests of the death .
we all have light and darkness within us .
what it imports is the side by the which decide to act .
that is what we really are .
harry , hour to going .
when all this finish .
we will be a normal family .
you are going to see .
it did same .
hagrid came back .
i am going to talk that by last time .
i order that me tell where it was .
already he said , i was to care for of the health .
of the health yes .
breathe a pure air , you know .
clear , for a guardearths , pure air should be difficult to find .
if i was you , no it get used to being back .
actually neither it would inconvenience me in undo the suitcases .
that is highly secret , right .
dumbledore sent me to negotiate with the giants .
giant .
did you find them .
they are not so difficult of find to be honest .
they are so great , are not they .
i tried convenc� them the they join the cause .
but i was not the unique the try to do of them allied .
guests of the death . yes .
they tried persuaded them the they join .
and did they get i gave dumbledores message .
i suppose that any if remind of his friendship .
and did they do that to you not exactly .
it feels well , coma soon then your petted dog .
outside it is changing .
equal of to last time .
it has a tempest arriving , harry .
it is better are all ready when she arrive .
we confirm that 10 prisoners extremely dangerous , .
at the beginning of night yesterdays escaped .
of course the prime minister bundle was warned of the danger .
we have a great suspicion , .
if that the escape was schematized by a man .
with great experience in run away from azkaban .
the notorious murderer in mass , .
he is cousin of the fugitive , belatrix lestrange .
dumbledore warned to fudge which that was going to happen .
he is going to finish killing for not facing the truth .
i wanted to apologize .
now until my mother tells that the prophet is not so right .
what i mean is that .
i believe in you .
neville .
14 years ago .
a guest of the death called belatrix lestrange , .
it used the curse cruciatus in my parents .
she tortured them , to take information of them , but .
they did not talk anything .
i have much pride of being son of them .
but i think do not yet be ready so that all of them know about this .
we will do them if they make proud , neville .
that is a promise .
think in a very strong memory .
in excess happy than have . allow she performs you .
continue tried , simas .
right , it is your time now .
the corporal patron is the more difficult of produce .
but force shields also are useful against a variety of opponents .
fantastic gina .
mind you , the patron only protects while they are concentrated .
then they concentrate luna .
think of happier thing than can . expecto patronum .
i am trying , i am trying . i know , it is great .
it is a very advanced sorcery people , they are leaving itself very well .
i am going to find a way in this .
maxim bombard .
leave .
catch them .
i am observing them there are weeks , look , the armada dumbledore .
proof than i come telling right from the start , corn�lio .
all your dread about the youknowswho never deceived us .
we saw what her lies are .
a smoke screen for your attempt to take over the ministry .
naturally . no , teacher .
he did not have anything to see with that , was i .
very noble of your part harry , try protect me .
but how was pointed , the name tells clearly: .
armada dumbledore , not of the potter .
i instructed harry the form this organization .
and i , just i , am responsible for the activities .
send an owl to the daily prophet .
if she is fast will be published in the morning edition .
dawlish , shacklebolt you are going to escort dumbledore .
for azkaban .
to wait the trial for conspiracy and influenciamento .
i imagined that there would be this small upset .
you seem to leave of the principle of the idea that i will go .
without complaining .
good , go talk the following .
i do not have the intention of go to azkaban .
already it arrives .
carry him .
do not like his minister , .
but it ca not deny .
dumbledore has style .
dolores umbridge substittui target dumbledore .
like director of the school of hogwarts .
boys and girls ca not stay the less than 20 centimeters each other .
the ones that they want to join to me in the brigade inquisitorial .
it should repress the several illicit activities .
you did all that it could .
nobody it could go against the shrew .
neither dumbledore imagined which that would happen .
harry , if someone has blame , are we .
it is , we convince you .
it is , but i agreed .
i tried so much help and only i managed to worsen the things .
now it no longer matters anymore .
because i ca not play more with who imports too much .
the more you mind more you have to lose .
perhaps be better . the what .

and they are already dangerous when they are calm .
if the ministry restrict more the territory of them , .
they are going to finish with a revolt in hands .
hagrid , what is happening .
sorry be so mysterious with you three .

the lord of the darkness it is not resting .
you and black are alike . children weeping , always complaining , .
like life has been being it lasts and unjust with you .

they sent me do not inconvenience , and they ate everything alone .
very smart , rony .
sometimes i am . it was brilliant .
so , as we will arrive in london .
i do not be being ungrateful .
but i already brought enough problems .
dumbledores armada was formed to do something real .
or were they alone words for you .

then as we will arrive at london .
flying it is clear .
92 .
93 .
94 .
95 .
should be here .
that has your name .
the only with the power of defeating the lord of the darkness approaches .
and the lord of the darkness it owes marc� him as your equal , .
but he will have powers that the lord of the darkness will ignore .
but one ca not live while the other survive .
where is sirius .
you should know the difference .
come in dreams .
and reality .
you only saw what the lord of the darkness wanted you to see .
now give me to prophecy .
something were done with us , i break .
he knows how to play .
it is belatrix lestrange .
it is neville longbottom , he .
how will be their parents better now that will be avenged .
lets go , all of us be quiet , t� good .
everything p that we want is the prophecy .
why voldemort needed do of me to catch that .
you dares to talk his name .
filthy bloodbad .
all right , it is alone a boy curious , is not .
prophecies only can be left , for those to who were done .
what is much your luck .
sometime already we asked .
which the reason of the connection does come in you and the lord of the darkness .
why he not it got kill .
when you was only a baby .
you do not want to know the secrets of your scar .
all the answers they are there , potter .
in your hand .
all that has to do .
it is to deliver for me .
i can show everything for you .
i waited 14 years .
i think i can wait a little more .
estupefa�a estupefa�a .
petrificus totalus .
very good , neville .
reducto .
we will come back for the door .
they chose the right name , it .
voices .
they understand what they are telling .
i do not hear no voice , harry .
we will leave from here .
i also hear .
harry , it is alone an empty portal .
please , harry .
back of me .
it believed same .
or it really was frank , of think .
which children would have chance .
against us .
i will do the easy things for you , potter .
give me to prophecy , now .
or it see your friends die .
do not deliver for him , harry .
stay far from my godson .
listen , want pick the others and leave from here .
the what no . i am going to stay with you .
it lets i care for now .
very good , tiago .
avra kadavra .
i killed sirius black .
do you come catch me .
crucio .
you need to want , harry .
she killed .
she deserves .
you know the sorcery , harry .
do .
so weak .
which foolishness come here this night , tom .
aurores are already on way .
when they arrive , i already will have party .
it will be dead .
you lost , gaffer .
so vulnerable .
they are not the similarities come in you .
they are the differences .
you are the weak .
and it never is going to know love or the friendship .
and i feel sorry for you .
you are a fool , harry potter .
and you are going to lose .
everything .
is minister going to if dismiss .
umbridge suspends pendent investigations .
thatwhodoes not ought to return .
director of hogwarts reinstitu�do .
i know as if it feels harry . .
it is my fault . no , the blame is my .
i knew that i was a times matter , .
until voldemort do the connection between you .
i thought me moveing away of you , .
how i did during whole year , he would stay less tried .
and thus you would be in more protected .
the prophecy told: .
one ca not live while the other survive .
it means that one of we it goes have to kill the another .
in the final .
why he did not tell me .
by the same reason that you tried to save sirius .
the same reason that their friends saved you .
after all of these years , after all that you suffered , .
i did not want to cause you more pain .
i worry too much with you .
why is not it in the party .
i lost all my things .
it seems that people they were hiding them .
that is horrible .
it is alone joke .
but as this is the last night , i need everything back .
it wants help to search .
im sorry by the your godfather , harry .
it is sure not it wants help to search .
well , my mother always told , .
which the things that we lose , they finish coming back for us in the final .
not always of the form which wait .
i think i am going to eat pudding .
i was thinking about something which dumbledore said me .
what is .
despite terms one battle by the front , .
we have a thing that voldemort does not have .
we have .
yes , what is it .
johannes is out on the dunes again .
is he oh no .
ill go and look for him .
ill come with you . ill come too .
its your brother . johannes .
no anders .
anders so theres trouble with johannes again .
yes . id better go with them .
yes , i suppose so . poor fellow .
do you mean johannes .
yes . dont you think one should pity him 27 , and incurably mad .
i dont know . perhaps hes happy as he is .
you cant think that .
put on something warm .
yes , all right .
your fathers going , too .
yes . im ready now .
ill have some hot coffee for you .
yes , well need it .
woe unto you , hypocrites , .
unto you , and you , .
and you .
woe unto you for your lack of faith .
woe unto you who do not believe in me , the risen christ , .
who was sent to you by him who made the heavens and the earth .
verily i say unto you , the day of judgment is at hand .
god has summoned me to prophesy before his face .
woe unto him that does not believe , .
for only those who have faith shall enter .
into the kingdom of heaven .
is johannes .
yes .
what good does all this do , johannes .
i am the light of the world , .
but the darkness does not comprehend it .
i have come unto mine own , .
but mine own do not receive me .
what are the candles for .
that my light may shine in the darkness .
i feel sorry for him .
hes completely crazy .
oh , mikkel .
he goes around thinking hes jesus .
will he ever be sane again .
its all that studying that has turned his head .
yes .
he should never have been made to study .
i did it because he had a talent for it .
you wanted to have a parson in the family .
no , mikkel , thats not true , there are parsons enough .
what we need is someone who can shake people up .
with johanness special abilities i thought he might be the spark .
that could fire christendom again from this farm .
i prayed so earnestly that it be he , the prophet that should come .
the reformer .
the renewer , yes . i prayed so ardently for it .
but you see what has come of it .
well , i suppose wed better go back to bed . goodnight , father .
goodnight , my boy .
goodnight , father .
goodnight , anders .
ill just go and have a look at the sow .
johannes will be himself again .
ive hoped and hoped he might , but hell never get any better .
why dont you believe so .
miracles dont happen any more .
nothing is impossible , if one prays to him for it .
i have prayed and prayed and prayed , inger .
then you must go on praying , .
for jesus has promised what we pray to him for , he will give us .
i know , inger , i know . but what good have all my prayers done .
how do you know what your prayers may have set in motion .
pray , and go on praying , however little you feel it helps .
goodnight , little granddad .
goodnight , inger . i think ill sit here a little while longer .
yes , all right .
goodnight .
i feel so sorry for your father .
im sorry for johannes .
so am i , but .
but what .
johannes is perhaps closer to god than the rest of us , .
but your father .
i cant stand all his righteousness .
i think you are being unfair .
he has also been unfair to me .
he has never reproached you .
no , he kept quiet . but i could feel what he was thinking .
i saw the look in his eyes .
when i kept away from all the godliness here on the farm .
but mikkel , you believe in god , dont you .
you know how i feel about all that , inger .
that you have no faith .
not even faith in faith .
but you have something else , something more important .
and what is that .
a heart , goodness .
i tell you , its not enough to have faith .
if one is not a good person at the same time .
and thats what you are .
but i have no faith .
it will come .
are you sure of that .
yes . and then you will see how warm you will feel , .
a glow inside you and youll be so happy .
its nice to be happy , isnt it .
yes , inger girl and now we must sleep .
goodnight , little girl .
goodnight , big boy of mine .
karen , run out with that to the hens .
youll have to give me a bit of help .
with what .
well , you see , anne and i were thinking of .
anders you havent fallen in love with the tailors anne .
yes . is there anything wrong with that , mikkel .
you could have done much worse .
worse .
yes . i dont mean theres anything against her , .
shes a sweet girl .
but what .
what would father think .
thats where you two will have to help me , if you will , that is .
yes , but what about her father . what will he say about it .
you know , theyve got quite different ideas about religion .
we love each other , it doesnt make any difference .
yes , thats what we think too , mikkel and i , but .
but but what , eh mikkel .
im darned if i know .
listen now , will you help me or wont you .
of course well help you .
why dont you go over and have a word with annes father .
i dont think its any use talking to him .
give it a try anyway .
well yes , i suppose i could .
what do you think , inger .
yes , give it a try .
meanwhile , ill try to have a talk with your father .
that will be the most difficult part of it .
do you think so yes , but ill find a way .
thanks a lot , inger . im sure youll manage it somehow .
its your job to fix it up with the tailor .
so long ill go over right away .
goodbye and good luck .
i hope to goodness father wont blow up and get stubborn .
im most worried that hell be unhappy about it .
its time you went down to the reed bed .
i suppose so . so long , my girl .
one would think we just fell in love .
didnt we , darling .
weve been married for eight years .
mind youre not too clumsy .
am i usually .
no , certainly not .
dear god , please help me today .
its because it has rained through the roof .
its you why , granddad you scared me .
did i .
what was it you said .
i said , that patch up there its rain water . the roof leaks .
oh yes yes , thats what it is .
this confounded rheumatism .
whats all this coffee at this time of day .
its so cold today , granddad .
yes , yes . and homemade cakes you made them yourself .
youre so fond of them .
tell me , is this what you are looking for .
thanks ill have the long one today . but it needs filling .
it is filled .
can you also do that .
theres nothing i cant do .
except have sons .
now then here you are .
listen , granddad .
a corpse in the front living room .
whatever are you talking about .
johannes , be quiet and shut the door .
a corpse in the living room to the glory of my father in heaven .
now then , johannes , now then .
what on earth was he talking about .
who worries about what he says , inger .
wont you have another cup .
well , thanks , just a drop .
that was the new parson . he went into the church .
its funny he hasnt been here to see us yet .
hell come some time or other .
i suppose mikkel and anders are down at the reed bed .
yes . mikkel went just as you came .
his sermons are good enough .
who the parson .
yes , its just that it takes him too long to reach amen .
yes , perhaps . granddad .
wont you help me .
of course i will , if i can .
you can all right . there now .
you know anne , the tailors anne .
yes . what about her .
dont you think she would make a firstclass wife for anders .
is that why we are having coffee .
yes . well , no , it isnt , really . but dont you think she would .
i dont think well talk any more about that .
to think you set so much stock by that .
by what .
your peasants pride .
i think birds of a feather is best .
granddad , i think the most important thing .
is to love one another .
love comes with the years , inger .
little granddad , you understand everything in the world , .
except love .
now , now .
tell me , have you ever in your life been in love .
have i ever been in love at least ten times .
thats just what i thought .
thought what .
that you have never really been in love .
i have at any rate been married , so far as i know .
yes , that with you and maren , that was just .
just what .
a farmers agreement .
inger , maren was a good wife to me . just the wife i needed .
i beg your pardon , granddad .
granddad , if you promise me anders and anne .
can have each other , then ill promise you something .
that will make you really happy .
and what is that , may i ask .
you shall have fried eel for dinner on sunday .
thats what i call an offer .
and granddad , ill promise you this time it will be a boy .
does that make you happy .
you are quick to promise , inger .
then do you say yes .
inger , inger , you trouble yourself about many things .
youll see , anders will soon get that thought out of his head .
and well easily find the right girl , who will .
well then id better tell you how things are .
anders is not down at the reed bed with mikkel .
not at the reed bed no .
then where is he .
oh i see .
so , that was the reason we should have coffee .
yes , granddad , that was the reason . and when he gets back , .
well both of us say , congratulations . wont we .
so peter the tailor gets himself a soninlaw today .
and you get a daughterinlaw . a sweet , good and capable girl .
thats not what ive asked for .
granddad , say yes now .
after hes gone over there .
without saying anything to me about it .
and you , inger , you knew about it and never said a word .
its a conspiracy , a conspiracy of my own children .
behind my back .
no , im blessed if i will .
granddad , where are you going .
dont ask me . you dont tell me where you are going .
granddad , granddad .
and in his shirt sleeves .
youd better go in and get some coffee .
yes .
and tell hans to give the mare some straw .
here you are . what came over you , granddad .
borgens farm is not what it was .
of course it is .
johannes will never be any different .
how do you know that .
and mikkel will never be any different .
that you can name those two in the same breath .
whats wrong with mikkel , anyhow .
just this , that he has renounced the faith of his forefathers .
mikkel is good enough . he has god in his heart .
and now anders .
sometimes i just cant understand you .
you go about looking as though god has forsaken you .
do i .
yes , something has snapped inside me .
and you know what the reason is .
because god did not hear your prayers .
when you knelt by johanness bed .
no , inger , thats where you are wrong .
it was not gods fault , it was my own .
if i had had faith when i prayed , the miracle would have happened .
but i prayed only because i thought it was worth trying .
when a father cannot pray for his child with faith , .
then miracles do not happen .
dont you think god could do it just the same .
i dont believe it any longer .
do you know what i believe .
i believe a lot of little miracles happen secretly .
god hears peoples prayers , but he does it kind of secretly , .
so as not to have too much fuss made about it .
perhaps youre right .
i think ill go and meet maren and little inger .
they must be on the way home from school .
yes , it must be about time .
coming along .
you bet i am .
but the rheumatism .
i dont give a darn about the rheumatism .
im not quite a cripple yet .
peter petersen tailor .
the time is coming for me to go , i hear the voice of winter .
for i also am only a bird of passage .
my real home is elsewhere .
there you are , little anne . was there anybody at home .
yes .
did you get the money .
yes , ill put it away .
all right , my girl .
youre back , anne . can you let the hens out .
all right , mother . ill give them some water .
look here , anne .
it seems to me youve been crying .
did you meet anybody on the way .
yes , i met anders in the sand dunes .
anders from borgens farm .
did you talk with him .
yes . they got 15 piglets .
i hope you remembered what ive told you .
yes , father , i remember all right .
you know you must be on guard .
yes , father .
that sin does not get control of you .
thats a good girl .
anne , bring some firewood in with you .
all right , mother .
do you know what i was just thinking , kirstine .
no , peter .
it might not be such a bad thing , .
to be fatherinlaw to borgens farm .
then anne would never lack anything .
it wasnt the worldly advantages i was thinking of .
wasnt it .
no , i was looking further ahead .
what were you thinking of .
i was wondering if we small folk down here .
could not win over borgens farm for the kingdom of god .
that would be a wonderful thing .
makes you feel dizzy it did me , too .
but i came down to earth again .
how , peter .
i realized i was thinking .
more about the worldly than the heavenly advantages .
it was a blessing our lord opened your eyes .
yes . thanks and praise be to him .
pick up the scraps , so that nothing goes to waste .
come in .
good day . i happened to be passing by .
god be with you .
i beg your pardon .
you are perhaps .
you dont know me .
are you the son of the farm .
i am a bricklayer .
i build houses , .
but nobody will live in them .
wont they .
they like to build themselves .
they build themselves , even though they do not know how .
therefore some of them inhabit halffinished huts , .
others live in ruins , .
most of them wander about homeless .
are you one of those in need of a house .
i am the new minister . my name is .
my name is jesus of nazareth .
jesus . but how can you prove that .
thou man of faith , whose own self lacks faith .
people believe in the dead christ , but not in the living .
they believe in my miracles from 2000 years ago , .
but they dont believe in me now .
i have come again to bear witness .
to my father who is in heaven and to work miracles .
miracles no longer happen .
thus speaks my church on earth .
that church which has failed me , .
that has murdered me in my own name .
here i stand , and again you cast me out .
but woe unto you , if you nail me to the cross again .
thats absolutely appalling .
its you , anders .
yes . good day , peter .
what did you want something you want sewn .
no , its not that .
then what do you want .
well , you see anne and i , were fond of each other , .
and now ive come to ask you if i can have her hand .
and my answer is no . definitely no . .
why not call anne in and ask her .
no .
it would make no difference .
arent i good enough .
no , anders , you are not good enough .
whats wrong with me .
whats wrong with you is you are not a christian .
not a christian .
not what we here understand by christian .
i think im just as much a believer as you and kirstine .
thats possible but you are not of our faith , .
and that is what counts with me . now you had better go , .
were going to have a prayer meeting .
goodbye . my regards at home .
welcome in the name of the lord .
welcome . good day , welcome in the name of the lord .
its you welcome in the name of the lord .
come in and sit down .
good day , reverend . i am the eldest son of the farm , .
mikkel borgen .
are you good day . welcome to borgens farm .
wont you sit down .
im afraid theres no one at home . would you like a smoke .
no , thank you very much .
did you meet anybody .
yes , yes . i met , i believe , wasnt it your brother .
have you spoken to johannes .
i hope he wasnt unpleasant to you .
no , no . but was he born , well , a little .
yes , we dont talk much about it up here , but with you .
no . something happened .
was it a love affair .
no , no . it was soren kierkegaard .
in what way .
johannes studied theology . did he .
it went all right at first .
but then he had a difficult time with speculation and doubts .
and then it turned inward yes .
it must have been a terrible time for the family .
yes , one is so helpless , one wants to help , .
but there is nothing one can do .
here comes father , so wed better talk about something else .
good day , reverend . welcome to borgens farm .
good day . and welcome .
this is maren and little inger .
are there others besides these two .
not yet . but were expecting .
mikkel may i bring you a cup of coffee .
no , thank you . another time , perhaps . i have an appointment .
goodbye , reverend , and thank you for coming .
it was a pleasure . goodbye .
allow me .
run along and get something to eat .
he seems a pleasant sort of fellow .
thats what hes being paid for . has anders gotten back .
have you told father .
yes . you may as well know at once what your father has decided .
of course anders shall have a wife .
but he will have a wife of the same faith as we have .
father is afraid .
afraid .
afraid that annes faith is stronger than anders , .
so that peter can triumph over us .
inger , i believe you understand me .
when i took over the farm here , .
there wasnt a grain of living christianity in the whole parish .
i began one man against them all , .
in church they thundered against me , no one was on my side .
here from this farm the fight was waged all those years , .
until the farm had won the victory .
and now you ask me to open the doors of the farm .
to the sour holy crowd down by the village pond , .
who fought against me .
no , id sooner die first . can you understand me , inger .
yes , granddad , but i am thinking of anders .
i know anders . hes a good boy .
but hes weak and easily influenced , .
and therefore he should have a wife of his own faith .
and hes to give up the girl he loves .
mind what you say , mikkel .
you misunderstand your father , mikkel .
heaven , here he comes .
ah anders . have you been at the reed bed .
no , father , i was at .
yes , yes , from , yes , yes .
congratulations .
what is it are you bawling .
he said no , father , he said no . .
he turned me down .
who turned you down .
peter the tailor .
but anders .
did peter the tailor turn you down .
yes , immediately . then he threw me out .
is my son not allowed to have peter the tailors daughter .
and may i ask why .
because , because im not good enough .
why arent you good enough .
because i am not of their faith .
oh really so thats why we here at borgens farm , .
were not good enough for peter the tailor .
the devil were not we here at the farm are heathens .
id like to know if peter the tailor is brave enough .
to say that to my face .
anders , is it serious between you and anne .
would i have let him throw me out otherwise .
thats a sensible reply . inger , my jacket .

mikkel , harness up hans .
he was ready for you before .
yes , yes , thats right .

thanks . god knows who he thinks he is .
have you a clean handkerchief ah there it is .
you remember everything .
remember to keep an eye on the sow .
and one says the age of miracles is past .
i must go out and unload .
i must get the dishes done .
we are washed in the blood of the lamb , .
we know god performs his wonders among us still today .
is it not a great wonder , jenssigne , .
that you are sitting here in the knowledge of your salvation .
is it not a wonder , kristen thatcher , that god has seen fit .
to convert you and make you give yourself to him .
is it not a wonder that i , miserable sinner , .
stand here and bear witness amongst you is it not wonderful .
is it not glorious is it not a great blessing .
thanks and praise be to god .
good evening .
ah good evening . welcome to our meeting .
ive not come to attend your meeting .
ive come to have a word with you .
that you are also welcome to .
come in .
are you alone .
ive brought anders with me .
mette maren was just going to bear witness .
yes , maren , now we are assembled here again .
i just wanted to say i wish for each one of you .
that you may come to be on the same terms with god as i am .
while i still lived in sin , .
i was so cramped and pressed down by it , .
but then i saw the light , .
and now i am the happiest person in the world , .
and i praise and thank god and thats what i wanted to say .
that was a good confession .
sit down , wont you .
shall we sing hymn number 1 3 .
sinner , close your ears no more .
open for the voice of the lamb .
hark its voice is full of grace .
come and rest against my breast .
yes , number 82 .
god be with you .
hello yes , this is mikkel borgen again .
hasnt the doctor come back yet oh you have .
is that what he said then he should be here soon .
who .
the midwife , yes , shes come , .
but she doesnt dare anything until the doctor gets here .
yes , she has asked us to bring in a large table .
just a moment , theres a car coming now .
yes , its him , thank heavens .
yes , goodbye .
what yes , thanks very much .
its not going well with inger .
who says so .
the midwife .
well , lets see how bad it is .
think all of you .
come all of you .
gods judgement will be salvation to all .
good night , brothers and sisters .
well meet again , god willing , in a weeks time .
in the poor house in the name of jesus .
goodnight , my friend , goodnight .
good evening , anders . and welcome .
can you go out and light up the stove , little anne .
sit down beside your father .
good evening and welcome .
thank you , kirstine .
would you like some coffee .
all right .
will you fill your pipe .
well , i dont mind .
and anders .
no , thanks , not just now .
bacon prices are rising , peter .
yes , eggs fell yesterday .
have you many hens , peter .
about as many as you have pigs , i imagine .
ah theres the coffee .
isnt anne coming in .
i dont think so .
shed better not .
i think it makes it easier for her to go the lords way .
there , father , you hear .
then you can drink your coffee out in the kitchen .
all right . that is , if the if you think it best .
you can do it anyhow .
the three of us will drink in the kitchen , .
since youll decide things here .
look here , peter , on the way over .
ive tried to see things from your point of view .
and what did you come up with .
that theres no reason for our children to suffer because .
we two dont see eye to eye about religion .
anne shall have one of our own faith .
we have no intention of taking god from her .
its a waste of time talking about it .
you cant understand me .
what about you can you understand me .
i can understand you all right . ive been like you myself once .
but that was not enough for you .
you are right , borgen , it was not enough for me .
i wont say anything against you and the others .
but i cant stand you , im darned if i can .
what is it you cant stand about us .
first and foremost all your conversion rubbish .
and what else have you against us .
i cant stand your undertaker faces .
yes , ive heard that before .
no , you , you have the bright , happy christianity , .
while we , we are the dark of soul and undertakers .
but since you are one of the bright and happy christians , .
why do you always look so miserable when one meets you .
i feel so free and glad , .
because i know there is a place waiting for me in heaven .
and the rest of us , all the rest of us , .
we go straight down to hell to eternal torments , dont we .
yes , thats what you think , isnt it .
yes . words , words , you have them all right .
and the dead arose and began to speak , .
and he gave him to his mother .
would you like to see the picture .
its a lovely picture .
you can see better over here , anders .
is there any more coffee .
yes , peter .
you take it in , anne .
oh is it you , little anne , with the coffee pot .
do you think i should have some more , anne .
then just half a cup . isnt your mother in the kitchen .
yes , but anders is also there .
thank you , my girl , thank you .
well , peter , have you changed your mind .
what do you mean by that .
i mean about anne and anders .
no , i havent . not yet , anyhow .
not yet .
tell me , morten , do you feel completely content with your god .
yes , yes , of course i do .
do you now , morten .
what are you trying to get at , peter .
you are not content , morten . come over to us .
have you gone out of your mind .
then you would get peace in your soul .
morten , morten , dont say that .
when you are only dust returned to dust it will be too late .
come , come over to us .
ill be blessed if i do .
morten , morten , the lord is the god of miracles .
he has the power to redeem you from disbelief and delusions .
disbelief and .
disbelief and delusions .
you say that of my faith .
do you know what the difference is between your faith and mine .
you think christianity is sullenness and selftorment .
i think christianity is the fullness of life .
my faith is for all day long and joy in life .
yours is the longing for death .
my faith is the warmth of life . yours is the coldness of death .
one day you will realize , peter , that ours is the right way .
what is it really you are looking for .
we are looking for god and nothing else .
well , it all sounds very nice , but nevertheless .
we do not regard you as being either converted or believers , .
so in my opinion .
in your opinion .
you are all lost .
in the opinion of peter the tailor well all end in hell .
anders , anders .
yes , father .
we are going home .
but dont i get anne .
and i say yes , you shall have her , the devil strike me , .
you will have her , even if i myself .
have to drag her out of this prison house . come along .
we are going now .
and goodnight , peter the tailor .
morten . dont you see that the wrath of god is upon you .
i wont hear another word of that rubbish .
you wont hear me but you shall hear god .
you shall be tested still more .
hello yes , it is . what .
no , not yet .
yes , they are just leaving .
oh , really .
well , goodnight . i hope she soon gets better .
what is it what did you mean by hope she soon gets better .
truly we live in an age of miracles .
what do you mean by that .
just as i tell you you are to be tested still more , .
your son , mikkel , calls .
and what then .
and tells me that inger is dangerously ill .
inger then it must be the child .
no , it was something unusual , so far as i understood .
then i must hurry .
i earnestly hope that the lord will reach your heart this time , .
however hard he has to strike .
what is it you are saying god help me , .
i believe you actually hope my daughterinlaw will die .
yes . if there is no other way , .
then i hope it in the name of the lord .
you do , do you .
dont , morten , dont , i tell you .
do you know what the answer is to that .
no , dont this is the only answer .
father , control yourself .
there are witnesses . even if you are the mighty morten , .
others also have their rights .
go to hell .
i wont get in your way .
swine of a landowner .
are they labor pains .
inger .
you can get the anaesthetic .
yes , doctor .
borgen , will you hold the lamp .
what was that what has happened .
its nothing . she will come to shortly .
how is the pulse .
not too good .
remove the mask .
come give me a hand .
lets listen to the heartbeat .
its a bit rapid .
is the child alive .
yes , so far . but we must get it over with .
will she pull through .
you mustnt disturb me bring the lamp a bit closer .
now , put down the lamp and get me a pail .
how big like that .
hows it going .
karen , run out and get that little pail .
my wife bought last week .
i see the doctor is here . isnt the midwife .
they are both here .
is it the child .
its lying wrong .
and inger .
we must be thankful if her life can be saved .
is it serious , father .
were in for a busy night , anders .
yes , praying .
yes , father . both for anne and for inger .
for inger . anne , that will clear itself up .
go to bed now , and trust in god .
shouldnt we pray together , father .
little anders , when its really serious i pray best alone .
gods will be done .
then came our lord himself , with his scythe and his hourglass .
yes , johannes , yes .
why art thou afraid . oh thou of little faith .
i have not yet ascended unto my father .
keep quiet , johannes .
but in his native village he performed no great works , .
because they did not believe in him .
go to your room . go to bed .
well , mikkel .
the child has come .
was it a boy , as inger promised me .
yes . it was a boy .
there , you see , the lord does not fail .
hes lying there , in the pail , cut into four pieces .
oh mikkel , if only you could pray to god .
you can do that , father .
what are you doing now , johannes .
didnt you see him .
whom .
the lord .
with the hourglass and the scythe . he took the child away .
if you had believed in me , this would not have happened .
now i am powerless .
oh god oh god .
how great must your need be before you listen to me .
little johannes , if you want to do your old father a favor , .
go to your room .
look , look .
what shall i look at .
cant you see him hes standing there .
the man with the scythe , he has come back to fetch inger .
keep quiet , man .
you still do not heed me .
johannes no , no , this is madness and yet .
what is madness and what is reason .
you are drawing nearer to god , it will cost you but one word .
no , no , no go away .
you are seeking grapes on thorn bushes .
the vines you pass by .
go away , i tell you , or you will make me mad , too .
granddad .
what not in bed yet , little maren .
yes , i am .
you spoke so loud , granddad .
oh , did i wake you up .
yes , we have moved .
moved .
our beds have been put into your room . do you know why .
because we are expecting a little brother .
who has told you that .
mother .
were you pleased about that .
i would rather have had a little sister , .
but mother said she had promised you a little brother .
did she say that .
yes . and then just think , she goes and gets ill like this .
yes , so our lord has decided .
not to send the little brother just yet .
has he .
yes , and now you can go in .
and pray to god to make your mother better again .
yes , but he wont do that .
he wont .
no , shes going to die tonight .
whats that what did you say .
uncle johannes says so . and then hell call her back to life .
just like the man in the bible , you know .
what rubbish is this .
thats what uncle says .
oh well , .
but now youd better go and tuck yourself in bed , little maren .
yes , granddad .
goodnight , sweetheart .
goodnight , granddad .
i cant bear to be in there .
be strong , my boy .
i can see the way its going .
the way its going .
i wont bear to lose her .
you wont lose her , mikkel . god will . god will .
if inger dies .
will you promise me that you will live until .
anders and anne are married , so that the children have a home .
it must not happen . oh god dont take inger from us .
lets go in to her . ill come with you .
you are strong , old father .
yes but i am holding on to gods hand . come .
uncle , will mother die soon .
do you want her to , little girl .
yes , because then youll bring her back to life , wont you .
itll probably come to nothing .
the others wont allow me to .
then what about mother .
then mother will go to heaven .
but i dont like that at all .
little girl , .
you dont know what its like to have a mother in heaven .
is it better than having her here on earth .
you can see that for yourself .
but what nonsense .
if we get into trouble , we wont have a mother to look after us .
a child that has a mother in heaven doesnt get into trouble .
when ones mother is dead , she is always with you .
as she is when she is alive .
but then she has so many other things to think about .
yes , she has to milk and scrub the floors and wash up .
the dead dont have to do all that .
id rather have you awaken her , uncle .
would you .
yes , so that we could keep her .
child .
wont you awaken her .
if the others will allow me , i will .
dont you bother about the others .
how happy i am .
are you .
yes . will you come tuck me in .
yes , and i will let one of my fathers angels .
keep watch beside your bed tonight .
will you give us your blessings , as you usually do .
yes , i will .
and he took the little children .
to his bosom .
laid his hands upon them and blessed them .
god , do not send death to us .
look now , borgen .
dont say it , doctor .
its all over .
what no .
shes asleep , and with any luck there wont be any complications .
eternal thanks and praise .
yes , it was a tough job .
it certainly was , doctor . and many thanks .
and now we want lots of coffee .
yes , indeed , we certainly do .
karen , karen , we must have .
ingers getting better , shes getting over it .
we must have coffee , coffee , from real coffee beans .
doctor , may i go and have a look at her .
yes , if you are quiet about it .
very quiet .
good evening , reverend , and welcome again .
thank you , thank you .
do you know .
yes , i know both the doctor and his car .
that was what made me look in .
i wanted to hear what was happening .
good evening , doctor .
it was kind of you . you see , my sons wife she was , .
she had to .
yes , she was expecting , wasnt she .
the child died , but she pulled through .
i see .
now take off your coat , reverend .
theres some coffee coming in a minute , and then we .
thanks , but ive got to be getting home .
you can drive with with with the doctor .
yes , of course .
yes , sit down now . ill just take a peep in there .
shes sleeping like one of gods angels . here you are , doctor .
its like a miracle .
you must pardon me , my good borgen .
i dont want to hurt your religious feelings , .
but now that its turned out all right , allow me .
to tease you a little .
which do you think helped most this evening , .
your prayers or my treatment .
gods blessing , my dear doctor .
ora et labora , as the old monks used to say .
perhaps you believe in miracles , reverend .
believe naturally miracles are possible , since god .
is the creator of everything and everything .
is therefore possible to him , .
but but .
on the other hand , even though god can perform miracles , .
he does not do so . and why not .
because miracles would break the laws of nature , .
and naturally god does not break his own laws .
but what about the miracle of christ .
those were under special circumstances .
i see . that is to say under special circumstances .
your otherwise so reliable god can throw a hitch into the works .
come on , my good pastor .
thats the trouble with doctors .
they always believe in whats least worth believing .
there you go , doctor .
the lord be with you . the lord bless you and keep you .
the lord let the light of his countenance shine upon you .
and give you grace .
and give you peace . amen .
what was that .
that was johannes giving his blessing to the little children .
yes . you know , reverend well , you saw him , didnt you .
excuse me , but dont you think .
i mean , wouldnt he be better off in a home .
my boy stays here with me so long as i am at borgens farm .
johannes will get better all right .
do you think so .
just wait until he runs against a psychic shock , which .
will turn upside down that bag of tricks we call the subconscious .
you think he can be as he was before .
yes , just as he was before .
there you are , reverend , you see , .
the doctor also believes in miracles .
i believe in those miracles which my science has taught me .
god grant it may happen .
yes , we hope so , borgen .
ill have a look at the patient and then well be off .
im ready .
dear borgen , my heartiest congratulations .
thank you very much , reverend .
arent you grateful for what god has done for you here tonight .
you can be sure i am , reverend .
it has been a difficult time .
it certainly has . and yet i would not have missed it .
i can also understand that .
well , doctor .
shes sleeping as she should .
now you can just go to bed .
and the thanks of borgens farm for this nights work .
karen , send two geese over to the doctor at christmas .
i am not a vet they will die under my treatment .
coming along .
yes , yes . goodnight , borgen .
how is it going with inger .
well , anders , better than could have been expected .
there he is again , the man with the hourglass , .
he has come back to fetch inger .
johannes , go to your bed .
look , now hes going through the wall .
those are the doctors car lights .
inger is asleep now .
there is no longer any danger for her life .
listen its the scythe he missed his stroke .
that is the doctor , hes backing his car out .
stop , will you , come back , do you hear .
you must . he will not . then go .
in the hour of faith you will have to bring her back .
listen , now , johannes , thats enough of that .
now she is dead .
suddenly , she drifted away in her sleep .
inger dead youre lying . now you are lying .
its your nerves .
but the doctor was just in there with her .
come see for yourselves .
i felt her grow stiff in my arms .
i saw her lips turn blue and her eyes glaze over .
the lord gave and the lord hath taken away .
the lords name be praised .
shouldnt we call the doctor .
if you think he can deal with death , then call for him , anders .
no , he left from here a short time ago .
yes . will you tell him will you tell him that .
that she has just died inger .
thank you . goodbye .
she is not dead , she is sleeping .
do you think so would you like to see her sleeping .
show me where you have laid her .
if you have faith , you shall see the glory of god .
i , the christ , have come from god , .
and with god shall i remain .
among the clouds of heaven .
anders anders .
is he dead .
no , father , these are not the ones who die .
not even that much mercy has been granted us .
mikkel , my boy .
why did she have to die .
why should we be torn from each other .
it is all so meaningless , so meaningless .
mikkel , you know why .
what do i know i only know that .
everything i loved and worshipped .
is now to be buried in the earth to rot , to rot and rot .
death certificate: name: inger borgen , housewife .
date of death: 1 3 august 1 925 .
register of the parish of husby c.j . houen 8/1 4/1 925 .
yet a little while i am with you . ye shall seek me .
whither i go , ye cannot come st . john xiii . 33 .
my faithful wife and our beloved mother inger borgen born kjar .
has been taken from us mikkel borgen , .
maren , little inger .
our dearly beloved daughterinlaw and sisterinlaw .
inger borgen has gone to eternal rest in steadfast faith .
in her divine savior jesus christ , .
deeply missed by all at borgens farm .
morten borgen anders borgen .
but i say unto you which hear , love your enemies , .
do good to those who hate you . bless those who curse you , .
and pray for those who spitefully use you .
and unto him that smiteth thee on the one cheek .
offer him also the other .
it is time to go , if were going to get seats in church .
yes , kirstine .
do you remember when morten borgen came here .
i offended him greatly .
it seems to me it was morten borgen that offended .
thats possible , but my offense was greater .
kirstine , i should have turned the other cheek .
arent you a little hard on yourself .
no , remember the words of christ , what will you in church .
be reconciled to thy brother , then come and offer thy gift . .
well , wed better be going . we must call at borgens farm .
arent we going to church .
no , were going to the borgens farm . are you ready , anne .
inger borgen , born kjar .
born 24 january , 1896 died 1 3 august , 1 925 .
blessed be he that hath peace in his soul .
none knoweth the day , before the sun goeth down .
good morning , good morning , sings the bird on the bough .
it saw the evening sun behind the prison wall .
at dawn the flowers curtsied sweetscented .
by evening they lay crushed under a storm of hail .
small children played often in the red glow of morning .
by evening they lay on the coffin still and dead .
itll be a large procession , father .
the reverend will soon be here .
well have to let them finish .
with their coffeedrinking in there .
well , inger , we must put the lid over you .
mikkel father .
mikkel , let the parson say a prayer first .
yes , yes . well send her away with full honors .
ah here comes the parson . shall we let the spectators in .
mikkel , youll kill me .
all right . well wait .
good morning , borgen . there she is .
i suppose some good must come of it .
otherwise it would not have happened .
those were the words of faith .
good morning , borgen .
remember , mikkel borgen , .
that even in pain there is beauty .
yes . and all that beauty , doctor , .
its so frightfully important .
any news of johannes .
weve looked everywhere for him , .
no one has seen or heard anything of him .
then we must be prepared for the worst .
god grant he may have found peace .
shall i let them in .
may i say a few words .
death is the gateway to eternity , and the young woman , .
who lies here has passed through , before her dear ones .
we are mourning because we think of our grief and loss , .
for truly there is no need to mourn on her behalf .
therefore , be grateful for your memories , .
your bright , happy memories , .
of the days that have passed by , and the bright hope .
you have for her in the life that is to come .
to you , mikkel borgen , i would say , if you can live your life .
in the memory of her , and can bring up your children , .
so that she would be glad if she could see it , .
then you two , who loved one another , .
shall again be reunited , never to be separated again .
shall we say the lords prayer in silence .
thank you , reverend , for your kind words .
no need to thank me .
father , look .
peter , have you come here .
you must forgive me for intruding on you , morten borgen .
will you take my hand .
but it was i who struck you .
it was i who forgot the words of our savior .
i have prayed to him for forgiveness .
you must do the same , morten .
it is all so unimportant now .
no , it is not , for i have something to say here , .
beside this coffin , something you must all know .
before inger is carried away .
i know you mean well , peter , but enough has been said here .
im coming to what i have to say .
that ingers place shall not stand empty .
anne , come here .
is anne with you , peter .
here she is .
only god can reward you for this .
now she belongs to you all .
anne .
now i have only my savior left , and him i shall never give up .
oh peter , it warms my heart .
be gentle with her up here .
you shall be the sunshine in all our lives , anne .
thank you , anders .
oh thank god , now the tears have come .
karen , come .
now well come to the end .
goodbye , inger .
thank you for everything , for everything was good .
we shall soon meet again . yes , mikkel , theres another meeting .
goodbye , inger . god rest your soul .
say goodbye to your mother .
goodbye , mother .
she doesnt understand any of this . she is too little .
and the rest of us , we dont understand any of it either .
that is so true , borgen .
goodbye , inger and thank you .
anders , the lid .
no , you must not take her . you must not separate us .
no mikkel , no .
there now , mikkel , her soul is with god .
it is not here , you can see that .
her body is here . i loved her body also .
be strong , say your goodbye . you are a son of borgens farm .
goodbye , little sweetheart .
goodbye , my little girl .
father you say , father your eyes are as they were before .
you have found your wits again , johannes .
yes , i have found my wits again .
not one of you has had the idea .
of asking god to give inger back to you again .
johannes , now you are blaspheming god .
no , all of you blaspheme god with your lukewarm faith .
if you had prayed to god , hed have listened to your prayers .
what is all this .
standing here and shouting over my wifes dead body .
my brother .
why is there not one among these believers who believe .
inger , you must rot , because the times are rotten .
put the lid on .
hurry , now , uncle .
the child .
the greatest in the kingdom of heaven .
hurry up now .
do you believe i can do it .
yes , uncle .
thy faith is great , thy will shall be done .
look now at your mother .
when i say the name of jesus she will arise .
hear me , thou who art dead .
hes crazy .
is it crazy to wish to rescue life .
trust in god .
jesus christ , if it is possible , .
then give her leave to come back to life , give me the word , .
the word that can make the dead come to life .
inger , .
in the name of jesus christ , i bid thee .
arise .
little inger girl .
morten , it is the god of old .
the god of elijah , eternal and the same .
yes , eternal and the same .
is it alive .
yes , inger .
it lives at home with god .
with god .
yes , inger . i have found your faith .
now life begins for us .
life , yes .
life .
i still dont know why im here . couldnt you just make them say yes .
yes , i could , but its not my way .
and i would expect you , of all people , would understand my feelings on misuse of power .
ah , power corrupts and all that . yes , i know , charles .
when are you going to stop lecturing me when you start listening .
youre here because i need you .
we dont have to meet every one of them in person .
no . this ones special .

yeah , the brochure is great .
but what about jean what about her illness .

jean , can you come down , dear .
well leave you , then .
its very rude to read my thoughts , or mr . lensherrs , without our permission .
did you think you were the only one of your kind , young lady .
were mutants , jean . were like you .
really i doubt that .
oh , charles .
i like this one .

logan . oh , dont get your panties in a bunch .
that was my last cigar .
logan .
its getting closer . come on . lets keep moving .
hey , tin man . come here .
hows your throwing arm logan , we work as a team .
yeah . good luck with that . throw me . now .
dammit , logan , dont do this .
class dismissed .
hey , colossus . nice throw .
simulation complete .
what was that danger room session .
you know what i mean . lighten up .
you cant change the rules . im trying to teach em something .
i taught em something . it was a defensive exercise .
yeah , best defense is a good offence . or is it the other way round .
this isnt a game , logan . well , you sure fooled me .
hey , im just a sub . you got a problem , talk to scott .
scott jean .
scott . scott .
scott .
are you ok im fine .
you seem like youre avoiding me . somethings wrong .
i cant touch my boyfriend without killing him . other than that im wonderful .
hey . i dont think thats fair . have i ever put any pressure on you .
youre a guy , bobby . your minds only on one thing .
they were looking for you . you didnt show . what do you care .
for starters , i had to cover your ass . i didnt ask you to .
no , you didnt . the professor did .
i was just passing through . so pass through , logan .
hey , look .
i know how you feel . when jean died dont .
maybe its time for us to move on .
not everybody heals as fast as you , logan .
mr . secretary . yes .
the meetings begun , sir . thank you .
mr . president .
have a seat , hank .
homeland security was tracking magneto .
we got hits in lisbon , geneva , montreal .
navsat lost him crossing the border , but we did get a consolation prize .
we picked her up breaking into the fda .
you know who shes been imitating secretary trask here .
yes , sir . she can do that .
not any more , she cant . we got her . you think your prisons can hold her .
we have some new prisons . well keep them mobile . be a step ahead .
where is magneto .
raven .
raven , i asked you a question . i dont answer to my slave name .
raven darkholme . thats your real name , isnt it .
or has he convinced you you dont have a family any more .
my family tried to kill me , you pathetic meat sack .
ok , then . mystique where is he .
in here with us .
i dont want to play games with you . i want answers .
you dont want to play games with me .
you are going to stop this . tell me , where is magneto .
you wanna know where he is .
homo sapien .
you know , her capture will only provoke magneto , .
but having her does give us some diplomatic leverage .
on principle , i cant negotiate with these people .
i thought thats why you appointed me , sir . yes , it is .
but thats not why you called me here . no . this is .
its what she stole from the fda .
dear lord .
is it viable we believe it is .
you realize the impact thisll have on the mutant community .
yes . i do . thats precisely why we need some of your diplomacy now .
when an individual acquires great power , .
the use or misuse of that power is everything .
will it be for the greater good or will it be used for personal or for destructive ends .
now , this is a question we must all ask ourselves .
why because we are mutants .
for psychics , this presents a particular problem .
when is it acceptable to use our power and when do we cross that invisible line .
that turns us into tyrants over our fellow man .
but einstein said that ethics are an exclusive human concern .
without any superhuman authority behind it .
einstein wasnt a mutant so far as we know .
this case study was sent to me by a colleague , dr . moira mctaggert . jones .
the man you see here was born with no higherlevel brain functions .
his organs and nervous system work , but he has no consciousness to speak of .
what if we were to transfer the consciousness of one person , .
say a father of four with terminal cancer , .
into the body of this man .
how are we to decide what falls within the range of ethical behavior and what .
professor .
well continue this tomorrow . class dismissed .
the forecast was for sunny skies .
i dont have to be psychic to see that somethings bothering you .
i dont understand . magnetos a fugitive , .
weve a mutant in the cabinet , a president who understands us why hide .
were not hiding . but we still have enemies . i must protect my students . you know that .
yes , but we cant be students forever .
storm , i havent thought of you as my student for years .
in fact , i thought that perhaps you might take my place some day .
but scotts scotts a changed man .
he took jeans death so hard .
yes , things are better out there , .
but you , of all people , know how fast the weather can change .
theres something youre not telling us .
hank .
ororo . charles .
i love what youve done with your hair .
you too . thank you for seeing me on such short notice .
henry , you are always welcome here . youre a part of this place .
i have news . is it eric .
no . though we have been making some progress on that front .
mystique was recently apprehended . whos the fur ball .
hank mccoy . secretary of mutant affairs .
right , right . the secretary . nice suit .
henry , this is logan . hes wolverine .
i hear youre quite an animal . look whos talking .
magnetos gonna come get mystique .
magnetos not the problem . at least not our most pressing one .
a major pharmaceutical company has developed a mutant antibody .
a way to suppress the mutant x gene .
suppress permanently .
theyre calling it a cure .
thats ridiculous . you cant cure being a mutant .
scientifically speaking when did we become a disease .
storm .
theyre announcing it now .
these socalled mutants are people just like us .
their affliction is nothing more than a disease , .
a corruption of healthy cellular activity .
but i stand here today to tell you that theres hope .
this site , once the worlds most famous prison , .
will now be the source of freedom for all mutants who choose it .
i proudly present the answer to mutation .
finally , we have a cure .
who would want this cure i mean , what kind of coward would take it just to fit in .
is it cowardice to save oneself from persecution .
not all of us can fit in so easily .
you dont shed on the furniture . the government probably cooked this up .
the government had nothing to do with it . ive heard that before .
my boy , i have been fighting for mutant rights since before you had claws .
did he just call me boy is it true they can cure us .
yes , rogue . it appears to be true .
no . professor .
they cant cure us .
you wanna know why because theres nothing to cure . nothings wrong with you .
or any of us , for that matter .
how should we , as mutants , respond heres what i think .
this is about getting organized . bringing our complaints to the right people .
we need to put together a committee and talk to the government .
they dont understand . they dont know what it means to be a mutant .
we need to show them , educate them , let them know that were here to stay .
people , you must listen . they wont take us seriously .
they wanna exterminate us . this cure is voluntary .
nobody is talking about extermination .
no one ever talks about it .
they just do it .
and youll go on with your lives ignoring the signs all around you .
and then one day , when the air is still and the night has fallen , they come for you .
then you realize , while youre talking about organizing and committees , .
the extermination has already begun .
make no mistake , my brothers . they will draw first blood .
they will force their cure upon us .
the only question is , will you join my brotherhood and fight .
or wait for the inevitable genocide .
who will you stand with the humans .
or us .
you talk pretty tough for a guy in a cape .
back off .
if youre so proud of being a mutant , wheres your mark .
i have been marked once , my dear . let me assure you .
no needle shall ever touch my skin again .
you know who youre talking to .
and what can you do .
so you have talents .
that and more . i know you control metal .
and i know theres 87 mutants in here , none above a class three .
other than you two .
you can sense other mutants and their powers .
could you locate one for me .
let me out of here . i demand that you release me .
do you know who i am im the president of the united states .
oh , mr . president .
why are you doing this to me let me down . ill be a good girl . please let me go .
keep it up . ill spray you in the face , bitch .
when i get out of here , im going to kill you myself .
yeah , right .
secretary mccoy , welcome to worthington labs .
thank you , dr . rao . not an easy place to get to .
its the safest location we could find . thats why we keep the source of the cure here .
he is a mutant . you understand our concern .
we are in compliance with your policy . how long will you keep the boy here .
until we can fully map his dna . we can replicate it , but we cant generate it .
and his power what is its range .
youll see .
jimmy .
theres someone i would like you to meet .
hello there , son .
hi . my name is hank mccoy .
its ok .
you have an amazing gift . thank you , jimmy .
extraordinary , isnt he .
yes , he is .
can you hear me im still here . scott . stop .
im here . scott . scott . stop it .
scott . scott . stop it .
i need you , scott . scott . scott .
jean .
how .
i wanna see your eyes .
take these off . no .
trust me . i can control it now .
open them . you cant hurt me .
what happened no clue .
professor , are you ok get to alkali lake .
you dont want to be here . do you .
i cant see a damn thing .
i can take care of that .
the sheer mass of water that collapsed on top of jean should have obliterated her .
the only explanation of jeans survival .
is that her powers wrapped her in a cocoon of telekinetic energy .
is she gonna be ok .
jean grey is the only class five mutant ive ever encountered , her potential limitless .
her mutation is seated in the unconscious part of her mind and therein lay the danger .
when she was a girl , i created a series of psychic barriers .
to isolate her powers from her conscious mind .
jean developed a dual personality . what .
the conscious jean , whose powers were always in her control , and the dormant side .
a personality that , in our sessions , came to call itself the phoenix .
a purely instinctual creature , all desire and joy and rage .
she knew all this its unclear how much she knew .
far more critical is whether the woman in front of us is the jean grey we know , .
or the phoenix furiously struggling to be free .
she looks peaceful to me . im keeping her that way .
im trying to restore the psychic blocks and cage the beast again .
what have you done to her .
you have to understand youre talking about a persons mind .
she has to be controlled . controlled .
sometimes , when you cage the beast , the beast gets angry .
you have no idea . you have no idea of what she is capable .
no , professor . i had no idea what you were capable of .
i had a terrible choice to make . i chose the lesser of two evils .
it sounds to me like jean had no choice at all .
i dont have to explain myself , least of all to you .
history will be made here today . for the first time , .
the socalled mutant cure will be available to the public .
reaction has run the gamut with mutants on both sides of the line .
some are desperate for this cure while others are offended by the very idea of it .
will secretary mccoy be a problem .
hard to say . his political views seem somewhat at odds with his personal issues .
excuse me , sir . your sons arrived .
good . bring him in .
are you sure you want to start with him .
i think its important . yes .
hello , warren . how are you , son .
did you sleep well yeah .
you know , im proud of you for doing this .
everythings gonna be fine . i promise .
you ready .
the transformation can be a little jarring .
dad , can we talk about this for a second weve talked about it , son .
itll all be over soon .
everythings going to be fine . wait . i cant do this .
warren , calm down .
i cant do this . yes , you can .
i cant do this . just relax , son . take it easy . calm down .
i promise you it will be fine . warren , relax . dad .
warren , its a better life .
its what we all want . no .
its what you want .
warren , no .
told you so .
about time .
ive been busy . did you find what you were looking for .
the source of the cure is a mutant . a child at worthington labs .
without him , they have nothing .
read off the guest list .
cell 41205 . james madrox .
this one robbed seven banks .
at the same time . i could use a man of your talents .
im in . welcome to the brotherhood .
careful with this one . cain marko . solitary confinement .
check this out . prisoner must be confined at all times .
if he builds any momentum , no object can stop him .
how fascinating .
what do they call you juggernaut .
i cant imagine why . are you going to let me out i need a pee .
nice helmet . keeps my face pretty .
i think hell make a fine addition to our army .
you saved me .
eric .
youre not one of us any more .
such a shame . she was so beautiful .
think resigning will make a difference thats no way to influence policy .
policy is being made without me , mr . president .
the decision to turn the cure into a weapon was made without me .
what happened on that convoy was inexcusable . but your actions .
that was an isolated incident . you have to understand those mutants were a real threat .
have you even begun to think what a slippery slope youre on .
i have .
and i worry about how democracy survives when one man can move cities with his mind .
as do i .
you and i know that its only going to get worse .
all the more reason why i need to be where i belong .
hi , logan . welcome back .
back where we first met . only i was in your place and you were in mine .
more than ok .
logan , youre making me blush .
youre reading my thoughts i dont have to .
wait . no .
this isnt you . yes , it is me .
no . maybe you ought to take it easy .
the professor said you might be different .
he would know , wouldnt he .
what you think hes not in your head too .
look at you , logan . hes tamed you .
wheres scott .
where am i youre in the mansion .
you need to tell me what happened to scott .
jean , tell me what happened to him .
oh , god .
look at me .
stay with me . talk to me .
look at me . look at me . no .
focus . focus , jean .
kill me .
what kill me before i kill someone else .
dont say that . please .
stop it . kill me .
stop it . look at me . look at me . jean .
itll be all right . we can help you .
hey . the professor can help . he can fix it .
i dont want to fix it .
voluntary they put the cure in a gun .
i told you they would draw first blood .
so what do we do what do we do .
we use this weapon as a lightning rod to bring countless more to our cause .
come . we have an army to build .
i picked something up .
an electromagnetic force . its massive .
its a mutant .
class five . more powerful than anything ive ever felt .
more powerful than you .
jean . jean . what happened .
what have you done .
i think she killed scott . what .
thats not possible . i warned you .
shes left the mansion , but shes trying to block my thoughts . shes so strong .
it may be too late .
wait for me here . what .
i need to see jean alone .
you were right , charles .
this one is special . what the hell are you doing here .
same as the professor . visiting an old friend .
i dont want trouble here . nor do i .
so , shall we go inside .
i came to bring jean home . dont interfere .
just like old times , eh she needs help . jean is not well .
funny , you sound just like her parents .
nobody gets inside .
i knew youd come . of course . ive come to bring you home .
i have no home . yes , you do . you have a home and a family .
you know he thinks your power is too great for you to control .
i dont believe your mind games are going to work any more , charles .
so you want to control me he does .
no . i want to help you .
help me whats wrong with me .
absolutely nothing . eric , stop .
no , charles , not this time . youve always held her back .
for your own good , jean .
stay out of my head .
im going in . the professor said hed handle this .
look at me , jean . i can help you . look at me .
perhaps you should listen to her , charles . trust me . youre a danger to everyone .
but i can help you . i think you want to give her the cure .
look at scott . you killed the man you loved because you couldnt control your power .
no stop it .
jean , let me in .
no , jean .
dont let it control you .
charles .
my dear . come with me .
god .
we live in an age of darkness .
a world full of fear , hate and intolerance .
but in every age , there are those who fight against it .
charles xavier was born to a world divided .
a world he tried to heal .
a mission he never saw accomplished .
it seems the destiny of great men to see their goals unfulfilled .
charles was more than a leader , more than a teacher . he was a friend .
when we were afraid , he gave us strength .
and when we were alone , he gave us a family .
he may be gone , but his teachings live on through us , his students .
wherever we may go , we must carry on his vision .
and thats a vision of a world united .
kitty .
you ok yeah .
its just xavier came to my house .
he was the one that convinced me to come here .
yeah , me too .
were all feeling the same way , you know . no , bobby , were not .
you have rogue and i have .
you know , i just miss home .
the first snow and all that .
kitty , get up . come with me . storm told us to stay in our rooms .
dont worry . we wont get caught .
i mean , you can walk through walls , you know .
this place can be home too .
thank you for this , bobby .
you need a lift , kid .
where are you going .
you dont know what its like to be afraid of your powers , afraid to get close to anybody .
yeah , i do .
i want to be able to touch people , logan .
a hug . a handshake .
a kiss .
i hope youre not doing this for some boy .
look , if you wanna go , then go .
just be sure its what you want .
shouldnt you be telling me to stay .
to go upstairs and unpack .
im not your father . im your friend .
just think about what i said , rogue .
remember when we first met do you know what i saw when i looked at you .
i saw the next stage in evolution both charles and i dreamt of finding .
and i thought to myself , why would charles want to turn this goddess into a mortal .
i can manipulate the metal in this , .
but you , you can do anything .
anything you can think of .
enough .
you sound just like him .
jean , he wanted to hold you back .
what do you want i want you to be what you are .
as nature intended .
that cure is meant for all of us . if we want freedom , we must fight for it .
and that fight begins now .
she shouldnt be here with us .
her power is completely unstable . only in the wrong hands .
and you trust her shes one of them . so were you once .
i stuck with you . would have killed the professor if youd given me the chance .
charles xavier did more for mutants than youll ever know .
my single greatest regret is that he had to die for our dream to live .
so what now what do we do .
xavier started this school . perhaps its best that it end with him .
well tell the students theyre going home . most of us dont have anywhere to go .
i cant believe this . i cant believe were not going to fight for this school .
im sorry . i know this is a bad time .
i was told that this was a safe place for mutants .
it was , son .
and it still is . well find you a room .
hank , tell all the students the school stays open .
rogue .
hey , rogue .
hey , pete . have you seen rogue yeah , she took off .
logan . jean .
logan . where am i logan .
logan . logan .
logan . stop .
logan . logan . logan .
where are you going where do you think .
shes gone , logan . shes not coming back . you dont know that .
she killed the professor .
it wasnt jean . the jean i know is still in there .
listen , why cant you see the truth .
why cant you just let her go because because .
because you love her .
she made her choice . now its time we make ours .
so if youre with us , then be with us .
we dont need a cure we dont need a cure .
getting the cure so you can go back home to mommy and daddy .
im looking for someone .
oh , i get it . your girlfriend .
i figured shed want the cure . shes pathetic .
come on , iceman .
make a move .
same old bobby . still afraid of a fight .
todays attack was only our first salvo .
so long as the cure exists , our war will rage .
your cities will not be safe . your streets will not be safe . you will not be safe .
and to my fellow mutants , i make you this offer .
join us or stay out of our way .
enough mutant blood has been spilled already .
were trying to track them , sir . were working hard .
we cannot let him do this . you know i agree , sir .
this is now a national security matter . seize and secure worthington labs .
i want troops armed with cure weapons deployed immediately .
and trask , you have to find magneto and stop him by any means necessary .
magneto wants a war . well give him one .
lets go . keep it moving .
turn in your old weapon . turn in all metal .
bayonets , magazines , dog tags .
pick up your plastic weapons . pick up your cure cartridge .
absolutely no metal .
they wish to cure us . but i say to you we are the cure .
the cure for that infirm , imperfect condition called homo sapiens .
they have their weapons .
we have ours .
we will strike with a vengeance and a fury that this world has never witnessed .
and if any mutants stand in our way , we will use this poison against them .
we shall go to alcatraz island , .
take control of the cure , .
and destroy its source .
and then nothing can stop us .
i know the smell of your domatium from a mile away .
i didnt come here to fight you . smart boy .
i came for jean . you think im keeping her against her will .
shes here because she wants to be . you dont know what youre dealing with .
i know full well . i saw what she did to charles .
and you stood there and let him die .
im not leaving here without her . yes , you are .
two minutes till rendezvous , mr . president .
we have a satellite feed of magnetos base of operations .
how did we find it she gave us everything we wanted .
hell hath no fury like a woman scorned .
approaching target dead ahead .
set for 360degree incursion .
this is team leader to bravo one . we are green to go .
ok , send them in .
freeze , mutants get your hands in the air hands in the air .
ok . i give up .
sorry , mr . secretary , it was a decoy .
if hes not there , then where the hell is he .
worthington labs . it ends where it began .
are you sure the boy is still inside 100% .
so how are we supposed to get there cause i dont swim .
leave that to me .
storm . storm .
what are you doing back here .
i need help .
you found her . yeah . shes with magneto .
where are they on the move . i know where theyre going .
youre saying you saw magneto we gotta go . theyre gonna attack alcatraz .
there are troops stationed on that island . not enough to stop him .
lets suit up .
hard to believe this once fit me . if magneto gets that cure , we cant stop him .
can you estimate how many he has an army . and jean .
his powers have limits , hers do not . theres only six of us , logan .
yeah . were outnumbered .
im not gonna lie to you .
but we lost scott .
we lost the professor .
if we dont fight now , everything they stood for will die with them .
im not gonna let that happen .
are you .
then we stand together .
xmen .
all of us .
were in .
theyre ready . yeah , i know .
but are you ready to do what you need to do when the time comes .
dad , whats going on .
its an earthquake .
were trapped .
charles always wanted to build bridges .
fall back take cover fall back .
the boys in the southeast corner of the building .
well , then . lets take it down .
in chess , the pawns go first .
humans and their guns .
plastic . theyve learned .
thats why the pawns go first .
target the bridge .
arclight , use your shockwaves . target those weapons .
oh , my stars and garters . go into stealth mode .
what about jets tanks against magneto hell turn them inside out .
where are our ground troops 30 minutes away .
then god help us .
theyre coming for him .
dont ever do that again .
you men cover the doors .
everybody get together and hold this line .
traitors to their own cause .
finish them .
go inside and get the boy . and kill him .
with pleasure .
hes going for the boy .
not if i get there first .
grow those back .
dont you know who i am .
im the juggernaut , bitch .
going somewhere .
youre the guy that invented the cure , right .
yes , i am .
no . dont . dont hurt him .
no . dont hurt him . let go of me . i didnt do anything .
calm down . calm down .
i thought you were a diplomat . as churchill said , there comes a time .
oh , you get the point .
oh , no . please , no , no , dont .
no , dont worry . im here to help you . im going to get you out of here .

lets go , lets go . move .
go go go .
we work as a team .
best defense is a good offence .
bobby , think you can take out your old friend .
go ahead .
storm , were gonna need some cover .

maybe you should go back to school .
you never should have left .
this is it .
make it a strike .
you never learn , do you .

one of them .
this is what they want for all of us .
its over , jean .

good to see you , buddy .
with the thanks of a grateful nation .

good evening , police inspection .
i�m just driving to zurich , err i�m not speaking frenchdo you understand english english yes .
.i firmly resolve , with the help of thy grace , to confess my sins .
to do penance , and to amend my life .
it seems you�re not a driver at all .
apparently , you lost your tongue along with your truck .
you think you�re in pain now , andre vernet .
my cause is worth your life . understand .
what do you want .
your truck carries a homing device . activate it .
yes the truck signal is comming online .
it�s about time .
locked on and tracking , sir .
very good . tell collet not to move in until i get there .
attention all of collet�s units .
to chateau villette .
the suspects neveu and langdon are likely at that location .
fache says to wait , so i wait .
what�s fache thinking the truck is here . they�re inside .
tell me where it is .
you and your brethren possess what is not rightfully yours .
i dont know what you are talking about .
is it a secret you will die for .
please . as you wish .
my god , forgive me .
in the sacristy .
the church of saintsulpice , is the rose line .
beneath the rose .
symbols are a language that can help us understand our past .
as the saying goes , a picture says a thousand words .
but which words .
interpret for me , please , this symbol . first thing that comes to mind .
hatred , racism . ku klux klan .
yes , yes , interesting . but they would disagree with you in spain .
there , they are robes worn by priests .
now this symbol . anyone .
evil .
in english , please .
devils pitchfork .
poor , poor poseidon .
that is his trident . a symbol of power to millions of the ancients .
now this symbol .
madonna and child . faith . christianity .
no . no , its the pagan god horus and his mother , isis .
centuries before the birth of christ .
understanding our past determines actively .
so how do we sift truth from belief .
how do we write our own histories , personally or culturally .
and thereby define ourselves .
how do we penetrate years , centuries , of historical distortion .
tonight , this will be our quest .
my son is a student of yours at harvard .
michael culp he adores you . oh , yeah .
he says youre the best teacher hes ever had .
ms . culp , i think i already gave michael an aminus .
he told me . thank you .
mr . langdon .
bonjour , professor .
im lieutenant collet from dcpj . a kind of french fbi .
will you take a look at this photo , please .
my police chief , capitaine fache , had hoped .
considering your expertise and the markings on the body .
you might assist us .
will you excuse me a moment .
i was supposed to have drinks with him .
yes , we know .
we found your name in his daily planner .
he never showed . i waited for over an hour .
why would someone do this to him .
oh , you misunderstand , professor .
he was shot , yes .
but what you see in the photograph .
monsieur sauni�re did to himself .
teacher , all four are dead .
the s�n�chaux and the grand master himself .
then i assume you have the location .
confirmed by all .
independently .
i had feared the priorys penchant for secrecy might prevail .
the prospect of death is strong motivation .
it is here .
in paris , teacher .
it hides beneath the rose in saintsulpice .
you will go forth , silas .
i chastise my body .
capitaine fache is waiting for you .
okay .
mr . langdon . yes .
im captain bezu fache .
you like our pyramid .
its magnificent .
a scar on the face of paris .
after me , please .
its the pairing of those two pyramids .
its unique .
the two are geometric echoes .
fascinating .
im not sure how much help im gonna be here this evening .
how well did you know the curator .
not very well .
frankly , i was surprised when he contacted me .
could we take the stairs .
so sauni�re requested tonights meeting .
how did he call you .
e mail . he heard i was in paris .
had something to discuss .
you seem uncomfortable .
the grand gallery . this is where you found the body .
how would you know that .
i recognize the parquet floor from the polaroid . its unmistakable .
lets cover the talking points again , your eminence .
many call opus dei a brainwashing cult .
others , an ultraconservative christian secret society .
obviously , some people fear what they dont understand .
perhaps a less defensive tack , your eminence .
the press continue to be harsh with us .
we are not cafeteria catholics .
we dont pick and choose which rules to follow .
we follow doctrine . rigorously .
does doctrine necessarily include vows of chastity , tithing .
and atonement for sins through selfflagellation and the cilice .
many of our followers are married . many of them have families .
only a small proportion choose to live ascetic lives .
why are some media referring that will be all , michael , thank you .
aringarosa .
silas has succeeded . the legend is true .
it hides beneath the rose .
my part of our bargain is nearly fulfilled .
i meet the council in an hour .
i will have your money tonight , teacher .
the vitruvian man .
its one of leonardo da vincis most famous sketches .
and the star on his skin .
a pentacle .
and its meaning .
the pentacle is a pagan religious icon .
devil worship .
no . no , no , no . the pentacle before that .
this is a symbol for venus .
it represents the female half of all things .
you are telling me that sauni�res last act on earth .
was to draw a goddess symbol on his chest why .
captain fache , obviously i cant tell you why .
i can tell you he , as well as anyone , knows the meaning of this symbol .
and it has nothing to do with worshiping the devil .
is that so yes .
then .
what do you make of this .
o , draconian devil . oh , lame saint . .
its a phrase . doesnt mean anything , not to me .
what would you do if you had such limited time to send a message .
well , i suppose id try to identify my killer .
so , professor .
officer neveu .
please , pardon the interruption .
this is not the time .
i received the crimescene jpegs at headquarters .
and ive deciphered the code .
its a fibonacci sequence .
thats the code sauni�re left on the floor .
headquarters sent me to explain , captain .
it is the fibonacci sequence .
the numbers are out of order .
but before that , i have an urgent message for professor langdon .
im sophie neveu , french police , cryptology .
your embassy called division .
im sorry , monsieur , they said it was a matter of life and death .
this is the number of your embassys messaging service .
hello , youve reached the home of sophie neveu .
miss neveu this .
no . thats the right number .
you have to dial an access code to pick up your messages .
but im getting .
its a threedigit code . its on the paper i gave you .
professor langdon , do not react to this message .
you must follow my directions very closely and , above all .
reveal nothing to captain fache .
you are in grave danger .
church of saintsulpice .
good evening , sister .
i need you to show someone our church tonight .
of course , father .
but so late .
wouldnt tomorrow .
this is a request from an important bishop of opus dei .
it would be my pleasure .
theres been an accident . a friend .
i have to fly home in the morning .
is there a restroom i could use i just wanna splash some water on my face .
she said it is meaningless .
mathematical joke .
is it meaningless .
ill take another look when i come back .
im sorry . of course .
do you have a message from sauni�re .
what are you talking about .
crazy old man .
you have me confused with someone else . i came here to .
check your jacket pocket .
gps tracking dot .
accurate within two feet anywhere on the globe .
the agent who picked you up slipped it into your jacket .
in case you tried to run .
why would i try to run i didnt do anything .
so , what do you think about the fourth line of text .
fache wiped clean before you arrived .
hes still in there whats he doing .
fache isnt even looking for other suspects , okay .
he is sure youre guilty .
when did sauni�re contact you .
today yes , yes .
what time what time .
at 3 . around 3 . three .
we call fache the bull . once he starts , he doesnt stop .
he can arrest you and detain you for months while he builds a case .
and by then whatever sauni�re wanted you to tell me will be useless .
stop it just stop .
who are you .
look at the letters .
p.s .
p.s . , postscript .
princesse sophie . silly , i know .
but i was only a girl when i lived with him .
jacques sauni�re was my grandfather .
apparently , it was his dying wish that we meet .
if you help me understand why .
i will get you to your embassy , where we cannot arrest you .
fache was never gonna let me just stroll out of here , was he .
if we are to get away from here , we must find another way .
what exactly do you propose .
sauni�re was reading his book .
excuse me , captain .
we have a problem .
headquarters didnt send sophie neveu .
captain , look at this .
he jumped .
hes moving again . and fast .
he must be in a car .
hes going south on pont du carrousel .
bastard .
that cop will check the whole lower floor .
i will only take a moment .
he is much older than i remember .
i hadnt seen or spoken to him in a very long time .
he phoned my office today . several times .
he said it was a matter of life and death .
i thought it was another trick to get back in touch .
it seems when he couldnt speak to me .
he reached out to you .
wait a minute . professor .
this is wrong . yeah . see this is wrong .
the fibonacci numbers only make sense when theyre in order .
these are scrambled .
if he was trying to reach out , maybe he was doing it in code .
would you hold this , please .
this phrase is meaningless .
unless you assume these letters are out of order too .
an anagram .
you have eidetic memory .
not quite . but i can pretty much remember what i see .
anagram is right .
o , draconian devil . oh , lame saint becomes: .
leonardo da vinci . the mona lisa . .
professor , the mona lisa is right over here .
look at this . he must have thrown it from the window .
smart to hit the truck .
what , you admire him now .
were stupid . who did we leave at the museum .
ledoux get him on the radio .
her smile is in the lower spatial frequencies .
the horizon is significantly lower on the left than it is on the right .
well , see , she appears larger from the left than on the right .
historically , the left was female , the right was male .
there . blood .
so dark the con of man . .
no . it doesnt say that .
is it another anagram can you break it .
professor , hurry . hurry .
moon . sermon . charms .
demons . omens . codes . monks . ranks . rocks .
madonna of the rocks .
da vinci .
careful . careful .
this cant be this . the fleurdelis .
it was sauni�res .
i remember finding it once when i was a girl .
hed promised hed give it to me one day .
have you ever heard those words before , sophie .
no . have you .
when you were a child , were you aware of any secret gatherings .
anything ritualistic in nature .
meetings your grandfather wouldve wanted k ept secret .
was there ever any talk of something called the priory of sion .
the what why are you asking these things .
the priory of sion is a myth .
one of the worlds oldest and most secret societies , with leaders like .
sir isaac newton , da vinci himself .
the fleurdelis is their crest .
theyre guardians of a secret they supposedly refer to .
but what secret .
the priory of sion protects the source of gods power on earth .
i cant do this by myself .
im in enough trouble as it is . thats my embassy .
even if we could get out of this .
okay .
no , no , no . youre not gonna make it . youre not gonna make it .
well , that was .
we need to get out of sight .
christ , give me strength .
you are a ghost .
stealing in a house of god .
you have powerful friends .
bishop aringarosa has been kind to me .
i could not miss this chance to pray inside the saintsulpice .
a pity you couldnt wait for morning .
the light is not ideal .
tell me , sister , please , of the rose line .
a rose line is any line that goes from the north to south poles .
set into the streets of paris , 135 brass markers .
mark the worlds first prime meridian .
which passed through this very church .
sister .
i do not want to keep you . i will show myself out .
may the peace of the lord be with you .
and with you .
they found neveus car abandoned at the train station .
and two tickets to brussels paid for with langdons credit card .
a decoy , im sure .
all the same , send an officer to the station .
question all the taxi drivers . ill put this on the wire .
interpol were not sure hes guilty .
i know hes guilty . beyond a doubt .
robert langdon is guilty .
this is the bois de boulogne .
we should be safe in this park for a few minutes .
stay here .
what do you want .
fifty euros for all your stuff .
go and get something to eat .
did it occur to you that could be dangerous .
no . and now we have a place to think .
any ideas , professor .
you couldve just handed me a piece of a ufo from area 51 .
whats the next step .
with him , its always: .
sophie , whats the next step .
puzzles .
codes .
a treasure hunt .
to find his killer .
maybe there is something about this priory of sion .
i hope not .
any priory story ends in bloodshed . they were butchered by the church .
it all started over a thousand years ago when a french king .
this crusade , one of the most massive and sweeping in history .
was actually orchestrated by a secret brotherhood .
the priory of sion .
and their military arm , the knights templar .
but the templars were created to protect the holy land .
that was a cover to hide their true goal , according to this myth .
supposedly the invasion was to find an artefact .
lost since the time of christ .
an artefact , it was said , the church would kill to possess .
did they find it , this buried treasure .
put it this way: .
one day the templars simply stopped searching .
they quit the holy land and travelled directly to rome .
whether they blackmailed the papacy .
or the church bought their silence , no one knows .
but it is a fact the papacy declared these priory knights .
these knights templar , of limitless power .
by the 1300s , the templars had grown too powerful .
too threatening .
so the vatican issued secret orders .
to be opened simultaneously all across europe .
the pope had declared the knights templar satan worshipers .
and said god had charged him with cleansing the earth of these heretics .
the plan went off like clockwork .
the templars were all but exterminated .
the date was october 13th , 1307 . a friday .
friday the 13th .
the pope sent troops to claim the priorys treasure .
but they found nothing .
the few surviving knights of the priory had vanished .
and the search for their sacred artefact began again .
what artefact ive never heard about any of this .
yes , you have .
almost everyone on earth has .
you just know it as the holy grail .
please , sauni�re thought he knew the location of the holy grail .
maybe more than that .
this cross and the flower , this could be very old . but look .
this metal here underneath is much newer , and theres a modern id stamp .
haxo 24 .
and these dots . these dots are read by a laser .
this is more than a pendant . this is a key your grandfather left you .
he left us , professor .
and vingtquatre haxo , its not an id stamp .
its a street address .
this is jacques sauni�re .
please leave a message after the tone .
please , monsieur sauni�re , pick up the phone .
this is sandrine bieil .
i have called the list .
i fear the other guardians are dead .
the lie has been told .
the floor panel has been broken .
please , monsieur , pick up the phone . i beg you .
job 38 , verse 11 .
do you know it , sister .
hitherto shalt thou come .
but no further .
do you mock me .
where is the keystone .
you are a sister of the church .
and yet you serve them: the priory .
jesus had but one true message . that .
come , you saints of god .
hasten , angels of the lord .
to receive her soul .
and bring her to the sight of the almighty .
welcome , bishop .
this council is convened .
our words shall never pass these walls .
what business , say you .
as you know , my request for funds .
yes , 20 million euro in untraceable bearer bonds .
a tad more than petty cash . wouldnt you say , bishop .
i only offer a route to the renewal of faith for all men .
how humble .
our saviour , bishop aringarosa .
how dare you presume to .
i do not presume , i act .
the vaticans unwillingness to support us .
is both impious and cowardly .
blood is being spilled because true christian values lie in ruins . no more .
this council has forgotten its very purpose .
tonight .
the grail will be destroyed .
the priorys few remaining members will be silenced .
i was contacted by a man who calls himself only the teacher . .
two prostitutes identified langdon and neveu .
getting into a taxi in the bois de boulogne .
because of your expertise .
im sorry about the priory .
do you think thats why sauni�re sought you out .
i can think of dozens of scholars who know a lot more about it .
actually , i didnt think he liked me very much .
once made a joke at my expense . got a big laugh out of it .
what was it .
how may i help you .
the door to the right , please .
good evening . i am andr� vernet , the night manager .
i take it this is your first visit to our establishment .
understood .
keys are often passed on and firsttime users .
are sometimes uncertain of protocol .
keys are essentially numbered swiss accounts .
often willed through generations .
is it yours , mademoiselle .
the shortest safetydepositbox lease is 50 years .
and whats your longest account .
quite a bit longer .
technologies change , keys are updated .
once the computer confirms your key .
enter your account number and your box is retrieved .
the room is yours , as long as you like .
what if i lost track of my account number .
how might i recover it .
im afraid each key is paired with a 10digit number .
known only to the account bearer .
i hope you manage to remember it .
a single wrong entry disables the system .
ten . ten .
your grandfathers fibonacci sequence .
scrambled , unscrambled .
unscrambled .
its your key .
funny , i dont even like history .
ive never seen much good come from looking to the past .
moment of truth .
my god . i dont believe this .
a rose .
the rose was a symbol for the holy grail .
forgive the intrusion .
im afraid the police arrived more quickly than i anticipated .
you must follow me , please .
for your own safety .
you knew they were coming .
my guard alerted me to your status when you arrived .
yours is one of our oldest and highestlevel accounts .
it includes a safepassage clause .
safe passage .
if you would step inside , please . time is of the essence .
in there .
hey , is there a problem .
good evening , sir . police .
i just drive from here to zurich . not french , english .
english yes .
we are looking for two criminals .
you came to the right place . theyre all criminals here .
would you mind opening the hold .
please . you think they trust us , the wages i get paid .
you dont have keys to your own truck .
its armoured . keys get sent to the destination .
you mind im on a schedule here .
and do all the drivers wear a rolex .
this piece of shit .
forty euros in barb�s .
yours for 35 .
no , no , no .
thirty . no . its okay , its okay .
come on , 30 , eh .
i said , no .
now we wait .
the teacher will call and tell me where to deliver the money .
you have put tremendous faith in this teacher of yours .
yes , i have . and i have given him an angel to do his will .
for surely there is no better soldier for god than my silas .
i firmly resolve , with the help of thy grace , to confess my sins .
to do penance and to amend my life .
the holy grail .
a magic cup . the source of gods power on earth .
its nonsense .
you dont believe in god .
just people .
sometimes that they can be kind .
are you a godfearing man , professor .
i was raised a catholic .
well , thats not really an answer .
professor , are you okay .
go ahead , open it .
a cryptex .
they are used to keep secrets .
its da vincis design .
you write the information on a papyrus scroll .
which is then rolled around a thin glass vial of vinegar .
if you force it open , the vial breaks .
vinegar dissolves papyrus .
and your secret is lost forever .
the only way to access the information .
is to spell out the password .
with these five dials , each with 26 letters .
thats 12 million possibilities .
ive never met a girl who knew that much about a cryptex .
sauni�re made one for me once .
my grandfather gave me a wagon .
this clearly is not the holy grail .
please , youre not all right .
may i try something .
i dont know why it works .
my mother used to do it when i was scared , i think .
you think .
feeling better , sophie .
my parents died in a car crash with my brother .
i was 4 .
it was many years ago .
twenty years waiting for someone to come for that box .
and now its you two murderers . bring it to me .
i dont know what youre talking about .
all right okay .
right now .
step back .
no one will lose sleep over a couple on a killing spree .
turn around .
you too , mademoiselle .
sophie .
get in the truck .
ill drive hurry .
what happened between you and your grandfather , exactly .
ive jammed my shoulder , ive been shot at , im bleeding .
i need to know .
you say he raised you , but you two dont talk anymore .
you call him by his last name .
you say you hate history .
nobody hates history . they hate their own histories .
so now youre a psychologist too .
what if sauni�re had started to groom you for the priory .
what do you mean , groom me .
your grandfather gave you puzzles and cryptex as a child .
so you are saying all this is real the priory , the holy grail .
weve been dragged into a world of people who think this stuff is real .
real enough to kill for . who .
im out of my field here .
i do know a grail historian , absolutely obsessed with priory myth .
an englishman , lives here in france .
do you trust this man .
i hope you can .
vernet , andr� .
it seems youre not a driver at all .
apparently , you lost your tongue along with your truck .
you think youre in pain now , andr� vernet .
my cause is worth your life . understand .
your truck carries a homing device . activate it .
please wait . ill see if hes available .
its on the wrong side .
leigh likes all things to be english , including his cars .
robert do i owe you money .
leigh , my friend .
care to open up for an old colleague .
of course . thank you .
but first , a test of honour .
three questions .
fire away .
your first . .
shall i serve coffee or tea .
tea , of course .
second . milk or lemon .
milk .
that would depend on the tea .
and now the third and most grave of inquiries . .
in which year did a harvard sculler outrow an oxford man at henley .
surely such a travesty has never occurred .
your heart is true .
you may pass .
welcome to ch�teau villette .
the trucks signal is coming online .
its about time .
locked on and tracking , sir .
very good . tell collet not to move in until i get there .
attention all of collets units to ch�teau villette .
the suspects neveu and langdon are lik ely at that location .
aringarosa .
i still dont know why he put you into this .
and im sorry .
but .
im also very glad .
you are requested to make yourself at home .
robert .
and you travel with a maiden , it seems .
sir leigh teabing , may i present miss sophie neveu .
sophie , sir leigh teabing .
its an honour to welcome you .
even though its late .
thank you for having us . i realize its quite late .
so late , mademoiselle , its almost early .
what a lovely smile you have .
earl grey .
lemon .
ch�teau villette . yes .
a dramatic latenight arrival .
what can an old cripple do for you , robert .
we wanna talk about the priory of sion .
the keepers .
the secret war .
sorry for all the mystery .
leigh , im into something here that i cannot understand .
really not without your help .
playing to my vanity , robert . you should be ashamed .
not if it works .
there are always four: .
the grand master and the three s�n�chaux .
make up the primary guardians of the grail .
thank you , remy . thatll be all for now .
the priorys members span our very globe itself .
philippe de ch�risey exposed that as a hoax in 1967 .
and that is what they want you to believe .
the priory is charged with a single task: .
to protect the greatest secret in modern history .
the source of gods power on earth .
no , thats a common misunderstanding .
the priory protects the source of the churchs power on earth: .
i dont understand .
what power some magic dishes .
robert . has he been telling you that the holy grail is a cup .
the good book did not arrive by facsimile from heaven .
the bible as we know it was finally presided over by one man: .
the pagan emperor constantine .
i thought constantine was a christian .
oh , hardly , no . he was a lifelong pagan .
who was baptized on his deathbed .
constantine was romes supreme holy man .
from time immemorial .
his people had worshiped a balance between natures male deities .
but a growing religious turmoil was gripping rome .
three centuries earlier .
a young jew named jesus had come along .
preaching love and a single god .
centuries after his crucifixion .
and had started a religious war against the pagans .
or did the pagans commence war against the christians .
leigh , we cant be sure who began the atrocities in that period .
we can at least agree that the conflict grew to such proportions .
that it threatened to tear rome in two .
so constantine may have been a lifelong pagan .
and in 325 anno domini .
he decided to unify rome under a single religion , christianity .
christianity was on the rise . he didnt want his empire torn apart .
and to strengthen this new christian tradition .
constantine held a famous ecumenical gathering .
known as the council of nicaea .
and at this council .
the many sects of christianity debated and v oted on , well .
everything , from the acceptance and rejection of specific gospels .
to the date for easter .
to the administering of the sacraments , and of course .
the immortality of jesus .
i dont follow .
well , ma ch�re , until that moment in history .
jesus was viewed by many of his followers as a mighty prophet .
as a great and powerful man , but a man nevertheless .
a mortal man .
not the son of god .
not even his nephew twice removed .
constantine did not create jesus divinity .
he simply sanctioned an already widely held idea .
semantics . no , its not semantics .
youre interpreting facts to support your own conclusions .
fact: for many christians , jesus was mortal one day and divine the next .
for some christians , his divinity was enhanced .
absurd . there was a formal announcement of his promotion .
they couldnt even agree on the nicene creed .
excuse me . who is god , who is man .
how many have been murdered over this question .
as long as there has been a one true god .
there has been killing in his name .
now let me show you the grail .
i trust you recognize the last supper .
the great fresco by leonardo da vinci .
now , my dear , if you would close your eyes .
oh , leigh , save us the parlour tricks .
you asked for my help , i recall .
allow an old man his indulgences .
now , mademoiselle , where is jesus sitting .
in the middle . good .
he and his disciples are breaking bread .
and what drink .
wine . they drank wine .
splendid . and one final question: .
how many wineglasses are there on the table .
one the holy grail .
open your eyes .
no single cup .
no chalice .
well , thats a bit strange , isnt it .
considering both the bible and standard grail legend .
celebrate this moment as the definitive arrival of the holy grail .
now , robert , you could be of help to us .
if youd be so kind as to show us the symbols for man and woman , please .
no balloon animals . i can make a great duck .
this is the original icon for male . its a rudimentary phallus .
quite to the point . yes , indeed .
this is known as the blade .
it represents aggression and manhood .
its a symbol still used today in modern military uniforms .
yes , the more penises you have , the higher your rank . boys will be boys .
now , as you would imagine , the female symbol is its exact opposite .
this is called the chalice .
and the chalice resembles a cup or vessel or , more importantly .
the shape of a womans womb .
no , the grail has never been a cup .
it is quite literally this ancient symbol of womanhood .
and in this case , a woman who carried a secret so powerful .
that if revealed , it would devastate the very foundations of christianity .
wait , please .
youre saying the holy grail is a person a woman .
and it turns out , she makes an appearance right there .
but they are all men .
what about that figure on the right hand of our lord .
flowing red hair .
folded feminine hands .
hint of a bosom . no .
its called scotoma . the mind sees what it chooses to see .
my dear , thats mary magdalene .
the prostitute .
she was no such thing .
smeared by the church in 591 anno domini , poor dear .
mary magdalene was jesus wife .
this is an old wives tale .
the original one , in fact .
theres virtually no empirical proof .
he knows as well as i do theres much evidence to support it .
theories . there are theories .
notice how jesus and mary are clothed .
mirror images of each other .
the mind sees what it chooses to see .
and venturing into the even more bizarre , notice how jesus and mary .
appear to be joined at the hip and are leaning away from each other .
as if to create a shape in the negative space between them .
leonardo gives us the chalice .
yes . oh , and robert , notice what happens .
when these two figures change position .
just because da vinci painted it doesnt make it true .
no . but history .
she does make it true .
now , listen to this . its from the gospel according to philip .
yes , it was rejected at the council of nicaea .
along with any other gospels that made .
and the companion of the saviour is mary magdalene .
christ loved her more than all the disciples .
and used to kiss her on the .
but this says nothing of marriage .
well , actually .
actually , in those days , the word companion literally meant spouse . .
and this is from the gospel of mary magdalene herself .
she wrote a gospel she may have .
robert , will you fight fair she may have .
and peter said , did he prefer her to us .
and levi answered: .
peter , i see you contending against a woman like an adversary .
if the saviour made her worthy , who are you , indeed , to reject her .
yes . and then , my dear , jesus goes on to tell mary magdalene .
that its up to her to continue his church .
mary magdalene , not peter .
the church was supposed to be carried on by a woman .
few realize that mary was descended from kings , just as her husband was .
now , my dear , the word in french for holy grail .
from the middle english sangreal .
of the original arthurian legend .
now , as two words . can you translate for our friend .
sang real , it means royal blood . .
when the legend speaks of the chalice that held the blood of christ .
it speaks in fact of the female womb that carried jesus royal bloodline .
but how could christ have a bloodline , unless .
mary was pregnant at the time of the crucifixion .
for her own safety and for that of christs unborn child .
she fled the holy land and came to france .
and here , it is said , she gave birth to a daughter , sarah .
they know the childs name .
a little girl . yes .
if that were true , its adding insult to injury .
the pagans found transcendence through the joining of male to female .
people found god through sex .
in paganism , women were worshiped as a route to heaven .
but the modern church has a monopoly on that .
in salvation through jesus christ .
and he who keeps the keys to heaven rules the world .
women , then , are a huge threat to the church .
the catholic inquisition soon publishes .
the malleus maleficarum .
the witches hammer .
it instructed the clergy on how to locate , torture and kill .
all freethinking women .
in three centuries of witch hunts .
50 , 000 women are captured , burned alive at the stak e .
oh , at least that . some say millions .
imagine , then , robert .
that christs throne might live on in a female child .
you asked what would be worth killing for .
witness the greatest coverup in human history .
this is the secret that the priory of sion .
they are the guardians of the royal bloodline .
the keepers of the proof of our true past .
they are the protectors of the living descendants of jesus christ .
and mary magdalene .
sir leigh .
sometimes i wonder who is serving whom .
his sauces are not that fantastic .
yes , can i help you .
yes . theyre on the news now .
living descendants is it possible .
its not impossible .
you have not been honest with me . your pictures are on the television .
you are wanted for four murders .
thats why vernet said killing spree . .
you come into my home , playing on my passions for the grail .
thats why he needed you . you will leave my house .
leigh , listen no , im calling the police .
jacques sauni�re was her grandfather .
youre the obsessive priory scholar .
you still keep lists of who might be in the priory .
ill bet jacques sauni�re was on one of those lists .
he was on your list of who could be grand master , wasnt he .
what ill bet he was right at the top .
consider: four men murdered the same number as the guardians .
what if the priory was compromised , the other s�n�chaux dead .
what if you yourself were dying , a grand master .
youd have to pass the secret on to someone you could trust .
someone outside the society .
maybe someone whose training you had begun but never finished .
robert , your ruse is pathetic .
not really .
no , thats impossible .
can that really .
is it the keystone .
ill even show it to you , leigh .
will you just tell us what the hell its for .
fache says to wait , so i wait .
whats fache thinking the truck is here . theyre inside .
as the legend foretold: .
it hides beneath the rose . .
leigh .
im sorry . yes , of course .
inside the keystone .
therell be a map .
a map that will lead us to the holy grail .
to be trained by the grand master himself .
did he pass down the fleurdelis is that how you found this .
and he must have sung you the riddle songs .
i know some of them .
can you keep secrets .
can you know a thing and never say it again .
and codes .
i imagine they lie down for you like lovers .
a s�n�chal . a guardian of the grail right here in my own home .
tell him , please . i dont know any of this .
leigh , its not that simple . she doesnt rem .
do not move , woman .
cripple .
put the box on the table .
what , this trifle .
well , perhaps we can make a financial arrangement .
put the keystone on the table .
you will not succeed .
only the worthy can unlock the stone .
rip the gate down .
well , well , my dear .
are you okay yeah , yeah .
are you yeah .
yes , well , make yourself useful , you french fool .
get something to restrain this monster .
above the joint .
fortunately , a dragon most easy to slay .
hes wearing a cilice .
a what well , look .
inflicts pain so he can suffer as christ suffered .
opus dei .
fache is opus dei .
the policeman whos chasing us . he wears the cross in the world .
well , i must say , you two are anything but dull .
you want whats in this box .
we need a way out of here .
well , actually .
i do have a plane .
robert where do we go come along .
in here . come in . over here .
get the door . hurry .
over here . over here . sophie .
oh boy , my fears .
well , lets see . i never really was comfortable with being alone .
then all those other girls , they were so jealous of the fact .
that they had to worry about what they wore at school .
as if their parents cared .
when youre in the public eye , beauty rules . you ladies know that .
oh , no , no , no .
there is definitely no mister right .
and i sort of .
wanted that attention . but you know , from my dad .
not my real dad , he died , but my stepfather .
but i wasnt quite sure how to get it but .
i was passive , you know , and i think thats my worst nightmare .
being passive , so yeah .
i was a rebel in high school .
always had like a little brastrap showing . the black lipstick . god .
i liked the attention walking down the sidewalk , all those eyes on me .
but if a guy tried to talk to me , i was like whoa so out of there .
i cant help it if people are hooked on beauty .
ever since my dad died , my real dad . i either sleep with the tv on , .
or the lights on .
sometimes i tell myself stories . that kind of stuff . i hate the dark .
where am i .
please please .

every interviewers asked me anything you can imagine .
what are you afraid of if you have to choose .
between pink and orange whats your idea of hell .
you always give them the answers .
its flirtation , sometimes you tell them the truth , sometimes you dont .
but even your idea of hell .
i didnt tell them that .
let me guess .
isolation .
its okay , look at me .
how did he get you .
i got suckered into going to this charity event at a club in soho .
someone mustve put something in my drink .
that fucker .
i needed some fresh air , there was a hand on my shoulder , .
leading me outside . and then a damp cloth .
the last thing i remember was thinking .
that i hope hes not smearing my eye makeup all over .
i was driving from nebraska to connecticut . i got tired , .
so i pulled into a truck stop . i woke up , .
cause i thought i heard the sound of someone crying .
i got out to see what the hell was going on . and then , wham .
you see that .
last thing i remember .
was the smell of french fries from the allnight diner at the stop .
coffees lukewarm . what were you doing , consulting a psychic .
i was gettin my mac on brother .
mac on .
doin my thing . what the fuck is this .
did you fuck with my phone .
you need to take better care of your toys , man .
hey , did you get shit about that model whats her name .

and .
ive got 3 teams on it . were making progress .
dont forget the caterers . get back to me .

youre on a beach . in hawaii .
oh yeah , the waters blue .
if youre in here .
i knew you were going to do this to me too .
you know ive never been .
comfortable with the dark . i dont like being in the dark .
its always been a phobia .
when you go on safari , just nature is so awesome , dont you think .
it was sort of scary too at the same time , even though i loved it .
all that space just freaked me out .
is this what you want .
he cut my hair . why would he do that .
hes cleaning things up , he comes in when he wants to and checks us .
was he taking blood samples .
hey , you listening to me , wherever you are .
whats the point of antagonizing him .
you got a better idea .
lets give this guy a show whatever he wants .
whatever the fuck that is .
why take blood samples and cut my hair off .
i dont know , for a dna maybe .
dna , what does he want to do , clone us .
hes a mad scientist , how would i know .
forget it , this isnt going anywhere .
so what do you do .
when youre not trapped in a wine cellar .
i sleep in other peoples cars .
when people want to drive their cars .
from one coast to the other , but they dont have the time to drive , .
they use me . i have the time . i drive .
its a job .
it is .
excuse me , if celebrity is a job , so is driving another persons car .
i get why i was kidnapped .
you have a value , and i dont .
im not saying that its not messed up , but the reality is .
reality is without guys like me to drive your cars , youd be walking .
and if there wasnt guys like me , there wouldnt be .
anyone to pay guys like you , would there .
you live in this little bubble and you look down .
on the people who live in the real world .

will you get this thing outta my face come on .
hes using the video as a weapon against her . what do we know so far .
he kills in april .
he leaves the ashes of his last victim .
next to his current victim .
along with a quote on a tarot card .
locked in ritual .
poetry on tarot cards . in english , in greek .
hes not giving you guys any clues . hes fuckin with you .
this type of killer .
subconsciously wants to get caught .
thats the real reason they go to the press , leave clues .

its our heartsong , miss . thank you , gloria . excellent , yes .
without our heartsong , we cant be truly penguin , can we .
but , my dears , its not something that i can actually teach you .
does anybody know why anyone anyone .

because we have to find our heartsongs all by ourselves .
its the voice you hear inside .

oh , okay .
who is that .
that is the offspring of memphis and norma jean .
the wee hippityhopper .
its not funny .
no . no , not in the least .
a penguin without a heartsong is hardly a penguin at all .
i think he broke my ear .
in all my years , ive never , i mean .
and you having such fine voices . well , its bizarre .
did anything happen , you know , during early development .
no , all fine . normal incubation .
right . wasnt it , honey .
yeah . yeah , it was a tough winter , i guess .
he did hatch a little late yes , i understand . yes .
he did hatch a little late yes , i understand . yes .
to think he might spend his life alone quite , quite .
never to meet his one true love .
oh , please , miss viola , isnt there something we can do .
well , there is always mrs . astrakhan .
if anyone can , mrs . astrakhan can .
if anyone can , mrs . astrakhan can .
cant sing .
cant sing rubbish , darling .
every little penguin has a song .
when i have finished .
your singing will be giving everyone the goose pimple .

you get them singing muscles big and strong , you got that .
you bet you will . the word triumph starts with try , and it ends with .
umph . thats right . a great big umph . .
im going fishing .
that first hard summer .
while his mom and dad were working overtime .
on the great commute to the sea .
mumble found a place away from disapproving eyes .
where a funky little fella could be himself .
hey , what you doing there , flipper bird .

ask me how i know . how .
because ive been captured by them , thats how .
what do you mean unbelievable its true .
im sitting on a rock , minding my own business .
when suddenly , theyre onto me .
these beings , like big ugly penguins .
fat , flabby faces with frontways eyes .
no feathers , no beaks , and these these appendages .
they probe me . they tie me up . they strap me down .
they take this pointy thing and they stick it into me .
and then , blackout .
i woke up and theres this this thing on me .
every flying bird is dissing me , hey , whats happening , yellow leg .
it was humiliating .
it was humiliating . what more do you want .

the kid saw out his school days at the back of the class .
lost in his imaginings .
now its dark and im .
what fabulous worlds lay out there , far beyond the ice .
i wont be afraid .
was there any place .
where one small penguin without a heartsong .
could ever truly belong .
and so , a thousand generations ago .
our forefathers forsook our wings for flippers .
you graduates going to sea for the first time .

this was an omen from the start and now we have this uprising .
stop stop .
stop this unruly nonsense .
stop it right now .
a little selfcontrol , if you please .
you bring this disorder , this aberration , to the very heart of our community .
have you lost your minds .
were just having fun . harmless fun .
harmless it is this kind of backsliding that has brought the scarcity upon us .
excuse me , smiley . can you speak plain penguin , please .
he thinks the food shortage has something to do with me .
do you not understand that we can only survive here when were in harmony .
when you and your foreign friends lead us into your easy ways .
you offend the great guin .
you invite him to withhold his bounty .
he rules the seasons . he giveth and he can taketh away .
wait a minute . happy feet cant cause a famine .
if thy kind of pagan display did not cause it , then what did .
i think it comes from outside . way beyond the ice .
there are things out there , things we dont understand .
mysteries . mindboggling mysteries .
mystic beings . yeah , aliens .
hes mad . no , aliens .
i hear theyre smart . hes insane .
no , they might be smarter than all of us . who knows .
he drove the fish away , now hes ranting this rubbish .
hey , let me tell something to you . dont touch me , you filthy vermin .
hey , watch it . and so it follows .
dissent leads to division and division leads us to doom .
you , mumble happy feet , must go . hear , hear .
dont you take one step , sweetheart .
you have as much right to be here as any of these daffy old fools .
norma jean , ill deal with this .
mumble , you must renounce your socalled friends .
your peculiar thoughts , your strange ways .
memphis . if we are devout .
sincere in our praise , the fish will return .
but , pa listen , boy , i was a backslider myself .
i was careless and now were paying the price .
whats this got to do with mumble .
its why he is the way he is . theres nothing wrong with him .
face it , our sons all messed up . hes not messed up , hear me .
believe me , i know . how can you say that .
because when he was just an egg , i dropped him .
oh , my poor little mumble .
but , mom , im perfectly fine .
no . no , youre not , boy . thats right .
for all our sakes , you must stop this freakiness with the feet .
your father speaks wisely . heed his suffering heart and repent .
but it just doesnt make any sense .
then your arrogance leaves us no choice .
no , wait .
please , son , you can do this . it aint so hard .
dont ask me to change , pa , because i cant .
and that , my brethren , is the end of it .
you , begone .
mumble . no , ma , its okay . its okay .
let me tell something to you .
when i find out whats happening to the fish .
let me through let me through .
mumble , you dont have to go . let it be .
gloria . no . no , dad , this isnt fair .
gloria , listen to your father .
my folks were always putting him down .
down , down , down .
they said he came from the wrong side of town .
he came from the wrong side of town .
they told me he was bad .
but i know he was sad so sad .
but i know he was sad so sad .
ill never forget him the leader of the pack .
we sing the heart of our true friend , mumble .
together , we prevail .
in the wisdoms , we trust .
we trust .
look out .
dont worry , tall guy . my father also called me a pitiful loser .

my photograph .
yeah . well , from when i was , um , trying my camera out , .

i think its really nice .

sandy . hello .
detective bruno fella , cid .
hi , bruno .
im just saying this is a fabulous building .
i think its brilliant .
was it you had the scrape with the villains .
no , i wouldnt say it was a scrape .
well , they scraped my car .
no , i was running late for the first breakin .
i wasnt quite prepared for the second .
well , i get it , completely .
you know , completely get it , you know .
youre , um , disgruntled .
i would be , you know , putting all that effort .
into making such a fabulous building , you know , .
you know , you dont need the grief , do you .
well , its no fun , bruno .
you know , financially its a disaster .
the insurance is gonna be through the roof .
you know your problem , sandy .
whats my problem .
is what what is it .
i mean thats you there .
you got a british library over there .
with eurostar , and bang in the middle .
you got crack village with a load of somalians .
walking about with machetes .
its an area in flux .
oh , they left a computer disk , the burglars .
did you know that with my photographs .
oh . what do you mean where .
sorry , they returned it .
more than that , they downloaded my personal photographs .
off my laptop , that they stole the first time , .
and they brought it back .
well , can we see it .
lovely .
so they got compassion .
i wont go that far .
well , im not saying you gotta show them compassion .
you know , youre just like my girlfriend , my exgirlfriend .
theyre the criminals , theyre the bad guys .
can i have a go .
there dont you just love a mac .
sweet , huh .
and what do you say to your girlfriend .
im the old bill , will , you know .
ive been on the beat , undercover , in a suit , .
you know , its the law .
its , uh , einsteins law of relativity .
what does that mean , exactly , sir relativity .
well , relatively speaking , um , it means , if me and sandy here .
break the law , you know , were gonna get a decent lawyer .
now these guys who broke in here , .
they go straight to jail . do not pass go . .
one law for us , one for them .
except we havent broken the law .
everyones broken the law .
our vision for kings cross , .
for the public spaces .
of kings cross , starts with the premise .
that we acknowledge an urban landscape is a built landscape .
it starts as an argument with societys .
phony love affair with nature .
we are against the mistaking of grass for nature , .
of green for nature .
kings cross is an area of north london .
associated with poverty , crime , vice and urban decay .
our job is to transform the landscape , .
not decorate it with green .
because how we feel about ourselves , how we behave , .
is directly affected by the space around us .
how we design the outdoors of our city .
is as important as how we design the indoors .
were gonna take the canal , and use it like calligraphy , .
like ink , to write around the development .
we think its the cleaners .
what about the cleaners .
breaking in .
they dont even clean properly .
its true . they dont .
they never empty the dishwasher .
or load it , for that matter .
they bring their kids , their boyfriends .
come on . they do .
and to be honest , will , .
its getting a little traumatic .
im staying late at the office and worrying .
that the place is gonna be ransacked while im in it .
look , theyre cleaners and theyre not clean .
good , thanks .
thanks for the tea , thanks for the theory .
im sorry , but what does that mean .
it means your boyfriends been to the office , ruby , .
and yours , wei ping , .
and yours , actually , joe , .
so where do the rules say we can have boyfriends , .
but the cleaners cant .
or kids .
and explain this to me , please .
how the cleaners are getting up onto the roof .
then swinging through the roof line , and why they are , .
when theyve already got the keys and codes .
ive just been trying to defend our cleaners .
well , ive just spoken to the alarm company .
whoever broke in used the cleaners code .
what do we actually do if we see a burglar .
call the police kill them .
theres a weird ecology , .
of course , to these breakins .
the new computers , theyre upgrades , .
you know , theyre new models .
you could argue that .
a breakin every , oh , say , six months , .
its good business , isnt it .
just not every six days .
i wish they would steal this car , for instance .
42,000 miles .
ive got the criminal mind .
lots of wanting to be bad .
see an ass , want to bite it .
i just never do .
what youve done , there is you strayed .
from the moral to the criminal , .
and you crossed the moralcriminal divide .
wanting to bite an ass is a moral issue , .

who objects to the idea .
criminal would be biting the ass without permission .
youre such a lawyer .

youre somewhere behind the glass , .
but you cant hear me .
even when youre angry , like now , .
its like someone a long , long way away is angry with me .
well , glass is better than ice , which is where we were earlier .

i never got close to anybody who didnt want to talk about that .
mm . or free love .
liv ullmann . liv ullmann .

oh , thats right .
so , ive , uh , i tore my jacket .

she says .
well , you know , its: bea says i need . .
i say im here , she says , i need , .
i say im here . .
im not talking about going to work tomorrow , im just .
thinking about going back to work .
and start thinking about you .
about us .
bea can come with me sometimes .
she can dig , make a mess .
no , thats great , but youre busy and distracted .
shes not my daughter .
and right now when shes such a , shes so .
you cant trust me to take care of her .
if you were measuring how far .
away from where we need to be , you and me .
is that a long way .
i dont think you can ask a question like that . its .
put on a suit , sound like a suit .
it feels a long , long way right now .
from where it needs to be .
i wish we could unsay and unhurt .
back to wherever that is , .
and start again .
and how far back .
i remember you bit me .
you were angry with me and you bit me .
i dont remember why .
i dont know why either , but i remember i bit you .
you really bit me .
and i thought we were very close .
we were .
yeah , but thats just teeth .
its not invisible , but .
astonishing , great .
shall i put it on yes .
is there , somewhere .
uh , yeah , my sons room .
is he in .
no , no , hes at school .
your son , is he studying to be an architect .
no , hes only 15 .
its a school project .
im an architect .
of sorts .
funny .
your sons project .
we use those figures .
theyre scale figures .
theyre from japan .
hard to find in london .
he must get them from school .
uh , your trousers .
you have , uh , children .
oh , you were with a little girl .
my daughter . uhhuh .
i remember her .
this will take a week , at least .
ill have to remove the lining .
ill write you a bill for the jacket .
should i just write repairs .
a practice keyboard .
no space for piano up here .
you can play electric or electronic keyboard .
um , no , im happy with this .
you know , i imagine .
you know , so .
not a good place to make noises .
you could always use headphones .
im fixing this and i , um , should mind my own business .
people like me from my country , we im bosnian .
we think its dangerous not to be able to hear .
tell your son if hes interested , .
he can come and see our office , you know , to look around .
were very close .
i might do that .
will francis is your name .
shell never be his daughter .
you wish bea was wills daughter , is that it .
i wish she was .
then maybe wed all be happy .
i dont want to be cold .
i dont want to be sad .
i dont want to be angry with him anymore .
i have this light box .
what kind of light box .
for depression .
the doctor prescribed it .
and i sit in front of it for hours .
its supposed to stop me from getting down .
give me an image of that change that you hope for in will .
hes looking at me .
sugar .
uh , no , thank you .
i think youll want sugar .
are you unhappy .
what makes you say that .
you always seem , when you come here , i dont know .
im happy enough .
happy enough .
so english .
i think it was the happiest day , really .
when bea was born .
and then sometimes i think .
sometimes i think bea was punished .
because i left my husband and i left sweden .
and then i met will , and he was kind .
and we were happy , we really were .
but then i just push him away , i dont know why .
i just push him away from me .
oh , this is , um , this is going to sound really stupid .
i forgot the shirt .
i was going to bring a shirt .
for you , you to copy and .
i forgot , i forgot it .
um , all right .
should i go back and get it .
i can go back and get it now .
and id be , like , two seconds .
or perhaps when you come for the suit .
its a bad time .
you mean without the shirt .
right , that doesnt make any sense , does it .
im going to the supermarket .
right . i have to go to work .
how do you get the shopping home .
uh , bus .
im practically driving a bus .
my cars stolen , so i have a company van .
its electric .
you could probably walk faster .
pedestrians will overtake us .
say yes , and whats the worst thing that could happen .
tell me about your son .
mirsad mirsad .
he hates his name , .
but was a name for sarajevo , not for london .
now his names miro .
but i think he should love his name .
you know , names in my country , .
theyre like flags .
you can live or die because of your name .
mirsad its a muslim name .
it should be serbian because of his father , .
but , you know , i can be stubborn sometimes .
you what .
stubborn sometimes .
but that name saved his life .
when we , when we were getting out .
of sarajevo , we came out with red cross , leaving the siege .
the guards , the serbs , stopped us at one of the checkpoints , .
and they took him , they took my son , .
and they said whats your name .
and he said , mirsad , my name is mirsad , his muslim name .
well , if he told his family name , .
the serbian name , simic , .
they might have taken him as a son of a traitor .
anyway , since then , i dont think hes ever really .
hehe gets in trouble .
thats another story .
i cant talk about siege in supermarket , sorry .
we had a breakin .
several , actually , in our office .
something gets smashed , .
i mean , i mean , not just the windows .
but not all breakings bad , is it , you know .
i mean , you break habits .
maybe , maybe before you repair the window , .
you should smash a few more .
thats all i do , you see , in my job , i tidy up .
theres a mess between buildings , and we come in .
squeeze in bits of green , like dressing .
like lipstick , .
like pretty .
anyway , thats a roundabout way of saying .
the shape of your mouth , .
i could probably draw it by heart .
i was thinking , uh , that was a roundabout way .
of saying youre married , which i know , .
and i was thinking .
bosnian men would say less , but , uh .
would want more .
they love to talk , they love talk , believe me , but , uh , .
talk for them is politics , women for them is not talk .
thats crushing .
i didnt mean it bad .
shes going to be disappointed , but okay .
yeah . i have to take the boys to cricket .
heres mom .
dad cant make it .
aw .
but heres what were going to do .
its okay . look , sweet .
why cant dad come .
because hes working . he cant make it in time .
he never comes .
we have the videos , video , video , video .
hey hoopla .
stop . that stop there is very good .
i know . i realize .
again , again .
again again .
shes great , eh great .
its good , too , .
because the batteries are back in the remote .
its a mystery how these batteries finally went home .
just when we need them .
big mystery .
mystery two: how did you video this .
and be in the picture at the same time .
paul was cameraman .
paul beas trainer .
youve met him a hundred times .
paul loves mom .
no , paul loves bea .
does paul love me .
if you could do anything right now , what would it be .
i have to work , i have to get back .
oh , come on .
let me think . i dont know , uh .
change everything up until this moment .
uh , not my son , everything else .
i cant do that for you .
you didnt say what could you do .
what would i do is what you said , not what you could do .
what could i do .
i dont understand .
i dont understand , either .
if i had a magic wand , i dont know , .
persuade my son to come to sarajevo with me , .
start a new life .
and you , if you could do anything right now , .
what would you do .
hey , are you waking up .
i made bread .
i can smell them .
its hot . careful .
put on the telly; it might be on the news .
ha you are not so big i can sit on you .
ah , miro .
we should go home this summer to sarajevo .
i think you would love it .
tanja says there are flights for a few pounds .
hmm .
your grandmother would cry for weeks .
oh , uh , i forgot .
i put it in your room . whered you get it .
its a customer .
i sewed his jacket .
hes an architect .
he said , uh , you could go and look at his office .
i have to go out .
what did you say to him .
did he go in my room .
no . just to try some trousers .
why do people have to go into my room .
miro , dushma , hes a good person , hes a good man .
he was just trying to help .
you think everyone is good .
no one is good .
what are you .
im in such shit .
shes taken back the laptop .
she what .
that is so fucked up .
she says theyre friends .
yeah , but thats like , hello , my son did it .
lock him up . .
she says shes going to talk to him , do some sort of deal .
will .
lady looking for you .
what is it you want from me .
nothing , i dont want anything .
because you dont just walk into someones life .
and knock on their door and kiss them .
you cannot do that . i know that .
you used me; you have someone else .
oh , you mean liv promise me , promise me .
thats the last thing i want , believe .
promise you what .
promise you im not flirting .
i know what that is . i dont believe you .
i know what that is , .
and this is not what it is . i dont believe you .
i cant talk anymore .
i want to go somewhere and not talk .
not talk .
i have a friend; she she works .
maybe she would lend her place .
its close to here .
call her .
its not a hotel , its not a palace .
whats her number .
the clothes under my clothes , theyre not .
ive always wanted to make something in silk .
im , uh , giving myself to you .
i want it to be worth something .
im , uh , i never met somebody when i was already in their bed .
im will .
im tanja .
its good to have a man in my bed .
i hope its contagious .
ill get my , uh .
dont kill the boy , brave benoit said , .
but dai replied , .
why not i come from the isle of wight .
we eat young boys a lot . .
but secretly , dai had a heart .
he kept it in a jar .
he hadnt seen that jar for years .
he found it in his car . .
great reading .
thats not reading , thats knowing by heart .
theres a metaphor .
to know by heart .
forgive , forget , and eat more jam , the jar said on the lid .
dai ate some jam and thought a lot , .
and in the end , he did .
go home and be a better boy , .
although sometimes , its tricky .
there is a moral to this tale: .
jam makes fingers sticky . .
well done .
sticky jam .
okay , my sweetie .
it is now time for you and bunny .
to get some sleep .
youre a monkey , be a wise monkey .
somebody asks you a question , you know nothing , .
you see nothing , .
you hear nothing .
im not a monkey for sure .
your mothers a muslim dog . they have loose tongues .
are you my brothers son , or your mothers .

if the police find anything , were all going to prison .

theres no air in a cell .
and thats where youre going , no question , .
and thats a tragedy .
which of us is lying the most .
about what .
thats not even the right question .
which of us is lying to themselves the most .
about this .
im not lying .
i have , um .
a photograph .
of us .
its , uh .
incriminating isis the right the word .
i dont know if its the right word , .
unless i know what youre talking about .
it took me a .
a little while to make sense of the jacket .
you suddenly appearing at my door .
that youd been following my son .
you must know that mothers .
will do anything to protect their children .
whywhy would you take a photograph .
was that when your friend came back .
why would you do that .
why would you do this .
you steal someones heart; thats a real crime .
and then what you call the police .
i dont know no .
did you know how long .
do you know how long since anybody touched me .
i should have told you , i know . i should have said something .
it wasnt a plan .
it wasnt a plan it was you , thats the truth .
is that why you come to bed with me .
for what , a photograph .
how squalid .
the water is cold .
but what about but it .
it doesnt make any sense .
what about today .
or now .
look , a lie , thats right . thats my .
thats me i lie , i lie .
cant we drawn a line and say no more lies between us .
no more lies .
no , i have to ask you to lie , to continue to lie .
