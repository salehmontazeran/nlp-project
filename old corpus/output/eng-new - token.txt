back
allright
what
did
ben
wade
mean
about
sending
pa
back
all
right
is
he
saying
he
was
going
to
kill
him
ben
wade
dont
have
to
lift
a
finger

his
gang
will
do
it
for
him
your
father
can
take
care
of
himself
so

were
you
conscripted
into
lincolns
army

mr

evans
or
did
you
volunteered
neither
maybe
both
what
does
that
means
it
means
i
was
a
volunteer
for
the
massachusetts
state
guard
then
in

the
federal
government
was
running
low
on
men
so
they
called
in
the
state
militias
to
protect
washinton

and
thats
when
you
got
hurt
what
are
you
doing
out
here

dan
youve
got
a
family
to
protect
you
are
not
a
law
man

you
dont
work
for
the
railroad
like
mr

shinny
shoes
over
there
not
a
pinkerton
maybe
i
dont
like
the
idea
of
men
like
you
running
loose
its
mans
nature
to
take
what
he
wants

dan
its
how
we
are
born
well

i
make
an
honest
living
it
might
be
honest

but
i
dont
think
its
much
of
a
living
you
must
be
hurting
bad
for
money
to
take
this
job
go
to
sleep
i
imagine
debt
puts
a
lot
of
pressure
on
a
marriage
are
you
married
what
would
you
know
about
marriage
we
cant
all
be
cutthroats
and
thieves
well

i
know
that
if
i
was
lucky
enough
to
have
a
wife
like
alice

id
treat
her
a
whole
lot
better
than
you
do

dan
id
feed
her
better

id
buy
her
pretty
dresses

i
wouldnt
make
her
work
so
hard
yeah

id
bet
alice
was
a
real
pretty
girl
before
she
married
you
dont
talk
about
my
wife

you
shut
up
about
her

you
say
one
more
word
and
i
cut
your
tongue
id
like
the
sight
of
it
if
you
did
its
my
watch

now
i
suppose
its
too
much
to
ask
for
a
little
quiet
the
way
i
figured
it
id
be
asleep
in
my
own
bed
right
now
if
it
werent

you

for
us
were
going
to
contention
cant
say
i
didnt
warn
you
theres
a
shortcut
we
can
take
a
shortcut
through
the
pass
it
takes
you
right
through
contention
why
didnt
you
say
something
before
its
apache
country
i
thought
that
the
government
gave
them
land

these
are
the
ones
who
refused
to
go
i
wouldnt
take
that
path
you
want
us
to
take
the
long
way
thats
right
and
let
your
boys
catch
us
mr

butterfield

the
apache
who
lived
in
that
path
are
the
ones
that
stayed
to
fight
they
enjoy
killing
you
aint
going
to
make
it
well
take
our
chances
something
on
your
mind

dan
why
did
you
kill
tucker
why
not
me
or
butterfield
hell

tucker
took
my
horse
did
you
liked
him

dan
no
he
told
me
he
burned
down
your
barn
he
was
an
asshole
but
wishing
him
dead
and
killing
him
are
two
different
things
your
conscience
is
sensitive

dan
i
dont
think
its
my
favorite
part
of
you
mr

wade

if
you
want
to
talk
to
somebody

talk
to
me
i
dont
like
talking
to
you

byron
not
when
i
have
the
gun
no

that
aint
it

i
just
dont
find
you
that
interesting
laugh
it
up

doc

till
he
guts
you
like
a
fish
byron
is
like
a
song
with
one
note
did
you
ever
read
another
book
in
your
life

byron

besides
the
bible
no
need
byron
acts
pius

a
few
years
ago
when
he
was
under
contract
with
central
ive
seen
him
and
a
bunch
of
brother
pinks
mow
down

apache
women
and
children
renegades

gunning
down
railroad
men
and
their
families
picking
them
off
the
road

one
by
one

scalped
there
was
youngnes
running
around

crying
and
screaming
no
more
than

years
old
and
his
boys
shot
them
all
and
pushed
them
into
a
ditch
some
of
them
were
still
crying
i
guess
byron
figured
that
jesus
wouldnt
mind
apparently
jesus
dont
like
the
apache
keep
on
talking
all
the
way
to
yuma

right
up
on
them
steps
to
the
rope

straight
to
hell
yeah

the
day
i
die

byron
im
getting
sprung
from
hell
i
might
feel
the
same

if
id
come
from
the
seed
of
a
drunk
grave
digger
and
the
rancid
womb
of
a
whore
drop
it

dan
evans

it
toss
it
to
the
ground

on
the
ground

always
liked
you

byron
but

mother

welcome
to
tantallon
i
made
this
for
you
friends
look
at
us

the
tribes
of
britain
divided
weak

just
as
the
irish
like
us
but
if
we
were
one
land
united
we
would
outnumber
them
to
we
could
defeat
them
once
and
for
all

thats
why
were
here
today
to
sign
this
treaty
of
unification

who
would
be
king
the
strongest
among
us
lord
marke
look

we
follow
you

wictred

your
last
attempt

an
alliance

to

what
something

than
duty
and
death
why

how
do
you
feel
its
lord

very
moment

finds
everyone

tide
is
coming

tristan

we
both
know
this
cant
be

weve
known
it
from
the
start
that
doesnt
mean
it
isnt
true

it
is
it
just
cannot
be
i
want
to
know
that
youre
alive
somewhere
and
thinking
of
me
from
time
to
time
i
want
to
know
that
theres
more
to
this
life

and
i
cant
know
that
if
they
kill
you
a
cornish
warrior
may
be
ashore

seek
him
as
i
speak
hopefully

its
just
his
rotted
corpse

for
he
has
slain
your
betrothed
morholt
is
dead

fallen
in
battle
isolde
bragnae

catch
and
comfort

we
should
assault
the
british
straightaway
crush
them
with
maximum
force
maximum
force
the
one
butchered
by
markes
tribes
would
that
be
the
force
you
speak
of
well
not
confront
them
again
until
our
numbers
are
refreshed
and
until
then
well
have
cunning
divide
them
of
what
nature
a
prize

perhaps
whats
this
about
a
tournament
donnchadh
hes
offered
his
daughter
and
the
lands
of
lionath
as
dowry
to
whichever
english
tribe
wins
its
a
clever
way
of
setting
us
against
each
other
well

the
other
barons
will
see
through
that
as
baron
of
wessex
its
my
duty
to
fight
in
this
tournament
for
my
people
for
yourself

you
mean

and
what
of
the
support
you
promised
tristan
tristans
dead
my
people
have
suffered
enough
they
see
the
wealth
of
lionath
on
offer

that
seems
more
real
than
any
alliance
my
mind
is
set

and
ours
as
well
so
be
it

yeah

back
from
the
dead
tristan

the
irish
king
offers
his
daughter
in
tournament
and
divides
all
our
tribes
whether
for
the
power
or
the
wealth

half
the
barons
are
sending
champions
to
fight
at
dunluce

tristan
god
knows
what
happened
to
him
my
face
in
thine
eyes
thine
in
mine
appears
and
true
plain
hearts
do
in
the
faces
rest
whatever
dies
was
not
mixed
equally
if
our
two
loves
be
one
or
thou
and
i
love
so
alike
that
none
can
slacken

none
can
die
what
its
the
only
way
to
keep
the
alliance
alive
i
fail
to
see
how
fighting
with
our
partners
keeps
us
allies
well

theyre
all
going
to
the
tournament
anyway
by
announcing
youll
share
the
dowry
with
every
baron
who
remains
loyal

in
turn
offering
support
to
whomever
prevails
the
others
will
be
compelled

follow
you
when

my
lord

a
place
without
duty

would
you
be
with
me
that
place
does
not
exist
ill
pretend
its
you
youre
trembling
youre
far
from

im
a
stranger
still

that
i

but
you

fear
me

hmm
my
only
wish
is
to
make
you

as
a
wife

as
a
woman
and
hopefully

one
day
the
fact
that
im
not
whole
will
not
offend
you
thats
pretty

did
you
make
it
it
was
a
present
tristan

might
i
stay
here
a
while
of
course
a
little
bit
sour

but
taste
it
ive
never
seen
him
like
this
before
perhaps
someone
his
own
age
should
speak
with
him
perhaps
marke
and
edyth
say
youre
distant
theyre
worried
about
you

so
am
i

i
can
tell
laughing
at
the
market

holding
hands
a
caress
on
the
neck
when
he
pours
your
wine
hes
my
husband

i
remember
whose
kingdom
im
in
and
why

yes

well

i
must
confess
i
thought
you
might
have
the
tiniest
of
difficulties
performing
your
duties
am
i
not
permitted
a
single
moment
without
mourning
im
living
with
this

tristan

as
you
said
we
must
i
live
in
torture

thinking
of
these
moments
every
look
he
gives
you

i
get
sicker
and
sicker
theres
a
burning
in
me

i
feel
on
fire

and
theres
guilt

and
i
cant
get
rid
of
either
does
it
make
you
happy
to
know
that
the
roman
bridge
i
can
get
to
it
without
being
seen
and
i
would
go
there
any
time
to
be
with
you
welcome

barons
of
anglia

rothgar
and
orick
wessex

kaye
and
wictred
as
you
will
be
king
and
his
daughter
queen
does
that
mean
donnchadh
will
be
coming
to
the
coronation
it
does

on
the
next
full
moon

all
will
attend
a
lot
can
happen
in
a
month
and
given
the
instabilities
of
our
new
land
i
shall
be
naming
a
second
my
sister
has
raised
one
capable
of
guiding
you

should
the
need
arise
hes
a
man
of
passion

fierce
in
battle
who
has
learned
to
tame
his
heart
with
his
head
i
give
you
tristan
of
aragon
for
the
first
time
since
the
romans
this
country
stands
united
i
cant
be
your
second

melot
must
be

hes
blood
besides

i
wish
tojourney
north
you
no
longer
sleep
at
dor

and
now
you
dont
want
to
be
my
second
and
you
find
no
comfort
in
your
home

these
stone
walls
that
you
helped
build
i
find
these
walls
a
prison

why
everything
i
wanted
seems
meaningless
ever
since
you
were
a
boy
youve
sacrificed
everything
for
me

all
for
one
dream
now
youve
reached
that
dream
its
natural
that
youll
feel
some
loss
it
doesnt
matter
if
you
want
to
be
second

you
are
i
will
only
be
king
if
you
are
my
second
id
put
it
more
gently
if
i
could

then
i
am
your
second
perhaps
its
time
you
took
a
wife

no
you
cant
live
alone
forever

i
can
i
was
trying
to
explain
to
tristan
the
importance
oflove
seems
he
might
live
without
it

why
there
are
other
things
to
live
for
duty

honor
they
are
not
life

tristan

they
are
the
shells
of
life
and
empty
ones
if
in
the
end
all
they
hold
are
days
and
days
without
love
love
is
made
by
god
ignore
it
and
you
suffer
as
you
cannot
imagine
then
i
will
no
longer
live
without
it
good

very
good
come

well
be
late

late
the
warriors
ride
out
on
the
full
moon
its
an
old
ritual

i
shall
miss
you
tonight
how
many
did
you
love
before
me
none
and
after
me
lord
marke
are
you
all
right
nothing
hurt
but
my
pride
tristan

i
need
to
speak
with
you

yeah
we
havent
even
had
a
coronation
yet

and
marke
and
wictred
are
already
at
odds
now

he
breaks
tradition
and
scares
all
the
barons
by
naming
you
his
second
i
tried
to
convince
him
youd
be
better
yes

well

peace
can
be
just
as
treacherous
as
war
and
i
fear
that
marke
doesnt
re
listen
to
me
our
attention
must
be
on
cornwall

now
more
than
ever

melot
im
sorry
he

choose
you

am
can

moaning

nine
years
to
merit

your

the
ring
they
are
an
army
unlike
any

crusading
across
the
stars
toward
a
place
called
underverse
their
promised
land

a
constellation
of
dark
new
worlds
necromongers
theyre
called
and
if
they
cannot
convert
you

they
will
kill
you
leading
them

the
lord
marshal
he
alone
has
made
a
pilgrimage
to
the
gates
of
the
underverse
and
returned
a
different
being
stronger

stranger

half
alive
and
half
something
else
if
we
are
to
survive

a
new
balance
must
be
found
in
normal
times

evil
would
be
fought
by
good
but
in
times
like
these
well

it
should
be
fought
by
another
kind
of
evil

convert

kill
every
last
human
life

a
story

riddick

of

each
time
a
dynasty

remember
your
place

dame
vaako
my
place
is
at
your
side

dear
husband
from
here
till
underverse
come
in
this
verse

humans
have
been
fractured
divided
by
all
their
many
races

creeds

and
mistaken
faiths
our
purpose
is
to
correct
that
mistake
because
there
is
another
verse
another
universe
that
he
has
found
where
anyone
can
begin
anew
where
you
can
live
free
of
pain
a
perfect
new
place
called
underverse
look
around
you

every
necromonger
in
this
hall
every
one
of
the
legion
vast
that
just
swept
aside
your
defences
in
one
night
was
once
like
you
fought
as
feebly
as
you
because
every
necromonger
that
lives
today
is
a
convert
therell
be
no
conversions
we
all
began
as
something
else
it
was
hard
for
me
to
accept

too

when
i
first
heard
these
words
but
i
changed
i
let
them
take
away
my
pain
you
betrayed
your
faith

and
i
changed
just
as
you
will
change
when
you
realise
that
the
underverse
will
be
reached
only
by
those
who
have
embraced
the
necromonger
faith
for
those
of
you
who
will
right
now
drop
to
your
knees
and
ask
to
be
purified
we
will
not
renounce
our
faith
no
one
here
will
do
what
you
ask
it
is
unthinkable
this
is
a
world
of
many
peoples

many
religions
and
we
simply
cannot
and
will
not
be
converted
then
ill
take
your
soul
join
him
or
join
me
this
is
your
one
chance
take
the
lord
marshals
offer
and
bow
i
bow
to
no
man
hes
not
a
man
hes
the
holy
halfdead
who
has
seen
the
underverse
and
returned
with
powers
you
cant
imagine
look

im
not
with
everyone
here
but
i
will
take
a
piece
of
him
a
piece
you
will
have
stop
him
irgun

one
of
my
best
if
you
say
so
what
do
you
think
of
this
blade
i
think
its
a
halfgram
heavy
on
the
back
end
in
our
faith

you
keep
what
you
kill
take
him
back
to
my
ship
for
mind
regression
perhaps
the
breeder
would
do
it
if
somebody
just
asked
him
it
is
a
rare
offer
a
visit
inside
necropolis
its
been
a
long
time
since
i
smelled
beautiful
let
me
show
you
the
way
beautiful
eyes

come
the
last
six
lord
marshals
have
called
this
home
magnificent

isnt
it
i
might
have
gone
a
different
way

true
of
us
all
converts
receiving
the
mark
of
the
necromonger
they
learn
how
one
pain
can
lessen
another
there
now
that
is
just
perfect
the
more
you
resist
them
the
greater
the
damage
will
be
a
new
one
youve
brought
us
a
new
one
interesting
breeder
making
entry
this
wont
take
long
weve
entered
his
neocortex
the
riddick
regress
scanning
fresh
memories
thoughts
of
someone
called
jack
jack
she
went
to
prison
now
we
find
thoughts
of
an
elemental
the
one
race
that
would
slow
the
spread
of
necromongers
furyans
where
does
he
come
from
who
are
his
people
these
are
the
things
i
need
to
know
we
find
energy
we
find
furyan
energy
hes
furyan
a
furyan
survivor
kill
the
furyan
kill
the
riddick
kill
riddick
find
him

whatever
it
takes

find
him
let
me
guess

a
fiveman
crew
this
time
couple
of
things
you
could
have
done
better
first

trash
the
locater
beacon
inside
my
ship

the
one
you
jacked
and
second

and
this
is
really
the
more
important
part
you
should
have
wasted
me
when
you
had
the
chance
any
questions
yeah
what
took
you
so
long
decoy
launched
in
and
out

unsuspected
and
undetected
damn

i
love
a
good
smashandgrab
bountys
as
good
as
ours

preparing
to
engage
ion
drive
so
where
do
we
drop
your
merckilling
ass
whos
gonna
pay
the
most
for
you
now
butcher
bay
butcher
bay
ten
minutes
every
other
day
on
the
dogrun
protein
waffles
arent
bad
how
about
ursa
luna
nice
little
doublemax
prison
they
keep
a
cell
open
for
me

just
in
case
i
drop
in
you
know
the
problem
with
these
joints
now
health
clubs
for
waffleeating
pussies
maybe
we
should
think
about
upping
our
game
here
a
little
bit
think
about
someplace
truly
diabolical
what
the
hell
is
he
thinking
now
hes
thinking
a
triplemax
prison

a
nodaylight
slam
only
three
of
them
left
in
this
system
two
of
them
out
of
range
for
a
shitty
little
undercutter
like
this
one
with
no
legs
leaving
just
one
crematoria
that
is
what
you
had
in
mind

right

toombs
how
does
he
know
where
were
going

and
we
dont
dope
it
out

i
hate
this
run
just
do
it
dont
know
about
this
new
crew
of
yours
they
seem
a
bit
skittish
probably
shouldnt
tell
them
what
happened
to
the
last
crew
you
know

you
were
supposed
to
be
some
slickshit
killer
now
look
at
you

all
backofthebus
and
shit
i
say
we
attack
helion
two
next

take
it
straight
into
their
teeth
itll
cost
you

heads


warrior
ships
nothing
more

i
swear
it

while
i
do
prize
brute
force
this
approach
is

perhaps

more
artful
start
at
the
end

go
straight
to
helion
five
the
last
planet
in
the
system
we
approach
from
the
night
side
remove
these
cannon
first
then
attack
the
larger
placements
at
speed
well
catch
them
on
their
rear
flank
and
in

days
time
the
rest
of
those
worlds
will
tumble
before
us
you
see

as
with
most
their
blind
spot
is
right
behind
them
ive
located
an
ion
trail
which
leads
offworld
then
you
should
be
offworld

vaako
ive
deployed
a
tracker
team

one
of
the
best
wherever
riddick
has
gone
you
lens
him
out
and
cleanse
him

you
you
want
me
to
take
a
frigate
for
one
breeder
dont
question
it

vaako
take
it
on
faith
hes
always
been
unsettled
around
you
the
lord
marshal

unsteady
perhaps
because
he
knows
hes
half
the
warrior
you
are
some
say
hes
too
artistic
for
the
job
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
someone
promoted
him
soon
to
full
dead
take
care
what
you
say

should
i
say
it
softly
so
it
sounds
more
like
conspiracy
why
is
it
that
when
anyone
breathes
about
the
demise
of
him
on
the
throne
everyone
assumes
a
conspiracy
why
isnt
that
just
prudent
planning
when
he
is
ready

he
will
name
a
successor
who
toal
scales
the
purifier
none
of
them
with
the
strength

the
dignity
of
lord
vaako
you
can
keep
what
you
kill
that
is
the
necromonger
way
mercenaries

elementals

necromongers
how
unexpected
an
elemental

here
one
of
the
captives
and
why

after

years

should
it
be
you
he
doesnt
regard
her
as
a
captive

though
elementals

they
talk
of
neutrality

but
theyre
all
witches
and
spies
why
else
would
they
come
and
go
like
the
wind
but
where
has
he
gone
where
is
the
furyan
hiding
now
you
be
the
good
warrior

go
after
this
riddick
ill
find
out
why
the
lord
marshal
is
so
threatened
by
him
destination
reached

unlocking
manual
controls
all
right

i
make

degrees
on
the
day
side
below
on
the
night
side
lets
not
get
caught
in
the
sun
if
i
owned
this
place
and
hell

id
rent
this
place
out
and
live
in
hell
slue
angle
good

stand
by
and
plotted
course
good

hit
it
angle
of
approach
not
good
look

ma

no
hands
party
poppers
i
think
i
shit
myself
skittish

toombs

very
skittish
comfy
when
the
rides
over

your
goggles
are
mine
fourway
split
kilometres
so
this
is
riddick
what
in
the
bowels
of
christ
are
you
talking
about
dont
take
this
one

boss
see

anatoli
here
has
a
nose
for
trouble
and
this
one

this
riddick
guy
big

big
trouble
so

is
good
money
id
take
the
money

toombs
these
are
dangerous
days

if
you
believe
the
talk
talk
about
dead
planets
about
some
ghost
army
about
them
them
ill
run
the
numbers
again

it
takes
a
couple
of
days
probably
so
you
can
stay
as
my
guest
at
least
here
we
are
all
safe

yes
yes

boss
ill
give
it
a
day
one
there
are
inmates

and
there
are
convicts
a
convict
has
a
certain
code
and
he
knows
to
show
a
certain
respect
an
inmate

on
the
other
hand
pulls
the
pin
on
his
fellow
man
does
the
guards
work
for
them

brings
shame
to
the
game
so
which
are
you
gonna
be
im
just
passing
through
welcome
to
crematoria
how
do
i
get
eyes
like
that
you
got
to
kill
a
few
people
did
that

did
a
lot
of
that
and
then
you
got
to
get
sent
to
a
slam
where
youre
told
you
wont
see
daylight
again
there
wasnt
a
doctor
who
could
shine
my
eyes
not
even
for

menthol
kools

was
anything
you
said
true
what
are
you
gonna
do
go
for
the
sweet
spot
remember
who
youre
talking
to

jack
jacks
dead
she
was
weak
she
couldnt
cut
it
the
names
kyra
now
and
im
a
new
animal
im
so
glad
i
could
steal
you
away
for
a
moment
doesnt
it
strike
you
odd
here
we
have
the
current
lord
marshal
destroying
entire
societies
and
yet
he
cant
bring
himself
to
kill
one
stranded
elemental
why
is
that
you
dont
pray
to
our
god

you
pray
to
no
god

i
hear
elementals

we
calculate
dont
we
all
but
now
lets
have
first
things
first
what
of
riddick
in
truth

i
dont
know
where
he
went
in
truth

im
more
interested
in
where
he
came
from
watch
your
step
ive
always
wondered

does
an
air
elemental
fly
now
do
me
a
favour
calculate
the
odds
of
you
getting
off
this
planet
alive
and
now
cut
them
in
half
no

we
cant
fly

but
we
glide
very
well
save
your
threats

necromonger
i
would
have
told
you
about
riddick
for
the
asking
it
concerns
a
foretelling
a
prediction
now
more
than

years
old
a
young
warrior
once
consulted
a
seer
of
sorts
and
was
told
that
he
would
die
at
the
hands
of
a
furyan
so
he
waged
a
private
war
on
the
planet
furya
killing
all
he
could
find
this
was
before
he
became
lord
marshal

of
course
that
massacre
should
have
ended
the
matter
but
now
it
seems
one
furyan
had
a
knack
for
escape
feeding
time
move
lets
go
come
on
hurry
to
the
cages
a
herd
a
goddamn
herd
is
that
all
we
are
to
you
let
me
in
wait
its
an
animal
thing
check
her
for
me

shes
always
got
a
blade
somewhere
i
dont
think
she
likes
being
touched
id
take
my
wounded
and
go
while
you
still
can
is
there
a
name
for
this
private
little
world
of
yours
what
happens
there
when
we
dont
just
run
away
youll
kill
us
with
a
soup
cup
tea

actually
ill
kill
you
with
my
tea
cup
you
know
the
rule
they
arent
dead
if
theyre
still
on
the
books
death
by
tea
cup
damn

why
didnt
i
think
of
that
i
didnt
come
here
to
play
whos
the
better
killer
but
its
my
favourite
game

havent
you
heard
i
heard
you
came
looking
for
me
is
that
all
then
you
missed
the
good
part
hooked
up
with
some
mercs
out
of
lupus
five
said
theyd
take
me
on

teach
me
the
trade

give
me
a
good
cut
they
slaved
me
out

riddick
do
you
know
what
that
could
do
to
you
when
youre
that
age
when
youre

years
old
i
told
you
to
stay
in
new
mecca
did
you
not
listen
i
had
mercs
on
my
neck

ill
always
have
mercs
on
my
neck
i
spent
five
years
on
a
frozen
heap
just
to
keep
them
away
from
you
and
you
go
and
sign
up
with
the
same
fake
badges
that
wanted
to
cut
you
up
and
use
you
for
bait
what
are
you
pitching

riddick
that
you
cutting
out
was
a
good
thing
that
you
had
my
ass
covered
from
halfway
across
the
universe
you
signed
with
mercs
there
was
nobody
else
around
lets
pop
the
cork

get
some
fresh
air
so
they
do
go
topside
to
swap
out
air
interesting
who
the
hell
are
you
when
it
happens

itll
happen
fast
stay
on
my
leg
when
i
cut
fence

or
die
here
nobody
outs
this
place

nobody
he
aint
nobody
seven
hundred
degrees
jesus

why
im
here
at
all
good
news
first
talked
things
over
with
my
amigos
here
well
cut
you
in
for
all
right

whats
the
bad
news
they
close
the
local
whorehouse
no

the
bad
news
is
worse
than
that

much
worse
our
pilot

he
saw
this
it
crossed
a
shipping
lane
any
idea
what
this
might
be
never
saw
nothing
like
it
this
ship
charts
back
to
helion
prime
you
know

anatolis
got
a
nose
for
trouble
and
he
thinks
trouble
follows
you
here
look

we
dusted
our
tracks
and
got
the
hell
out
of
there
there
is
no
way
we
didnt
lose
them
this
is
my
prisoner
mine

nobody
elses
and
i
want
my
money
now
you
stole
a
prisoner
from
them
riddick

no
shouldve
taken
the
money

toombs
mercs
some
guards
here

but
this
cant
be
all
of
them
check
their
slots
in
the
back

and
be
careful
dont
bother

guards
aint
there
they
figured
out
the
necros
are
coming
for
me
plan
was
to
clean
the
bank

ghost
the
mercs
break
wide
through
the
tunnel
then
somebody
got
a
lucky
shot
off
with
this
rocket
launcher
here
and
took
out
the
sled
guards
took
off
on
foot
but
rigged
the
door
so
no
one
could
follow
theyll
take
the
one
ship
in
the
hangar
and
leave
everyone
else
here
to
die
how
come
you
know
all
this
shit
you
werent
even
here
cause
it
was
my
plan
its
moving
in
the
right
direction

we
could
make
it
stay
behind
the
night
ahead
of
the
sun
theres
gonna
be
one
speed
mine
if
you
cant
keep
up

dont
step
up

youll
just
die
i
shouldve
taken
the
money
up
there
take
a
look

because
anatoli
says
so
because
his
nose
says
so
go
come
on

go
climb
here
climb
go
theyre
heading
for
the
volcano
fields
going
for
our
ship
no
chance
do
they
get
to
the
hangar
first

no
chance
next
one
next
hole
well
catch
them
there
no
more
running
for
you
where
did
the
big
guy
go
close
it
what
was
that
you
dont
care
if
you
live
or
die
if
i
kill
them
first

not
really
maybe
i
do
keep
moving
kyra
kyra
what
get
that
ass
moving
remember
what
i
said
about
not
caring
if
i
lived
or
died
you
knew
i
was
kidding

right
one
speed
your
rope
its
too
late

were
never
gonna
make
it
your
rope
give
me
your
rope
and
your
water

all
of
it
stay
in
the
shadow
of
the
mountain
dont
wait
for
me

run
where
the
hell
is
that
hangar
there
it
is
listen
let
me
guess

necros
one
commander
five
captains

and
a
whole
lot
of
necro
firepower
shit
i
hate
not
being
the
bad
guys
i
figure
we
got
three
minutes
before
the
sun
hits
us
again

burns
out
this
whole
valley
we
gonna
do
this
or
not
just
wait
remember
that
favourite
game
of
yours
whos
the
better
killer
lets
play
on
the
right
hand
i
was
supposed
to
deliver
a
message
to
you
if
vaako
failed
to
kill
you
a
message
from
the
lord
marshal
himself
he
tells
you
to
stay
away
from
helion
stay
away
from
him
and
in
return

youll
be
hunted
no
more
but
vaako
will
most
likely
report
you
as
dead
so
this
is
your
chance
your
chance
to
do
what
no
man
has
ever
done
the
girl
where
will
they
take
her
to
the
lord
marshal

of
course
ive
done
unbelievable
things
in
the
name
of
a
faith
that
was
never
my
own
and
hell
do
to
her
what
he
did
to
me
the
necromonger
in
me
warns
you
not
to
go
back
but
the
furyan
in
me
hopes
you
wont
listen
we
all
began
as
something
else
i
have
lost
a
purifier
but
i
have
gained
a
first
among
commanders
it
is
overdue

isnt
it
that
we
acknowledge
your
many
accomplishments
your
steady
faith
your
unflinching
loyalty
obedience
without
question

loyalty
till
underverse
come
well
done

vaako
this
is
a
day
of
days
now

tell
me
if
its
true
tell
me
the
furyan
is
gone
and
i
can
close
this
campaign
without
hearing
his
bootsteps
if
he
is
dead
i
sense
im
not
far
from
the
same
fate
being
of
no
further
use
here
shouldnt
i
tell
you
that
riddick
is
still
alive
dont
try
me

aereon
i
could
plough
you
under
with
the
rest
of
helion
prime
no
one
really
knows
the
future
then
tell
me
the
odds
that
vaako
met
with
success
that
i
will
now
be
the
one
who
can
finish
it
all
conquering
or
converting
all
the
remaining
worlds
of
man
tell
me
its
true

aereon
and
maybe
ill
save
your
home
world
for
last
the
odds
are
good
that
riddick
is
still
alive
ascension
protocol
we
still
have
numbers
out
there

lord
marshal
sweep
teams

recon
ships
they
would
be
hardpressed
to
make
it
back
get
my
armada
off
the
ground
you
mean
on
helion
i
mean
here
on
this
very
ship
could
you
be
wrong
mind
fabricates
fear

could
you
be
wrong
not
so
wrong
as
you
when
you
left
him
alive
its
twice
a
mistake
not
only
your
failure

but
now
the
report
of
success
how
do
we
salvage
this
how
lord
marshals
got
to
be
warned
you
will
never
see
the
underverse
he
will
kill
us
both
before
our
due
time
i
say
give
riddick
his
chance
if
he
is
half
of
what
you
think
he
can
at
least
wound
the
lord
marshal
and
that
is
when
you
must
act
just
to
take
his
place
just
to
keep
what
i
kill
that
is
the
necromonger
way
it
is
not
enough
then
you
do
it
for
the
faith
if
he
has
fear

he
has
weakness
if
he
has
weakness

vaako
he
is
unworthy
of
lordship
we
do
it
for
all
necromongers
protect
the
faith

still
be
a
day

necromonger

first
but
after
a
while

the
pain
goes
away

just
as
they
promise

a
moment
when

start

what
would
be
the
odds
of
that
this
dark
army
at
the
feet
of
a
ione
outlaw
and
the
fate
of
the
rest
of
the
universe
not
even
i
dare
to
calculate
that
in
order
to
effect
a
timely
halt
to
deteriorating

to
ensure
the

a

lord
beckett
theyve
started
to
sing

sir
finally
for
any
who
are
ignorant
of
his
meaning
particularly
a
woman
particularly
a
woman
alone
what
makes
you
think
shes
alone
you
protect
her
and
what
makes
you
think
i
need
protecting
your
masters
expecting
us
and
an
unexpected
death
would
cast
a
slight
pall
on
our
meeting
have
you
heard
anything
from
will
i
trust
young
turner
to
acquire
the
charts
and
you
to
remember
your
place
in
the
presence
of
captain
sao
feng
is
he
that
terrifying
hes
much
like
myself

but
absent
my
merciful
nature
and
sense
of
fair
play
do
you
think
because
she
is
a
woman
we
would
not
suspect
her
of
treachery
well

when
you
put
it
that
way
remove
please
captain
barbosa
welcome
to
singapore
more
steam
none
of
that

if
things
dont
go
the
way
they
want

then
were
the
only
chance
theyve
got
i
understand
that
you
have
a
request
to
make
of
me
more
of
a
proposal
to
put
thee
ive
a
venture
underway

and
i
find
myself
in
need
of
a
ship
and
a
crew
its
an
odd
coincidence
because
you
happen
to
have
a
ship
and
a
crew
you
dont
need
because
earlier
this
day

no
far
from
here
a
thief
broke
into
my
most
revered
uncles
temple
and
tried
to
make
home
with
these
the
navigational
charts
the
route
to
the
farthest
ticket
wouldnt
it
be
amazing
if
this
venture
of
yours
took
you
to
the
world
beyond
this
one
it
would
strain
credulity

at
that
this
is
the
thief
is
his
face
familiar
to
you
then
i
guess
he
has
no
further
need
for
it
you
come
into
my
city
and
you
betray
my
hospitality
sao
feng

i
assure
you

i
had
no
idea
that
he
would
get
caught
you
intend
to
attempt
a
voyage
to
davy
jones
locker
but
i
cannot
help
but
wonder
the
song
has
been
sung
the
time
is
upon
us
we
must
convene
the
brethren
court
as
one
of
the
nine
pirate
lords
you
must
honor
the
call
there
is
a
price
on
all
our
heads
it
is
true
and
since
the
only
way
a
pirate
can
turn
a
profit
anymore
is
by
betraying
other
pirates
its
the
time
to
put
our
differences
aside
wait
for
the
signal
the
first
now
that
rule
is
being
challenged
by
lord
cutler
beckett
against
east
india
trading
company
what
value
is
the
brethren
court
you
can
fight
get
off
me
you
are
sao
feng

the
pirate
lord
of
singapore
would
you
have
that
era
come
to
an
end
on
your
watch
the
most
notorious
pirates
from
around
the
world
are
uniting
against
our
enemy
and
yet
you
sit
here
cowering
in
your
bathwater
elizabeth
swann
there
is
more
to
you
than
meets
the
eye
isnt
there
and
the
eye
does
not
go
wanting
but
i
cannot
help
but
notice
you
have
failed
to
answer
my
question
what
is
it
you
seek
in
davy
jones
locker
jack
sparrow
hes
one
of
the
pirate
lords
the
only
reason
i
would
jack
sparrow
return
from
the
land
of
the
dead
is
so
i
can
send
him
back
myself
jack
sparrow
holds
one
of
the
nine
pieces
of
eight
he
failed
to
pass
it
along
to
a
successor
before
he
died
so
we
must
go
and
get
him
back
so
you
admit
you
have
deceived
me
weapons
sao
feng

i
assure
you

our
intentions
are
strictly
honorable
drop
your
weapons
or
i
kill
the
man
kill
him

hes
not
our
man
if
hes
not
with
you
and
hes
not
with
us
who
is
he
with
set

fire
doublez
set
its
an
odd
coincidence

isnt
it
the
east
india
trading
company
finds
me
the
day
you
show
up
in
singapore
it
is
coincidence
only
if
you
want
to
make
a
deal
with
beckett
you
need
what
i
offer
you
crossed
barbosa
you
are
willing
to
cross
jack
sparrow
why
should
i
expect
any
better
i
need
the
black
pearl
to
free
my
father
youre
helping
me
to
get
it
thank
you

jack
you
have
the
charts
and
better
yet
a
ship
with
a
crew
wheres
sao
feng
hell
cover
our
escape
and
meet
us
in
shipwreck
cove
hold
it
stiff
into
the
wind
theres
no
place
left
for
sao
feng
to
cower
do
you
think
he
will
honor
the
call
i
cannot
say
there
is
an
evil
and
disease
that
even
the
most
staunch
and
bloodthirsty
pirates
have
come
to
fear
a
piece
of
eight
nine
of
them

you
say
our
new
friend
in
singapore
was
very
specific

sir
nine
pieces
of
eight
whats
the
significance
of
that

i
wonder
does
it
matter
nothing
can
hold
against
the
armada

not
even
the
flying
dutchman

i
believe
nothing
we
know
of
did
your
friend
happen
to
mention
where
the
brethren
court
are
meeting
he
was
mum
on
that

sir
then
he
knows
the
value
of
information
better
keep
this
between
ourselves
we
dont
want
anyone
running
off
to
singapore

do
we
ah

admiral
you
summoned
me

lord
beckett
yes

something
for
you
there
your
new
station
deserves
an
old
friend
not
more
requisition
orders
no
sir
execution
the
brethren
know
they
face
extinction
all
that
remains
is
for
them
to
decide
where
they
make
their
final
stand
no
one
said
anything
about
cold
im
sure
there
must
be
a
good
reason
for
our
suffering
why
dont
that
woman
just
bring
jack
back
the
same
way
she
brought
back
barbosa
because
barbosa
was
only
dead
jack
sparrow
is
taken
in
body
and
soul
to
a
place
not
of
death
but
punishment
the
worst
fate
a
person
can
bring
upon
himself
stretching
on
forever
thats
what
awaits
in
davy
jones
locker
i
mean

that
was
a
good
reason
nothing
here
is
said
it
is
hardly
as
accurate
as
modern
charts

no
but
it
leads
to
more
places
over
the
edge
over
again
sunrise
sets
flash
of
green
do
you
care
to
interpret
ever
gazed
upon
the
green
flash

master
gibbs
i
reckon
ive
seen
my
fair
share
happens
on
rare
occasion
at
the
last
glimpse
of
sunset

a
green
flash
shoots
up
into
the
sky
some
go
their
whole
lives
without
ever
seeing
it
some
claimed
to
have
seen
it
who
aint

and
some
say
it
signals
when
a
soul
comes
back
to
this
world
from
the
dead
sorry
trust
me

young
master
turner
its
not
getting
to
the
land
of
the
dead
thats
the
problem
its
getting
back
back
to
lift
the
sail
aye

aye

sir
bloody
hell

theres
nothing
left

is
a
loose
cannon

sir
fetch
the
chest
and
the
governour
hes
been
asking
questions
about
the
heart
does
he
know
then
perhaps
his
usefulness
has
run
its
course
steady

men
all
of
you
and
take
that
infernal
thing
with
you
i
will
not
have
it
on
my
ship
oh

im
sorry
to
hear
that
because
i
will
because
it
seems
to
me
the
only
way
to
ensure
that
this
ship
do
as
directed
by
the
company
we
need
prisoners
to
interrogate
which
tends
to
work
best
when
theyre
alive
the
dutchman
sails
as
its
captain
commands
and
its
captain
is
to
sail
it
as
commanded
i
would
have
thought
youd
learned
that
when
i
had
ordered
you
to
kill
your
pet
this
is
no
longer
your
world

jones
the
immaterial
charge
how
long
will
we
continue
not
talking
once
we
rescue
jack

everything
will
be
fine
then
we
rescue
jack
there
is
a
cost
must
be
payed
in
the
end
barbosa
ahead

my
eye

sir
proper

is
neither
proper
nor
suitable

sir

it
is
not
acceptable

nor
adequate
it
is
an
obvious
fact
an
abomination
begging
your
pardon

sir

but
perhaps
if
you
gave
a
man
another
chance
shall
i
that
sort
of
thinking
got
us
into
mess
we
have
lost
speed

precious
time
which
cannot
be
recovered
once
lost
do
you
understand

you
now

at
the
time
it
seemed
so
important
come
on
board
and
a
heart
i
learnt
that
if
you
stab
the
heart
yours
must
take
its
place
and
you
will
sail
the
seas
for
eternity
the
dutchman
must
have
a
captain
silly
thing
to
die
for
someone
cast
a
line
come
back
with
us
i
told
you

im
destiny
take
the
line
i
was
so
proud
of
you

elizabeth
she
must
not
leave
the
ship
father
please
come
with
us
please
dont
leave
me
ill
give
your
love
to
your
mother

shall
i
i
wont
let
you
go
elizabeth
he
made
peace
rums
gone

too
if
we
cannot
escape
these
doldrums
before
night
i
fear
we
will
sail
on
trackless
seas
doomed
to
between
worlds
forever
with
no
water

forever
looks
to
be
arriving
a
mite
too
soon
why
doesnt
he
do
something
me
eye
give
it
back
theres
no
sense
to
it
and
the
green
flash
happens
at
sunset
not
sunrise
god

driving
me
over
the
blooming
edge
sunrises
dont
set
up
is
down
well

thats
just
maddeningly
unhelpful
why
are
these
things
never
clear
clear
as
mud

jacky

what
stab
the
heart

dont
stem
the
heart
come
again
the
dutchman
must
have
a
captain
well

thats
even
more
than
less
than
unhelpful
sail
the
seas
for
eternity
i
love
the
sea

what
about
port
i
prefer
rum
rums
good
making
port
where
we
can
get
rum
and
salty
wenches
once
every
ten
years
what
did
you
say
ten
years
is
a
long
time

mate
even
longer

given
the
deficit
of
rum
but
eternity
is
longer
still
and
how
will
you
be
spending
it
dead
or
not
the
immortal
captain
sparrow
well

id
love
that
come
sunset

it
wont
matter
sundown
and
rise
up
what
do
you
think
where
there
what
is
it
were
rocking
the
ship
aye

hes
on
to
it
hes
rocking
the
ship
we
tie
each
other
to
the
mast
upside
down

so
when
the
boat
flips
well
be
the
right
way
up
swell
loose
the
cannons

you
unstow
the
cargo
let
it
surf
now
up
is
down
blessed
sweet
westerlies
were
back
theres
the
sunrise
we
need
our
pistols

get
untied

alright
alright
then
the
brethren
court
has
a
gathering
at
shipwreck
cove
and
jack

you
and
i
are
agoing

and
therell
be
no
arguing
that
point
i
is
arguing
the
point
if
these
pirates
are
gathering

im
pointing
my
ship
the
other
way
the
pirates
are
gathering
to
fight
beckett

and
youre
a
pirate
fight
or
not

youre
not
running

jack
if
we
dont
stand
together

theyll
hunt
us
down
one
by
one

till
there
be
none
left
but
you
quite
like
the
sound
of
it
captain
jack
sparrow
the
last
pirate
aye

and
youll
be
fighting
jones
alone
how
does
that
figure
into
your
plan
im
still
working
on
that
but
i
will
not
be
going
back
to
the
locker

nay
count
on
that
why

we
can
still
use
them
as
clubs
effective

though
theres
a
freshwater
spring
on
this
island
we
can
resupply
there
and
get
back
to
shooting
each
other
later
you
lead
the
shore
party

ill
stay
with
my
ship
im
not
leaving
my
ship
in
your
command
why
dont
you
both
go
ashore
and
leave
the
ship
in
my
command
temporarily
criminy
odds
bodkins
careful
careful
you
stupid
fish
actually

its
a
cephalopod
youre
right

i
bet
people
will
pay
a
shilling
to
see
this
and
another
shilling
for
a
sketch
from
seeing
it
drop
slayers
we
could
a
slice
as
a
souvenir
still
thinking
of
running

jack
think
you
can
outrun
the
world
you
know

the
problem
with
being
the
last
of
anything
by
and
by

therell
be
none
left
at
all
sometimes
things
come
back

mate
were
living
proof

you
and
me
aye

but
thats
a
gamble
of
luck
now

aint
it
theres
never
a
guarantee
of
coming
back
passing
on

thats
dead
certain
summoning
the
brethren
court
then

is
it
its
our
only
hope
left
thats
a
sad
commentary
in
and
of
itself
the
world
used
to
be
a
bigger
place
the
worlds
still
the
same
theres
just
less
in
it
poisoned

fouled
by
the
body
aye

i
know
him
he
was
in
singapore
singapore
we
got
company
hes
the
captain
sao
feng
you
showing
up
here
it
is
truly
a
remarkable
coincidence
you
paid
me
great
insult
once
that
doesnt
sound
like
me
so
we
just
call
it
square
then
release
her
shes
not
part
of
the
bargain
and
what
bargain
be
that
you
heard
captain
turner
release
her
captain
turner
aye

the
perfidious
rotter
lead
a
mutiny
against
us
i
need
the
pearl
to
free
my
father
thats
the
only
reason
i
came
on
this
voyage
why
didnt
you
tell
me
you
were
planning
this
that
was
my
burden
to
bear
he
needs
the
pearl
captain
turner
needs
the
pearl
and
you
felt
guilty
and
you
and
your
brethren
court
did
no
one
come
to
save
me
just
because
they
missed
me
im
standing
over
there
with
him
im
sorry

jack
but
there
is
an
old
friend
who
wants
to
see
you
first
im
not
certain
i
can
survive
any
more
visits
from
old
friends
if
youre
so
jealous
to
find
out
curious
your
friends
appear
to
be
quite
desperate

jack
perhaps
they
no
longer
believe
that
a
gathering
of
squabbling
pirates
can
defeat
the
flying
dutchman
and
so
despair
leads
to
betrayal
but
you
and
i
are
no
strangers
to
betrayal
are
we
its
not
here

jack
what
what
isnt
the
heart
of
davy
jones

its
safely
aboard
the
dutchman
and
so
unavailable
for
you
sirs
leverage
to
satisfy
your
debt
to
the
good
captain
by
my
reckoning

that
account
has
been
settled
by
your
death
and
yet
here
you
are
close
your
eyes
and
pretend
its
all
a
bad
dream

thats
how
i
get
by
and
if
davy
jones
were
to
learn
of
your
survival
on
your
guard

men
my
men
are
crew
enough
company
ship

company
crew
he
agreed

the
black
pearl
was
to
be
mine
and
so
it
was
perhaps
you
consider
an
alternative
arrangement
one
which
requires
absolutely
nothing
from
you
but
information
regarding
the
brethren
court
no
doubt
in
exchange
for
fair
compensation
square
my
debt
with
jones
guarantee
my
freedom
of
course

its
just
good
business
were
i
in
a
divulgeatory
mood
what
then
might
i
divulge
everything
where
are
they
meeting
who
are
the
pirate
lords
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
nine
pieces
of
eight
beckett
agreed

the
black
pearl
wants
to
be
mine
lord
becketts
not
gonna
give
up
the
only
ship
as
can
outrun
the
dutchman

is
he
shame
that
youre
not
bound
to
honor
the
code
of
the
brethren

isnt
it
because
honors
a
hard
thing
to
come
by
nowadays
there
is
no
honor
to
remain
with
the
losing
side
leaving
it
for
the
winning
side
is
just
good
business
the
losing
side

you
say
they
have
the
dutchman
now
the
pearl
and
what
do
the
brethren
have
we
have
calypso
calypso
an
old
legend
the
goddess
herself

bound
in
human
form
imagine
all
the
power
as
you
see
is
brought
to
bear
against
our
enemy
i
intend
to
release
her
but
for
that
i
need
the
brethren
court
all
the
court
then
keep
barbosa
the
belligerent
homunculus
and
his
friend
with
the
wooden
eye

both
and
turner
especially
turner
the
rest
go
with
me
aboard
the
pearl

and
ill
lead
you
to
shipwreck
cove
where
i
will
hand
you
the
pirates

and
you
will
not
hand
me
to
jones
bloody
fair
deal

dont
you
think
and
what
becomes
of
miss
swann
what
interest
is
she
to
you
what
are
you
proposing

captain
what
be
accepted
captain
the
girl
ive
just
recalled
ive
got
this
wonderful
compass
which
points
to
whatever
i
want
so
for
what
do
i
need
you
elizabeth
is
not
part
of
any
bargain
it
was
not
a
question
point
you
to
the
thing
you
want
most
and
that
is
not
the
brethren
court

is
it
then
what
is

jack
dead
you
got
us
into
this
mess

if
this
is
what
frees
us

then
done
although
if
i
kill
you

then
i
can
use
the
compass
to
find
shipwreck
cove

is
it
on
my
own
cut
out
the
middleman

as
it
were
elizabeth

they
are
pirates
i
have
had
more
than
enough
experience
dealing
with
pirates
then
we
have
an
accord
with
me
killed

youd
arrive
at
the
cove
to
find
its
a
stronghold
nigh
impregnable
able
to
withstand
blockade
for
years
and
then
youd
be
wishing
oh

if
only
there
were
someone
i
had
not
killed
inside

to
ensure
that
the
pirates
then
come
outside
and
you
can
accomplish
all
this

can
you
you
may
kill
me

but
you
may
never
insult
me
who
am
i
im
captain
jack
sparrow
by
this
time
tomorrow

we
will
arrive
at
shipwreck
cove

and
you
will
be
free
not
a
name
you
fancy

id
imagine

out
of
the
many
that
you
have
but
it
is
what
we
call
you
we
being
who
you
confirm
it
confirm
what
youve
told
me
nothing

the
brethren
court

not
i
the
first
brethren
court
whose
decision
i
would
have
opposed
they
bound
you
to
human
form
so
the
rule
of
the
seas
would
belong
to
man
and
not
to
me
but
one
such
as
you
should
never
be
anything
less
than
what
you
are
pretty
speech
from
a
captor
but
words
whispered
through
prison
bars
lose
their
charm
can
i
be
blamed
for
my
efforts
all
men
are
drawn
to
the
sea

perilous
though
it
may
be
and
some
men
offer
desire
as
justification
for
their
crimes
i
offer
simply
my
desire
and
in
return
i
would
have
your
gifts

should
you
choose
to
give
them
and
if
i
should
choose
not
then
i
will
take
your
fury

here

her
with
this

losing
it

jack
every
step
i
make
for
my

a
step
away
from
elizabeth
mate

if
you
choose
to
love
your
heart
away

youll
lose
it
for
certain
if
i
might
lend

intellectual
thicket

all
to
give
up

beating
thing

your
father

a
ufo

aliens

ufo
crashlanded
in
new
mexico
a
body
may
have
been
recovered

have
been

there

a
terrible
mixup
it
was
thanksgiving
the
body
was
sent
down
to
the
kitchen
they
shoved
stuffing
up
its

and
we
ate
it
at
a
state
dinner
thats

that

a
feeling
ive

since
the
news

the
aliens
somethings
not

i
know
what
you

its
like
that
feeling
that
somethings

some
old
tupac

all
eyez
on
me

hey

this
shit
is
banging
thank
you

sir

i
appreciate
it
hello

cindy
i
am
the
architect
you
have
many
questions
ive
been
watching
you
for
a
very
long
time
so
i
see
what
is
the
connection
between
the
crop
circles
and
the
tape
the
answer
is
simple
you
are
the
eventuality
of
an
anomaly
you
are
inexorably
seeking
a
sedulant
probability
sedulant
grotesquerie
no
what
about
contingent
affirmation
thats
got
to
mean
something

hey
hey
you
put
cameras
in
my
bathroom
oh

my
god

well

it
was
a
long
winter
this
is
an
invasion
of
ow
oh

sorry
i
cant
help
it

its
very
ionely
in
here
ergo

i
havent
been
with
anyone
in
a
very
long
time
or
this
chair
i
call
her
linda
could
you
just
cut
to
the
chase
im
kind
of
in
a
rush
why
you
can
always
sleep
over
if
you
want
lindas
built
for
two

and
she
vibrates
stop
it
just
tell
me
what
i
need
to
know
who
is
that
little
girl
okay

okay
my
wife
and
i
wanted
a
child

but
she
couldnt
get
pregnant
neither
could
i
so
you
adopted
we
loved
our
daughter

but
she
was
evil
made
the
horses
crazy

killed
our
puppies
hid
the
remote
really
sick
shit
my
wife
took
her
to
the
old
family
farm
and
drowned
her
in
the
well
i
felt
a
simple
timeout
would
have
been
sufficient
but
tabitha
imprinted
her
evil
on
a
videotape
i
never
meant
for
it
to
get
out

but
but
what
i
put
it
in
the
wrong
box
and
returned
it
to
blockbuster
instead
of
my
copy
of
pootie
tang
its
been
circulating
and
killing
ever
since
just
like
pootie
tang
but
what
does
this
have
to
do
with
aliens
perhaps
tabithas
summoning
them
to
kill
us
all
an
alien
invasion
i
have
to
warn
the
world
its
already
begun

too
late

too
late

dr

do
you
know
me
should
i
i
wake
up

and
his
dead

i
wake
up

and
his
alive
different
things
around
me
all
the
time
that
i
cannot
explain
things
that
i
have
done
people
talking
to
me

people
who
know
me

but
i
have
never
met
people
like
me

yes
seems
a
little
complicated

tell
me
about
it
what
about
the
lithium
bottle
i
do
not
know

it
has

its

i
do
not
know

i
misplaced
it
somewhere
look
i
cannot
explain
it

but
i
thought
if
somebody
was
trying
to
trying
to

drug
you
unum
why
and
who
i
do
not
know

you
tell
me
i
did
not
prescribe
it

but
your
name
was
on
the
bottle
why
do
you
think
i
came
here
to
get
some
help
obviously

you
are
dealing
with
some
inconsistencies
i
wake
up
every
morning
to
find
my
husband
has
died
again
i
think
that
goes
just
a
little
beyond
inconsistent
how
do
you
feel
during
the
times
of
his
dead
i
mean

what
kind
of
emotions
run
trough
you
is
it
sorrow

resentment

relief
what
are
you
saying
that
is
a
common
daydream
to
imagine
people
being
death
i
am
not
daydreaming

okay

i
wake
up
and
he
is
dead
except
for
today
do
you
have
any
history
of
mental
illness
in
your
family
what
about
yourself

any
episodes
of
psychosis
memory
lost
judgment
lapses
i
do
not
want
him
dead
it
was
a
car
accident
well

it
is
not
a
crime
imagining
it

i
am
not
imagining
it
he
is
dead
well

it
is
a
little
odd
but
the
prescription
was
far
that
lift
you
because

thats
probably
the
best
thing
for
you
right
now
it
will
help
you
cope

you
think

it

woman

it
is
a
mess
i
do
not
know
if
it
is
so
bad
maybe
it
is
supposed
to
happen
what
do
you
mean
even
though
he
did
not
do
anything
yet
the
damage
that
it
would
have
cost
us

the
girls
maybe
it
was
enough
what
he
was
going
to
are
you
listening
to
what
you
are
saying
we
were
roommates

annie
we
were
roommates

two
girls
and
my
roommate
was
a
liar
well

as
far
as
you
mortgage

and
your
daughters
education
should
all
be
taken
care
of
you
know

linda
i
have
to
tell
you

the
timing
of
all
this
timing
what
do
you
mean

timing
jim
stopped
and
he
sees
me
on
wednesday
morning

right
before
wednesday
yes
and
he
seemed
very
anxious

like
he
was
not
quite
sure
of
things
and
he
kept
talking
about
you

and
the
girls

and
he
said
that
no
matter
what
happen

he
wanted
to
make
sure
you
are
all
okay
and
then
he
tripled
his
death
benefit
i
mean

it
is
on
no
problem
the
police
reports
all
confirm
that
it
was
an
accident

so
i
will
just
get
this
clear
to
the
main
office

and

i
should
have
a
check
for
you
very
soon

that
is
a
good
idea
you
girls
want
daddy
to
make
you
some
pancakes
for
breakfast
hello

father
linda
it
has
been
a
long
time
i
am
scared

father
a
dutch
trading
company
move
off
the
coast
of
carolina
a
hysterical
woman
claimed
to
have
walked
through
the
aftermath
of
a
terrible
hurricane
that
have
not
happen
yet
so

what
happened
they
hung
her
for
being
a
witch
two
days
later

the
entire
town
was
wiped
out
by
a
force
of
hurricane
it
is
awful
let
us
get
ahead
to
the
th
century
boston
at
the
height
of
the
influence
of
epidermis
a
father
told
a
friend
he
has
been
to
the
future
he
has
seen
a
grave
of
a
two
small
children
the
autopsy
showed
that
the
children
were
never
infected
he
shot
himself
a
week
later
who
are
these
people

why
did
it
happen
you
see
history
is
full
of
unexplained
phenomena
nobody
knows
why
some
people
thought

they
suffered
from
what
the
ancients
called
blasphemer
absence
fades
the
dangers
of
the
fatales
the
fatales
even
spiritual
people
who
have
lost
their
belief
they
are
like
empty
vessels
they
are
more
susceptible
of
having
their
life
taken
over
by
a
force
that
is
bigger
than
they
are
it
is
almost
like
a
curse
or
a
miracle
yeah

but
i
do
not
believe
in
miracles
every
day

we
are
alive
can
be
a
miracle
i
do
not
feel
that
right

not
for
me
something
bad
is
going
to
happen
i
need
your
help

i
need
your
direction

need
faith
faith

it
just
believes
something
behind
you
something
you
cannot
feel

or
smell

or
touch
like
hope

or
love
i
believe
i
have
let
that
all
go
maybe
you
should
try
to
get
it
back
again

huh
but
if
it
is
too
late
it
is
never
too
late

realize
what
is
important
in
your
life

fight
for
it

not
know
what
to
fight

somewhere
private
unless
you
need

do
jello
shots

was
johnnys
idea

i
just
went
along
how
does
reed
know
the
general
a
few
years
back

the
guy
was
pushing
a
new
missiledefense
system
reed
testified
that
the
technology
wouldnt
work
im
here
on
direct
orders
from
the
joint
chiefs
of
staff
personally

i
dont
like
sharing
sensitive
information
with
a
civilian
especially
one
who
enjoys
the
public
spotlight
so
much
always
a
pleasure
to
see
you
too

general
what
can
i
do
for
you
as
you
may
know

thereve
been
unusual
occurrences
officially

weve
downplayed
their
significance

but
were
concerned
these
anomalies
might
pose
a
credible
threat
to
our
national
security
these
were
taken
by
one
of
our
spy
satellites
three
days
ago
im
afraid
ive
never
seen
anything
like
it

ben
i
would
say
that
it
was
a
meteor

but
the
trails
all
wrong
its
giving
off
its
own
energy
take
a
look
at
this
these
have
been
appearing
in
remote
areas
throughout
the
world
field
personnel
estimate
its
diameter
to
be

meters
a
sensor
could
be
tied
into
the
baxter
buildings
satellite
grid
we
can
pinpoint
the
location
of
the
object
good

youll
build
the
sensor
for

your
ass
look
at
where
the
energy
levels
surge
when
he
attacks
me
there
see
what
happened
the
energy
was
channeled
through
him

but
it
originated
from
his
board
if
we
can
separate
him
from
the
board

we
can
cut
off
his
power
completely
thats
what
we
have
to
do

how

i
wouldnt
need
you

the

a
bad
dream

resulted
from
the
use

to
say
on
air
removing
the
head
or
destroying
the
brain

incredible
to
have
a
top
band
with
us

talking
about
their
work
for
the
charity
zombaid
the
fact
that
the
mobile
deceased
retained
their
primal
instincts
make
them
ideal
recruitment
for
the
service
industry
as
well
as
other
roles

it
a
crime
to
wear
fancy
clothes
and
an
expensive
diamond
pinky
ring
and
drive
a
cadillac
if
you
arrested
everyone
who
ever

the
fuck

klandis
is
representing
defendant
carlo
mascarpone
right
in

this
latin

translation

be
done

the
heavens
may
fall

have
the
fate
of
carlo
mascarpone
in
my
hands
there
he
is
sitting
near
his

this
courtroom

a
lifestyle
he
goes
to
st

lucys
church

his
wife

ccd
many
of
these
defendants
are
related

some
are
friends
or
neighbors
that
have
known
each
other
since
playing
little
league
baseball
together
they
are
a
family
not
the
kind
of
family
the
government
talks
about
they
would
twist
it

they
would
make
it
evil
but
all
were
asking
for

gentlemen
is
to
let
justice
be
done

the
heavens
may
fall

pro

of
uh

called
pro
se

im
gonna
defend
myself
mr

dinorscio

in
a
case
of
this
magnitude

i
dont
think

advisable
my
sixth
amendment
right
i
mean

i
got
the
right
to
defend
myself

am
i
correct

judge
yes

yeah

youre
correct

have
you
had
any
legal
experience
uh

well

sort
of
what
do
you
mean

sort
of
ive
been
in
prison
half
my
life
sometimes
i
think
i
had
too
much
legal
experience
mr

dinorscio

have
you
heard
the
saying
that
a
man
who
represents
himself
has
a
fool
for
a
client
now
i
have

is
it
true

judge
sometimes
it
is
so
that
means
sometimes
it
aint

right
thank
you

judge

but
i
dont
think
its
advisable

its
up
to
you
uh

mr

dinorscio

youre
on
hi

im
jackie
dinorscio
uh

im
defending
myself
in
this
case
youll
have
to
excuse
me

im
a
little
nervous
you
see

im
no
lawyer
i
only
have
a
sixthgrade
education
and

uh

im
not
sophisticated
in
the
law
like
some
of
these
other
persons
here
but
what
i
tell
you
will
come
from
the
heart
four
months
ago
we
started
to
pick
jurors
for
this
trial
and
i
wanna
say
right
now
that
im
satisfied
with
everybody
on
the
jury
and
i
wanna
thank
mr

klandis
for
translating
that
latin
slogan
in
front
of
the
judge
i
thought
it
meant
no
smoking
i
was
literally
about
to
light
up
like
i
said

uh
im
no
lawyer
uh

so
i
dont
know
where
they
came
up
with
this
rico
law
thing
should
probably
ask
mr

kierney

i
guess
if
youre
italian

you
should
be
in
prison
ive
read
the
rico
act

and
i
can
tell
you
its
more
appropriate
for
some
of
those
guys
over
in
washington
than
it
is
for
me
or
any
of
my
fellas
here
are
you
through

mr

dinorscio
uh

no

judge
how
do
i
look

good
chuckling
you
see
this
hat
im
wearing
this
hat
to
make
me
look
like
a
gangster
cause
thats
what
that
table
wants
me
to
be
a
gangster
but
im
not
a
gangster

ladies
and
gentlemen
im
a
gagster

this
aint
even
my
hat

kierney
will
tell
you
ive
been
in
jail
half
my
life

most
of
my
life
id
rather
go
to
jail
for
a
thousand
years
than
to
ever
rat
on
any
of
my
friends
do
you
know
that
this
government

me
a
deal
to

their
list
of

these
men

opening
statement
but

to
the
evidence

be
presented

the
clich�

never

hes
gonna
ask
a

or
hes
gonna
say
something
or

shithole
of
a
mouth
that
hes
got
and
were
gonna

you

im
not
sure
i
agree
i
was
stealing
looks
at
the
jury
they
were
with
him

they
were
laughing
with
him
so
let
me
throw
that
other
clich�
out
at
you
a
laughing
jury
is
never
a
hanging
jury
lets
sleep
on
this
wait
it
out
a
couple
of

it
a
laughing
jury
aint
a
hanging
jury
and
he
had
em
laughing

i
dont
agree
at
all

sean
laughing
at
him
can
indicate
disrespect
as
well
i
dont
know
if
you
noticed

but
a
couple
of
the
women
in
the
jury
looked
deeply
offended

the
line

agent
kerry
you
conducted
many
hours
of
surveillance
on
each
one
of
these
defendants
on
trial
here
today

correct
i
did
and
did
the
fbi

conclude
that
an
organized
crime
family
existed
in
northern
new
jersey
under
the
leadership
of
nick
calabrese
yes

that
is
correct
and
how
did
you
determine
that
calabrese
was
the
boss
well

i
was
in
a
restaurant
in
bloomfield
on
september

of
last
year
it
had
a
reputation
as
being
a
mob
hangout
why
did
it
have
that
reputation
jackie
because
the
food
was
good
no
interruptions
thank
you

your
honor

go
on

sir
i
was
at
the
bar

uh

you
could
see
a
large

private
dining
room
at
the
back
the
doors
were
open

and
two
very
well

heavyset
gentlemen
in
tuxedoes
stood
by
the
door
in
the
dining
room

you
could
see
a
birthday
party
was
going
on
how
did
you
know
it
was
a
birthday
party
they
were
all
wearing
paper
hats
and
they
had
those
things
that
when
you
blow
on
them
they
uncurl
and
go
hums
these
were
children
no

sir
no

sir

these
were
grown
men
go
on

well

at
the
head
of
a
horseshoe
table
sat

uh

mr

calabrese
and
as
i
observed

all
these
italian
males
lined
up
to
kiss
his
ring
chuckles
it
was
obvious
to
me
that
they
were
paying
respects
to
mr

calabrese
as
being
the
boss
it
was
like
out
of
the
movies

there
was
no
other
conclusion
thank
you

agent
kerry
mr

klandis
no
questions

your
honor
mr

novardis
coughing
i
have
nothing
for
this
witness

your

no
further
questions

id
like
to
ask
him
something
mr

dinorscio

thank
you

your
honor
mr

kerry

i
was
wondering
about
something

all
of
us
how
you
knew
that
those
men
in
that
restaurant

italian
well

looked
italian
to

the
hand
gestures
and
the
back
slapping
and
the

of
our
training

no
you

italian
no
could
you
hear
them
talking
in
italian
no

i
was
too
far
away

iim
not
understanding

from
the
back
slapping
and
the
kissing

knew
that
they
were
italian
well

it
was
an
italian
restaurant

they
all
have
black
hair

calabrese
at
the
head
of
the
table

what

jackie
jerkoff

dont
say
my
name
ever
again
you
say
my
name
again

ill
cut
your
fuckin
heart
out
ive
done
it
before

id
be
thrilled
to
do
it
again
jackie

what
what
the
fuck
do
you
think
youre
doing
up
there
what
i
speak
my
mind
you
can
kick
his
dog

you
can
spit
in
his
face
but
the
one
thing
a
judge
never
wants
to
hear
is
criticism
about
his
court
fuck
him

he
aint
the
jury

what
the
fuck
could
he
do
jackie

your
ignorance
is
second
only
to
your
arrogance
mr

klandis

how
do
you
think
mr

dinorscios
behavior
is
affecting
the
jurys
relationship
to
your
client
and
the
other
defendants
your
honor
dont
say
a
word

mr

dinorscio
not
a
word

mr

klandis
hes
clearly
a
disruptive
force
finestein
mr

kierney

he
undermines
the
authority
of
your
court
and
if
i
may
say
so

youd
never
permit
such
behavior
from
a
regular
attorney
sighs
see
any
solution
if
he
were
just
the
defendant

you
could
put
him
in
another
room

they
both
watch
it
on
tv
unfortunately

it
seems
to
me
theres
no
choice
he
has
to
be
severed
from
this
trial
and
tried
separately
finestein
mr

klandis
its
extreme

but
im
not
against
it
finestein
i
have
no
idea
what
the
legal
consequences
would
be
ill
put
my
clerk
to
work
on
it
all
right

we
ready
for
the
jury
judge

old
we

the
halfway
mark
in
our
presentation
mr

kierney

im
not
used
to
being
interrupted
you
are
the
one
who
handed
in
a
witness
list
of
more
than

people
and
you
have
already
introduced
more
than

exhibits
and
i
am
told
there
are
hundreds
more
coming
so
let
us
not
complain
about
a
lengthy
trial
a
defendant
is
sick
and
he
is
gonna
get
a
fair
shake
in
my
courtroom

understood
the
clerk
will
notify
you
about
our
next
meeting

have
a
good
night

gentlemen

you
like
that

what
fleeting

time
is
fleeting
what
the
hell
does
that
mean

time
is
fleeting
whats
fleeting
fleeting

its
like
fleeing

time
is
fleeing
but
its
in
the
past
tense

so
they
say

youre
full
of
shit
youre
an
ignorant
slob
you

shes
tough

boy

is
she
tough
you
know
what
the
two
best
words
in
the
english
language
are
things
change
okay

first

about
mr

dinorscio
because
hes
both
a
defendant
and
an
attorney
i
think
separating
him
out
at
this
point
will
make
an
appeal
by
the
losing
side
almost
inevitable
anyone
wanna
go
through
this
again
no

so
he
stays
but
i
promise
you
this

mr

dinorscio
if
you
are
as
disruptive
as
you
have
been
in
the
past
you
are
out
like
that

snaps
fingers
and
to
hell
with
what
happens
later
you
got
me
second

trial
resumes
on
monday

ive
spoken
with
the
doctors
they
feel
mr

napoli
is
fully
capable
of
understanding
the
proceedings
around
him
your
honor

he
cant
even
sit
up
arrange
for
his
hospital
bed
to
be
brought
into
the
courtroom
your
honor

hes
under
heavy
medication
the
doctors
are
cutting
it
way
back
this
weekend
he
falls
asleep
when
i
talk
to
him

make
yourself
more
interesting
now

look

goddamn
it

were
a
year
in
this
trial
is
going
forward

monday


am
hey

theres
tommy
napoli
im
glad
to
see
youse
guys

look
at
these
shoes
nappy
napoli
cant
rise

is
it
all
right
if
he
stays
layin
down
be
seated
you
can
see
their
autos
parked
here
near
the
entrance
there
are
two
lincolns
and
one

two

three
cadillacs
as
well
as
other
vehicles
parked
nearby
we
continued
our
surveillance
until
mr

mascarpone
and
mr

roma
got
in
their
cars
and
left
nine
hours
later
at

am
agent
petraki

when
you
arrested
my
client

carlo
mascarpone
did
he
resist
in
any
way
no
i
had
a
very
pleasant
conversation
with
mr

mascarpone
and
what
did
you
talk
about
we
discussed
political
philosophy
and
history
i
found
out
that
he
was
a
great
admirer
of
machiavelli
so
you
discussed
machiavelli

no
discussions
of
shakedowns

payoffs
or
rubouts

correct
thats
correct

but
since
i
once
taught
a
class
in
political
philosophy
i
thought
it
ironic
that
carlo
mascarpone
was
an
admirer
of
machiavelli
whose
major
theme
was
that
power
corrupts
and
absolute
power
corrupts
absolutely
i
felt
that
perhaps
mr

mascarpone
applied
machiavellis
ideas
to
his
own
line
of
work
as
a
mob
boss
your
honor

my
next
line
of
questioning
could
take
some
time
its
so
close
to
lunch

would
anybody
object
if
we
took
an
hour
now
any
objections
one
hour
do
you
see
this
book
its
called
bartletts
familiar
quotations
do
you
know
who
lord
acton
was
lord
acton
acton

acton
no

sir

well

he
was
english
he
lived
from

to
thats

years
after
machiavelli
and
its
right
here
on
page


it
says
lord
acton
is
the
author
of
the
quote
power
corrupts
and
absolute
power
corrupts
absolutely
not
machiavelli

murmuring
no
further
questions

your
honor
mr

petraki

you
was
a
college
teacher
yes
now

in
those
courses
that
you
taught
in
what
was
it

politics
machiavellis
a
big
deal

am
i
right
a
very
big
deal
i
mean

were
not
talking
about
a
made
guy
in
the
lucchese
family
so

my
question
is
how
could
you
make
a
mistake
like
that
i
mean

youre
this
educated
guy

right
and
a
lot
of
us

most
of
us

didnt
even
get
through
high
school
except
maybe
carlo
so
your
testifying
here
can
hurt
us
do
you
see
what
im
saying
it
was
just
an
honest
mistake
what
else
was
an
honest
mistake
you
said
earlier
that
it
was
a
lincoln
you
said
they
spent
nine
hours
could
that
be
a
caddy
could
that
be
a
mercury
could
that
be
a
buick
you
said
they
spent
nine
hours

maybe
they
spent
three
maybe
you
dont
know
what
the
hell
youre
talking
about

mr

petraki
i
prepared
him

sean

its
my
fuckup

i
feel
like
hell
dont
worry
about
it

got
compagna
coming

our
clincher

what
happens
when
jackie
crossexamines
him

guinea
versus

in

seconds

jackie
dee
will
be
screaming
at
him

i
guarantee
it
and

my
motion

objection
objection
finestein

then

mr

compagna

if
you
were
involved
in
crimes
with
your
cousin
and
the
other
defendants
why
did
you
shootjackie
dinorscio
well

you
see

i
was
in
the
gem
business
with
jackie
we
used
to
get
suckers
to
invest
in
colored
gemstones
and
when
they
went
to
sell
them

they
found
out
they
werent
worth
all
that
much
we
was
doin
good

jackie
was
the
closest
person
in
the
world
to
me
at
that
point
and
what
changed
all
that
jackie
started
stealing
from
the
company
little
by
little

the
business
went
downhill

finally
it
went
bust
i
was
without
a
job

pretty
soon
out
of
money
uh

jackie
had
other
businesses
going

he
could
have
got
me
work
that
way
i
turned
to
him
for
help

he
wont
even
help
me
he
wont
even
talk
to
me
so

one
morning

i
headed
forjackies
house
i
was
mad
atjackie

i
was
i
was
desperate
can
you
describe
what
happened
next
i
went
into
his
room
i
wasnt
even
thinking
i
ran
into
his
room
and
i
shot
him
i
was
scared

i
ran
out
and
then
what
happened
uh

i
was
picked
up
by
the
cops
a
couple
days
later
when
they
charged
me
with
attempted
murder

thats
when
i
knew
jackie
was
still
alive
i
was
scared

and
then
what
a
detective
comes
in

and
he
says

okay

you
can
go
jackie
just
signed
a
statement
says
you
didnt
got
nothing
to
do
with
the
shooting
so
thats
when
i
knew

knew
what

mr

compagna
the
boys
didnt
want
me
in
jail
at
all
jackie
wanted
me
back
out
on
the
street
so
they
could
deal
with
me
in
their
own
way
so
thats
when
i
went
to
the
fbi

and
agreed
to
cooperate
thank
you

mr

compagna
your
witness
mr

compagna

isnt
it
true
that
you
had
undergone
psychiatric
and
electric
shock

this
period

your

if

no
further
questions

thats
it
for
the
day
kierney
twentyone
months
sometimes
sometimes
i
get
up
to
pee
in
the
wee
small
hours
and
i
cant
get
back
to
sleep
thats
never
happened
to
me
before
now
well
hear
the
closing
arguments

mr

kierney
i
wanna
congratulate
you
on
entering
the
guinness
book
of
world
records
youre
part
of
the
longest
criminal
trial
in
american
history
im
not
proud
of
that
i
know
its
put
enormous
strain
on
all
concerned
but
from
all
these
details
a
collective
power
emerges
if
you
walk
away
with
only
one
impression
from
these

months
let
it
be
this
the
men
you
see
before
you
have
engaged
in
all
sorts
of
criminal
activities
for
decades

decades
with
utter
disregard
for
the
law
and
they
deserve
to
be
punished
by
society
for
these
crimes
now
the
defense
will
try
to
distract
you
from
this
undeniable
fact
by
complaining
that
the
prosecution
witnesses
are
junkies

crooks
strongarm
guys
and
worse
well

maybe
some
of
them
are

but
these
defendants
if
they
know
any
honest
citizens
never
have
any
dealings
with
them
now

weve
had
our
share
of
big
personalities
in
this
trial
i
ask
you
not
to
let
personalities
play
any
part
here
but
that
you
focus
specifically
on
the
overwhelming
physical
evidence
that
has
been
presented
i
thank
you
for
your
time
and
i
thank
you
for
your
patience
in
performing
your
duty
as
lawabiding
citizens
even
to
a
point
where
his
health
broke
down

was
there
a
direct
connection
how
many
of
you
could
have
gone
through
with
this
trial
how
many
times
was
he
named
in
this
trial
twice

twice
in
a
year
and

months
has
my
client
been
in
jail
yes

but
have
we
reached
a
point
under
the
rico
act
where
we
indict
a
man
for
past
crimes
hes
already
done
time
for
i
representjimmy
katz

youve
heard
him
referred
to
as
jimmy
thejew
how
come
the
government
had
one
defendant
whose
name
did
not
end
in
a
vowel
ill
tell
you
how
come
gino
mascarpone
is
being
persecuted
because
his
name
ends
in
a
vowel
ladies
and
gentlemen

the
prosecution
took
great
pains
to
point
out
that
my
client
and
his
friends
knew
the
sordid
array
of
misfits
they
used
as
witnesses
they
want
you
to
believe
that
these
men
spent
their
lives
with
the
criminal
element
you
saw
in
this
courtroom
i
wanna
offer
you
a
different
part
of
carlo
mascarpones
life
and
im
sure
the
lives
of
these
other
defendants
as
well
wife

children
his
priest

his
md
the
guy
who
pumps
his
gas
and
inspects
his
car
for
him
in
other
words

the
hundredodd
people
whose
lives
he
touches
every
day

every
week
leading
a
life
very
much
like
yours
the
government
brought
you
witnesses
government
informants

who

because
of
the
lives
they
have
led
have
lost
the
ability
to
tell
the
difference
between
truth
and
lies
these
highlypaid
informants
came
to
the
government
in
various
ways
but
there
is
one
constant
they
all
came
in
handcuffs
the
government
does
not
like
these
defendants
they
dont
like
the
neighborhood
they
come
from
they
dont
like
the
way
they
talk
they
dont
like
their
tradition

their
culture
but
we
are
a
nation
of
laws

not
men
the
purpose
of
the
prosecutor

much
like
the
purpose
of
the
grand
jury
is
to
search
for
truth
but
somehow
in
this
case
that
was
lost
the
prosecutor
became
the
persecutor
win
at
any
cost
i
thank
you
all
for
your
time
and
now
i
pass
my
clients
fate
into
your
hands
phone
call

jackie
yeah
uh

wonderin
how
youre
doin
oh

hiya

your
fault
and

the
whole
trial

you

a
lot
to
me
coming
from
you
all
right

okay
ill

you
tomorrow

good
night

jackie
ladies
and
gentlemen

i
wont
take
up
too
much
more
of
your
time
its
been
a
long
trial

and
i
dont
want
you
to
be
away
from
your
families
any
longer
than
you
have
to
i
realize
i
said
a
lot
of
things
in
this
courtroom
and
i
hope
i
didnt
offend
nobody
but
i
just
wanted
to
show
you
that
im
not
a
gangster

im
just
a
gagster
im
not
gonna
read
from
this
i
promised
you
a
long
time
ago
i
would
speak
from
the
heart
now

i
know
the
government
tried
piling
up
all
this
evidence
in
front
of
you
they
showed
you
photos

and
you
think
its
me
and
my
friends
meeting
together
its
probably
some
kind
of
criminal
conspiracy
you
see
this
picture
you
recognize
that
one
in
the
middle
thats
me
the
rest
of
the
guys
are
some
of
these
men
here
as
children
this
was

of
course

way
long
before
the
government
ever
knew
whojackie
dinorscio
was
who
was
standing
on
a
corner
outside
of
an
icecream
parlor
and
you
know
what
we
were
doing
that
day
we
were
conspiring
to
buy
ice
cream
if
they
had
a
rico
law
back
then

they
probably
would
have
locked
us
up
now

i
know
its
its
tough
to
decide
who
to
believe
in
this
case
for

days

you
guys
have
been
sittin
here
they
came
in
with
tape
after
tape

witness
after
witness
and
they
were
trying
to
fill
your
mind
with
so
much
baloney
that
in
the
end
youd
think

oh

god

theres
so
much
there
there
has
to
be
something
to
it
if
you
believe
anything
that
any
of
those
witnesses
has
said
or
if
you
feel
that
the
prosecutor
was
right
then
i
beg
you
please

dont
take
it
out
on
my
friends
here
if
you
have
to
blame
someone
then
find
me
guilty
you
heard
me
right
find
me
guilty

and
let
these
men
go
home
to
their
families
you
see

i
already
lost
mine
and
i
dont
want
their
kids
to
lose
their
fathers
cause
of
unclejackie
so

not
guilty

im
used
to
it

nothing

time

bit
gray
yeah

nice
to
see
you
too
welcome
back

captain

were
clean
lets
make
sure
of
that

i
hate
getting
scanned
its
probably
worse
for
us
than
the
phantoms
these
machines
are
suspected
of
causing
sterility
i
want
to
have
a
little
neil
jr

someday
thats
a
spooky
thought

quit
busting
my
chops
lets
just
do
this
thing
yes

sir

yes

sir
okay

next
youve
gained
weight
its
upperbody
strength

get
a
girlfriend
im
working
on
it
my
security
rating
allows
me
to
bypass
this
not
today
it
doesnt
somethings
not
right
about
this
mission
or
that
woman
both
next
listen

i
think
i
dont
care
what
you
think
youre
getting
scanned
just
like
everybody
else
shit
they
got
him
there
must
be
a
mistake
you
came
in
contact
with
a
phantom
administering
treatment
shield
what
level
blue

code
red
in

l
minutes
we
have
to
treat
him
impossible

well
transfer
him
to
the
treatment
center
theres
no
time
for
that
get
him
to
the
table
hang
in
there

captain
locating
pathogens
jesus

look
at
that
thing
how
much
time
not
enough

when
he
reaches
code
red

the
shield
wont
hold
engaging
bioetheric
laser
what
whered
it
go
what
is
going
on
weve
lost
contact

infestation
is
moving
deeper
tracking

theres
no
time
tracking

youll
lose
him
his
treatment
shield
is
failing
found
it
youll
be
back
to
normal
in
no
time
doctor

we
need
to
scan
you
for
infestation
that
wont
be
necessary

ill
take
responsibility
hey

doc
thanks
for
saving
him
are
you
all
right
the
military
impounded
my
ship
whats
with
her
whats
with
her
and
the
captain
whats
with
her
and
that
stupid
plant
forward
me
everything
regarding
the
five
spirits
collected
yes

doctor
i
thought
we
werent
supposed
to
use
the
s
word
dont
get
smart
with
me
now
lets
see
if
that
plant
does
the
trick
its
a
match

weve
found
it
the
sixth
spirit
you
broke
nearly
every
protocol
how
long
do
you
think
this
would
have
survived
outside
there
are
elements
in
the
council
and
military
waiting
to
shut
us
down
look


years
ago

who
discovered
this
energy
in
the
phantoms
you
and
who
proved
the
same
energy
source
existed
in
humans
and
every
life
form
you

you
made
it
possible
to
harness
that
energy
for
ovopacs

scanners

the
barrier
the
council
knows

they
trust
you

were
so
close
to
proving
it
but
we
still
need
these
parts
two
more
pieces
and
weve
solved
the
puzzle
we
need
to
be
free
to
find
those
pieces
i
want
to
show
you
something
what
is
this
read
all
life
is
born
of
gaia
and
each
life
has
a
spirit
each
new
spirit
is
housed
in
a
body
through
their
experiences
on
earth

each
spirit
matures
and
grows
when
the
physical
body
dies
the
mature
spirit

enriched
by
life
on
earth

returns
to
gaia
bringing
with
it
the
experiences
enabling
gaia
to
live
and
grow
its
my
old
diary
i
wrote
that

years
ago

when
i
was
the
age
you
are
now
dr

sid
remember
galileo
they
threw
him
in
jail
because
he
said
the
earth
was
not
the
center
of
the
universe
that
could
happen
to
us
our
ideas
are
unpopular

aki
if
you
have
any
notes
that
could
be
used
against
you
destroy
them
keep
them
up
here

right
and
stay
away
from
the
captain
he
saves
your
life

you
save
his

this
leads
to
that
i
was
young
once
doctor

there
is
a
war
going
on
no
ones
young
anymore
members
of
the
council
could
you
please
explain
why
zeus
was
completed
a
month
ago
if
we
attack
the
meteor

we
will
eliminate
the
phantoms
at
the
source
general
hein

calm
down
we
voted

to
to
postpone
using
the
zeus
cannon
to
attack
the
leonid
meteor
id
like
to
ask
the
director
of
the
bioetheric
center
to
speak
dr

sid

please

thank
you
the
phantoms
nest
is
in
the
leonid
meteor
that
landed
here

years
ago
what
you
see
now
are
the
records
of
every
assault
on
the
meteor
physical
attacks
have
had
utterly
no
effect
this
took
place
three
months
ago
during
a
fullscale
bombardment
please
note
the
phantoms
outside
the
meteor
are
destroyed
however

inside

many
that
were
dormant
come
to
life
and
as
you
see

overall
phantom
density
remains
the
same
the
newly
risen
aliens
respond
to
the
attack
by
burrowing
deeper
into
the
earth
this
is
very
interesting
to
me
because
we
see
the
same
thing
during
surgery
when
using
bioetheric
lasers
on
phantom
particles

do
we
not
the
injured
particles
escape
digging
themselves
deeper
into
a
patients
body
when
we
increase
the
laser
power
to
destroy
these
deeper
particles
we
have
had
incidents
of
further
injury
to
a
patient
and
in
some
cases
death
what
exactly
does
that
mean
it
means
theres
a
very
good
chance
the
beam
from
the
zeus
cannon
will
burn
the
phantoms
exactly
thank
you
however

it
also
means
that
the
beam
energy
may
be
too
strong
injuring
the
earth
injure
the
earth
you
mean
the
gaia
i
mean
you
mean
the
spirit
of
the
earth
yes

the
spirit
of
the
earth
did
he
say
what
i
think
he
said
i
know
what
im
doing

keep
your
mouth
shut
with
all
due
respect
did
you
come
here
to
talk
about
some
gaia
theory
to
tell
us
that
the
planet
is
alive
that
it
has
a
spirit
thats
a
fairy
tale

we
dont
have
time
it
is
not
a
fairy
tale

it
is
true
so
if
i
point
a
gun
at
the
earth
and
fire
lm
not
just
making
a
hole

im
killing
the
planet
the
gaia
theory
has
not
been
proven
even
if
gaia
does
exist

wont
we
still
have
to
remove
the
phantoms
if
theres
a
chance
of
success

we
should
take
it
dont
you
agree
of
course
but
there
is
an
alternative
to
the
space
cannon
another
method
a
means
of
disabling
the
phantoms

please
as
we
know

the
aliens
display
a
distinct
energy
pattern
it
is
a
fact
that
two
opposing
bioetheric
waves
placed
one
over
the
other
cancel
each
other
out
it
is
theoretically
possible
to
make
a
wave
pattern
in
opposition
to
the
phantom
energy
we
are
assembling
such
a
wave
and
are
near
completion
members
of
the
council
gathering
plants
and
animals
to
fight
the
phantoms
is
utter
nonsense
the
zeus
cannon
is
a
proven

effective
weapon
it
will
kill
phantoms
can
we
afford
to
wait
for
some
crazy
invention
some
army
of
touchyfeely
plants
and
animals
that
offers
no
evidence
that
it
will
destroy
the
aliens
there
is
evidence
our
partially
completed
energy
wave
has
stopped
phantom
particles
from
spreading
through
an
infected
patient
do
you
have
evidence
that
a
terminal
patient
was
cured
not
cured

the
wave
is
not
complete
weve
succeeded
in
containing
the
particles
safely
inside
the
patient
where
is
the
proof
you
may
have
bought
us
some
time

but
at
what
cost
i
want
what
life
i
have
left
to
mean
something
when
we
find
the
seventh
and
eighth
spirits
if
we
find
them

what
we
need
now
is
luck
luck
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
faith
and
hard
work

girl
because
ill
be
damned
if
youre
going
to
die
before
me
the
council
decided
to
postpone
firing
the
zeus
cannon
i
guess
i
put
on
a
good
show
mind
if
i
tag
along
youll
probably
get
bored
so

what
are
you
doing
oh

i
see

youre
giving
me
the
silent
treatment
im
scanning
the
city
for
the
seventh
spirit
hurry
up

neil
almost
got
it

what
are
you
doing
were
gonna
strand
them
for
a
while
hey

it
was
his
idea
this
was
your
idea
were
just
helping
the
captain
out
wheres
your
sense
of
romance
youve
seen
how
the
captain
looks
at
her
its
amore

baby
whats
going
on
its
probably
just
a
glitch
listen

aki
im
still
mad
at
you
youre
mad
leaving
your
helmet
on
not
telling
me
who
you
were

that
doesnt
seem
a
bit
childish
i
was
upset
when
you
left
for
the
zeus
station
without
a
word
now
you
know
what
was
going
on

now
i
know
my
operation
had
to
be
done
in
zero
grav
i
was
there
on
a
job
and
you
wouldnt
even
see
me
i
was
probably
collecting
spirit
waves
now
i
know

im
sorry
well

me
too
were
both
sorry
will
you
tell
me
about
them
about
what
about
the
spirits
youve
collected
i
was
infected
by
a
phantom
during
an
experiment
normally

no
one
could
have
survived

how
did
you
dr

sid
created
a
membrane
around
the
infection

keeping
me
alive
so
the
first
spirit
wave
was
me
the
second
was
a
fish

a
fish
the
third
was
a
deer
i
found
in
a
wildlife
preserve
outside
moscow
the
fourth
was
a
bird
ever
tried
to
track
a
sparrow
from
outer
space
its
no
fun
and
then
there
was
that
plant
i
collected
from
times
square
i
thought
that
was
number
six

what
you
skipped
one
the
fifth
was
a
little
girl
dying
in
a
hospital
emergency
room
i
retrieved
the
sample
in
time

but
she
i
told
her
everything
had
a
spirit
dogs

cats

trees

little
girls
even
the
earth
i
told
her
she
wasnt
dying

but
returning
to
the
earths
spirit
to
gaia
she
told
me
that
she
was
ready
to
die
she
said
i
didnt
have
to
make
up
stories
to
make
her
feel
better
only

years
old
and
ready
to
die
i
have
work
to
do

i
have
to
find
the
seventh
and
eighth
spirits
dont

please
you
dont
believe
any
of
this

do
you
i
just
dont
know

aki
is
this
why
you
shut
me
out
you
should
have
told
me
i
dont
know
how
much
time
i
have
left
who
does
i
better
get
back
to
scanning
captain
edwards
you
extracted
a
dr

ross
from
old
new
york
several
days
ago
yes

sir

what
were
your
impressions
of
her
she
seemed
very
capable
and
determined

sir
you
and
the
deep
eyes
are
being
temporarily
reassigned
you
will
guard
dr

ross
when
she
reenters
the
wasteland
understood

sir

you
dont
understand
yet

captain
report
any
aberrant
behavior
in
dr

ross
to
the
major
immediately
aberrant
behavior
she
carries
an
alien
infestation

we
dont
know
what
its
doing
to
her
it
might
affect
her
judgment
they
may
be
manipulating
her
is
the
general
suggesting
that
dr

ross
is
a
spy
the
general
is
wondering
why
hes
explaining
himself
to
a
captain
shes
had
prolonged
exposure
to
phantom
tissue
if
this
begins
to
manifest
itself
she
is
to
be
placed
under
arrest
and
transported
here
for
observation
it
is

in
fact

for
her
own
good
of
course

sir
major

send
some
of
our
men
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
good
captain
im
convinced
these
dreams
are
some
form
of
communication
the
message
still
eludes
me
but
theyre
coming
faster
now
and
that
can
only
mean
one
thing
the
phantoms
inside
me
are
beginning
to
win
our
target
is

klicks
west
of
tucson
phantom
concentration
not
good

weve
got
big
metas
everywhere
its
gonna
be
a
real
picnic
stick
close

no
heroics
today

everything
by
the
book
by
the
book

right
if
we
drop
energy
buoys
here

here
and
here
we
can
acquire
the
target
and
get
out
before
they
know
we
were
there
the
buoys
attract
the
phantoms
yeah

for
a
while
youre
from
the
th
under
general
hein
ever
done
wasteland
recon
before
it
can
get
pretty
ugly
captain

rendezvous
for
evac
at
vector


coordinate
roger

stay
alert
for
hostiles
looks
like
theyve
taken
the
bait
the
seventh
spirit
should
be
just
beyond
that
line
of
wreckage
how
could
any
living
thing
survive
here
well
find
out
soon
enough
this
was
the
phantom
cleansing
mission
it
was
supposed
to
end
the
war
my
fathers
in
here
somewhere
lets
move
out

people
a
survivor
whats
it
doing
out
here
hoping
for
life
to
return
is
that
our
spirit

doc
were
closing
in
on
the
life
form
distance
hard
to
say

were
very
close
i
dont
see
anything
youre
not
gonna
tell
me
its
him
thats
impossible
its
his
ovopac
how
the
pacs
power
our
weapons

the
barrier
cities
its
just
bioetheric
energy
to
create
that
energy
we

that

over
well
with
the
council
what
a
tragedy
that
would
be
this
is
perfect

the
good
captain
has
opened
the
door
for
us
the
council
will
be
at
our
feet
thanking
us
for
exposing
the
traitors
and
imploring
us
to
save
them
from
the
phantoms
how
is
she

doctor
she
is
dying

there
must
be
something
you
can
do
aki
is
fighting
with
only
six
of
the
spirits
well
have
to
implant
the
seventh
directly
into
her
chest
plate
i
think
it
might
be
damaged
we
have
to
repair
this
panel
quickly
her
vital
signs
are
dropping

aki
is
slipping
away
from
us
she
needs
a
sympathetic
spirit
to
help
hold
her
in
this
world
i
can
think
of
none
better
suited
for
that
task
than
yours

captain
i
dont
understand

you
dont
have
to
understand
you
just
be
with
her
now
you
keep
her
here
with
us
aki
where
are
we
on
an
alien
planet
how
is
that
possible
im
not
entirely
sure
you
seem
pretty
calm
ive
been
having
this
dream
every
night
for
months
dream
well

whatever
it
is
youre
really
here

arent
you
whats
happening
to
me
sid
is
implanting
the
seventh
spirit
directly
into
your
body
then
youre
my
spiritual
support
gray

how
sweet
of
you
look

i
dont
think
you
realize
how
serious
this
situation
is
something
you
should
see
here

sir
and
i
am
watching
what

major
it
seems
dr

ross
has
been
recording
her
dreams
and
why
would
i
be
interested
in
her
dreams
this
is
it

this
is
our
evidence
shes
under
the
influence
of
the
phantoms
the
dreams
should
be
all
the
council
needs
to
authorize
the
zeus
cannon
the
council
is
content
to
hide
inside
this
barrier
while
the
world
dies
more
every
day
they
need
a
push
in
the
right
direction
get
together
a
group
of
your
most
trusted
men
why
are
they
staring
at
us
not
at
us
welcome
back

captain
is
it
over
how
is
she

doctor
shell
be
fine

but
this
is
temporary
well
need
to
find
the
eighth
and
final
spirit
to
cure
her
aki

can
you
hear
me
i
finished
it
i
know
what
it
means
i
know
what
the
phantoms
really
are
nobody
move
youre
all
under
arrest
we
have
them

sir
my
wife
and
daughter
were
killed
by
phantoms
in
the
san
francisco
barrier
city
did
i
ever
tell
you
that
i
try
to
imagine
what
that
must
have
been
like
seeing
everyone
around
you
fall
over
dead
for
no
apparent
reason
and
then

at
the
end

feeling
something
next
to
you
invisible
touching
you
reaching
inside
your
body
youve
lost
family

havent
you
thats
why
i
trust
you
all
of
you
you
know
what
must
be
done
security
override
perimeter
breach
major

arrest
these
men
take
it
easy

stand
up

go
you
are
relieved
of
your
post

dont
ask
questions
reduce
power
to
sector
what
i
realize
is
we
must
force
the
council
to
take
action
of
energy
pipe
alpha
redirected
lowering
power
output
to
sector
barrier
breach
in
sector


theyre
coming
through
now
we
can
handle
a
few
phantoms
in
a
contained
space
relax

major

when
this
nights
over

youre
going
to
be
a
hero
i
dont
but
you
saw
it
im
not
sure
what
i
saw

how
can
you
be
captain

please

let
her
continue
why
do
you
think
weve
never
been
able
to
determine
a
relationship
between
the
human
sized
phantoms
and
the
giant
ones
excuse
me

doc

but
what
frigging
relationship
you
got
your
humansized
phantoms

creepy
caterpillary
phantoms
flying
phantoms
and
my
favorite
down

boy
if
youve
spent
time
in
the
field
you
know
there
is
no
relationship

its
like
a
zoo
out
there
i
think
the
giant
ones
are
like
our
whales
or
elephants
but
why
would
an
invading
army
bring
whales
and
elephants
along
unless
their
ship
was
a
crazy
noahs
ark
we
have
always
assumed
that
the
meteor
was
intended
as
a
form
of
transportation

perhaps
not
the
meteor
is
a
chunk
of
their
planet
that
got
thrown
into
space
when
they
destroyed
their
world
but
how
could
they
survive
the
trip
across
outer
space
they
didnt
this
makes
a
creepy
kind
of
sense
what
do
you
think
i
think
that
explains
why
we
never
had
a
chance
all
our
strategies
are
based
on
one
assumption
that
we
were
fighting
alien
invaders
think
of
the
dream

gray

how
they
died
since
then

all
theyve
known
is
suffering
theyre
not
an
invading
army
theyre
ghosts
how
many
phantoms
more
than
enough
to
convince
the
council
excellent

sound
an
alert

send
a
squad
out
to
eliminate
them
alert
status

full
deployment
i
have
numerous
phantom
contacts
of
course
you
do
outside
of
sector

and
moving
at
incredible
speed
what
the
hell
is
going
on
theyre
in
the
pipes
theyre
moving
with
the
bioetheric
energy
flow
thats
impossible

nothing
could
survive
in
those
pipes
weve
got
a
big
one
heading
this
way

meta
class

sir
hold
your
fire
what
have
i
done
come
on

neil

we
need
a
way
out

youre
our
man

think
these
walls
are
titanium
alloy
and
the
bars
are
pulsesonic
lasers
its
not
like
i
can
just
wave
a
magic
wand
and
neil

im
impressed

that
makes
two
of
us
proceed
to
the
nearest
evacuation
facility
we
should
proceed
to
the
nearest
evacuation
facility
here
they
come

but
the
others
dr

sid
deep
eyesll
take
care
of
him
why
can
we
see
them
now
they
must
be
carrying
a
residual
charge
from
the
barrier
behind
you
all
aboard

captain
we
need
to
find
my
ship
if
it
was
towed
here

it
would
be
in
the
military
hangar
thats
a
big
if
look
out

the
station

all
due
respect
excuse
me

captain

the
station

going
through

the
only
way

a
rough
ride
youve
got
a
talent
for
understatement
hang
on

everybody
doc
interesting
anybody
hurt
captain

a
problem

impound
tractor

the
ship
can
you
disengage
from
the
cockpit
permission
to
go
outside
and
detach
the
coupling

it
theres
the
problem
the
controls

locked

naturally
you
think
well
get
out
of
here
alive
i
wonder
if
anybody
else
has
gotten
out
you
think
anyones
made
it
this
far

this
eighthspirit
stuff
work
against
the
phantoms
what
if
its
all
mumbojumbo
can
we
stop
talking
im
trying
to
concentrate
here
whats
happening
down
there
nothing
we
cant
handle
neil

whats
your
status
almost
there
get
back
inside
were

jane

captain
yes

are
good
to
go
jane

get
out
of
there
get
out
of

go
jane
get
the
hell
out
of
there
the
shield
is
powered
and
ready
where
are
you
going
to
the
cockpit
were
in
countdown
to
liftoff
no

wait

its
too
dangerous

aki
over
here

you
son
of
a
bitch
gray

do
you
read
me
whats
happening
you
and
sid
are
getting
out
of
here
now
no
we
cant
just
leave
everyone

everyones
dead
im
not
leaving
without
you

sorry

but
you
dont
have
a
choice
goodbye

aki
gray

come
on
i
just
i
wish
i
could
believe
they
were
in
a
better
place
i
enlarged
the
scanning
perimeter
to
include
an
area
that
we
had
previously
overlooked
the
impact
crater
strange
place
to
find
the
eighth
spirit
yes

really
quite
astonishing
but
nothing
could
survive
in
there
except
phantoms
precisely
which
suggests
that
the
eighth
spirit
is
a
phantom
spirit
i
cant
explain
it
at
the
moment

but
once
we
get
down
there
you
will
understand
wait

doctor

thats
a
oneway
trip
yes

i
expected
thats
how
you
would
evaluate
our
chances
well

am
i
wrong
no

i
agree

we
probably
wont
live
long
enough
to
extract
the
eighth
spirit
from
the
crater
then
why
even
try
it
because
we
dont
need
to
extract
the
eighth
spirit
if
we
cant
bring
the
final
spirit
here
we
can
go
there
and
complete
the
wave
inside
the
crater
yes

exactly
and
how
do
we
do
that

exactly
i
can
construct
a
device
that
would
attach
to
akis
chest
plate
to
gather
the
eighth
spirit
and
and
what
and
then
we
wait
and
see
what
happens
thats
it
thats
your
plan
we
wait
and
see
what
happens
oh

good

well

i
got
my
own
plan
we
keep
scanning
the
surface
from
orbit
and
maybe
well
find
a
compatible
spirit
somewhere
else
i
say
we
go
in
what
caused
the
barrier
to
fail

general
hein
im
afraid
it
was
only
a
matter
of
time
before
the
phantoms
developed
an
immunity
to
our
barriers
but
i
am
relieved
to
see
that
you
and
the
council
were
able
to
evacuate
to
houston
without
incident
it
was
a
terrible
loss
suffered
this
evening
the
council
has
reconsidered
your
proposal
to
fire
the
zeus
cannon
i
see
we
are
transmitting
the
access
codes
to
you
now
and

general
best
of
luck
to
us
all
prepare
to

of
them

the
eighth
spirit
along
the
craters
surface
all
right

now
lets
take
a
closer
look
ready
to
fire
in
three
minutes
ovopacs
at
maximum

transferring
plasma
flow
to
auto
counterthrusters

lox

decoupled

status

we

something
on
radar

the
impact
site

sir

just
a
traitor
under
the
influence
of
the
enemy
continue
the

same
time

you
patch
us
through
what
is
that
thing
i
dont
know

sir
incoming
message

sir
general
hein

cease
fire
immediately
what
youre
seeing
is
the
living
spirit
of
an
aliens
home
world
their
planet
was
destroyed
and
landed
here
this
is
not
an
invasion

it
never
was
i
see

what
have
we
been
fighting
all
this
time
ghosts
yes

spirits
that
are
confused

lost
and
angry
right

and
these
spirits
are
coming
out
of
this
gaia
thing
you
have
to
listen
alien
gaia

earth
gaia

even
if
i
believed
that
the
earths
under
attack
from
an
aggressor
who
must
be
destroyed
at
all
costs
the
cost
may
be
the
entire
planet

sir
firing
on
the
alien
gaia
will
only
make
it
stronger
since
youre
under
the
aliens
influence

ill
take
it
that
were
taking
the
correct
action
so
take
your
last
few
moments
and
prepare
to
meet
your
gaia
continue
to
fire
until
the
invader
has
been
destroyed
general

the
systems
overheating
well
hit
again
and
keep
on
hitting
it
until
its
dead
but
were
not
even
sure
if
its
having
any
effect
no
effect
weve
got
them
on
the
run

soldier
this
is
our
moment
of
victory

i
order
you
to
fire
the
system
wont
allow
us
to
fire

well
see
about
that
our
shield
is
out

were
sitting
ducks

come
on
this

be
what
the
hell
is

i
think

is
yes

looking
at
gaia

do
you
hear
me

sid
gaia
this
explains
why
the
eighth
spirit
appeared
here
yes

thats
it
a
phantom
changed
into
the
eighth
spirit
at
touching
a
life
born
from
our
own
gaia
it
wouldve
gotten
a
different
energy
signature
that
set
it
apart
from
the
other
phantoms
you
couldnt
have
hoped
for
a
better
location
to
find
a
new
compatible
spirit
whatever
you
do

dont
move

stay
right
where
you
are
staying
where
we
are
isnt
as
easy
as
it
sounds
dont
shoot
any
of
them
you
could
very
well
destroy
our
last
hope
what
do

suggest
ask
them
to
play
nice
combat
strategy
is
your
area
of
expertise

one

difficult
to
narrow
down

me
no
motive
do
we
have
one
pressure
no

i
dont
buy
that
he
was
also
getting
divorce
about
a
month
ago

he
told
me
he
and
his
wife
might
be
splitting
i
didnt
think
it
was
serious
this
doesnt
make
any
sense

guys
they
never
do

captain
come
on
the
facts
speaks
for
themselves
no

they
dont
why
if
carls
is
involves

why
didnt
they
ask
him
to
the
bank
jenkins
mrs

callo

do
you
feel
ok
to
continue
wife
came
home
approximately

minutes
ago
there
were
no
force
entry
and
no
one
saw
anything
fled
from
the
scene
guys

blue
prints
of
the
bank
so
thats
it
detective
carls
you
are
putting
on
the
pieces
together
they
wouldnt
have
punish
him
but
i
will
vengeance
will
be
mine

detective
then
come
and
get
me

you
piece
of
shit
i
think
the
cop
will
be
smarter
so
callo
was
involved

and
now
they
are
dragging
you
into
it
the
man
said
he
wanted
vengeance
so
i
just
got
off
the
phone
with
agent
doyle
and
apparently
after
the
shuttle
breaks
and
the
prints
withdrew
all
these
possessions
from
every
safe
deposit
box
in
the
country
they
didnt
touch
the
cash
all
the
safe
deposit
boxes
and
they
break
into
a
bank
blow
it
up
and
steal
nothing
is
this
makes
sense
to
you
after
today

it
makes
sense
return
to
the
earth
now
if
your
mind
is
in
trouble

your
heart
is
in
search

he
goes
back
to
where
he
came
from
to
find
the
path
the
answer
when
you
hit
a
dead
end

go
back
to
the
beginning
to
find
your
way
or
something
like
that
we
have
a
genuine
philosopher
i
must
admit
are
you
a
buddhist
no

just
something
i
picked
up
along
the
way
but
you
are
religious
not
particularly
you
guys
all
are
very
tight
we
been
through
a
lot
together
even
when
things
get
pretty
wild
today
when
everybody
else
panic
he
was
in
control
what
are
you
doing
being
around
you

all
these
things

a
match
they
got
a
name
chris
lei
the
prick
used

a
big
time
software
company

they
caught
him
pirating
programs
couple
of
years
later
he
was
busted
hacking
into
a
pension
plans
until
the
time
comes
lets
say
for
a
genius

he
is
a
fucking
moron
this
is
your
case
was
it
true
the
guy
was
guilty
hes
a
scum
look

theres
something
they
dont
teach
you
the
system
breaks
down

you
have
to
compensate
to
get
the
result
that
gives
you
the
right
to
break
the
rules
bend

not
break
it
means
justice
absolutely
i
bet
you
will

chris
first
day
in
the
city
and
youre
already
been
shot

grace
him
what
if

just
grace

cop

a
better
man
detective

go
home
is
there
something
you
want
to
say
no
sir
carls
is
right

we
shouldnt
have
gone
in
fucking
dumb
of
me
detective

i
know
what
are
they
doing
inside
the
bank
these
are
the
record
transactions
of
the
bank
and
average
a
day
produces
about

to

pages
give
and
take
today

they
were
over

pages
we
just
witness
largest
bank
heist
in
the
history
about
a
billion
dollars
they
planted
a
computer
virus
they
randomly
withdraw
money
from
all
the
accounts
and
deposit
it
into
the
bad
guys
account
now

if
you
look
at
all
the
transactions
no

amounts
are
the
same
and
none
of
them
over

of
dollars
you
see

most
of
the
security
systems
work
the
size
of
the
money
where
is
the
money
now
what
do
you
mean
you
dont
know
so
the
money
still
moving
around
so
why
break
in
if
they
were
just
wiring
money
couldnt
they
do
it
anywhere
no

you
see
thats
the
original
managers
computer
terminal
from
there
you
have
a
limited
entry
into
the
bank
mainframe
so
theres
no
more
working
around
password
theres
no
hacking
in
just
straight
forward
nice
and
clean
a
billion
dollar
is
missing
and
we
discovering
it
now
ironically

when
you
guys
shut
down
the
power
it
bought
us
time
to
work
what
you
going
to
do
now
i
think
this
is
beyond
our
jurisdiction
its
not
over
yet
no

my
wish
is
to
catch
you
youre
a
murderer
a
cop
killer

billion
dollar

the

a
selling
frenzy
this

panic
may
have
been
caused
by
computer
malfunction
it
is
believed
to
be
related
its
not
as
bad
as
it
looks
we

my
fellow
americans
it

time
to
strike
fear
into
the
citizenry
ask
not
its
not
an
authorised
broadcast
what
your
country
can
do
to
avert
this
crisis
the
answer
is
nothing
what
so
ever
our
military
strength
is
in
this
case
useless
read
my
lips
the
great
confident
ruler
of
the
american
progress
and
growth
has
come
to
an
end
all
the
vital
technology
that
that
this
nation
possesses
all
communication
transportation

internet
connectivity
electrical
power
critical
utilities
their
in
our
hands
we
will
not
tire
we
will
not
falter
and
we
wont
fail
i
dont
know
how
they
are
getting
in

a
happy
independence
day

shes
not
actually
in
charge
of
anything
what

a
three
step
it

a
three
step
systematic
attack
on
the
entire
national
infrastructure
ok
step


take
out
all
the
transportation
step


the
financial
base
and
telecoms
step

of
all
the
utilities

gas

water

electricity

nuclear
basically
everything
that
is
controlled
by
a
computer
which
nowadays

everything

thats
why
they
call
it
a
fire
sale
because
everything
must
go
hey

your
name
farrell

your
voice

whole
joint

this
kid

obviously

its
got
something
to
do
with
whats

humler

taking
over
the
interrogations
of
the
hackers
that
we
are
bringing
in
i

escort

molina

get
this
kid
to
the
front
of
the
line
i
want
to
know
what
he
knows

right
if
he
knew
about
half
of
what
i
know

his
fuzzy
little
head
would
explode
special
agent
johnson

i
will
take
you
there
agent
johnson
thats
right
so
is
any
of
what
you
were
saying
possible
possible
ok
look

i
will
tell
you
again

if
you
take
away
any
one
thing

problem
but
if
you
take
it
down
all
at
once

the
system
crashes

and
look
around

man
come
on

the
government
has
got
to
have
dozens
of
departments
dedicated
to
that
shit
it
took
fema

days
to
get
water
to
the
superdome
how
long
until
we
get
to
the
dept

of
homeland
security
lauflin

get
on
the
police
band
and
get
them
to
clear
a
route
to
the
dhs
dc
metro

this
is
the
fbi


requesting
you
to
farrell
just
resurfaced
on
the
grid
the
feds
are
taking
him
to
homeland
good

close
that
loop
now
isolate
the
frequency
locate
the
vehicles
and
get
me
john
mcclanes
file
brad

we
just
found
farrell

stand
by
for
location
i
dont
mean
to
harp
guys
but
but
have
just
passed
another
snack
bar
and
i
am
starving
shut
up

i
need
to
eat
shut
up

you
have

minutes
to
tell
me
why
you
lied
to
me
back
there
did
i
lie
to
you
what
are
you
talking
about
the
pictures
on
the
wall

you
knew
those
guys

right
i

wha

i
kid

dont
lie
to
me
i
am
a
cop

can
tell
you
are
lying

who
are
they
ok

ok
ok
they
were
my
competition
make
the
next
right
onto
concord
they
said
they
were
a
software
firm
that
had
developed
some
kind
of
a
new
algorithm
and
they
just
wanted
to
see
if
it
could
be
cracked
thats
what
i
do

i
do
math
based
security
heres
the
thing
the
thing
that
ive
been
thinking
is
that
if
you
can
do
something
this
massive
you
need
tons
of
startup
guys
to
write
the
software
but
only
a
few
black
hats
to
actually
implement
that
stuff
so
then
the
startup
guys
who
havent
really
done
anything
like
me
end
up
as
pictures
on
a
wall
i
swear
to
god
mcclane
i
had
no
idea
i
was
gonna
be
an
accessory
to
armageddon

extremely
cautious

telling

to
abandon
vehicles

until

see
k
units
are
checking
each

with
me
sir
hang
on

john
another
day
in
paradise
they
just
swamped
everything
the
whole
telecom
system

phones

cellular

satellite
they
are
blanketing
every
station
can
you
put
the
news
back
on
this
is
the
news
it
on
every
channel

its
been
like
this
for
a
few
minutes
now
mcclane
look
out
bowman
do
you
see
that
mcclane
bowman
its
a
fake
i
see
it
thank
god
the
satellites
down

get
me
a
landline
one
little
piece
of
code
and
the
world
falls
apart
this
is
virtual
terrorism

what
its
crazy

the
first
time
that
i
heard
of
a
fire
sale
i
actually
thought
it
would
be
cool

if
somebody
did
it
hit
the
reset
button
melt
the
system

just
for
fun
hey

it
is
not
a
system
it
is
a
country

we
are
talking
about
people
a
whole
country

full
of
people
sitting
at
home

alone
scared
to
death
in
their
houses

alright
so
if
you
are
done
with
your
little
nostalgic
moment
maybe
you
can
think
a
little
and
help
me
catch
these
guys
just
help
me
just
put
yourself
in
their
shoes
come
on
if
this
were
your
fire
sale

what
would
be
your
next
move
ok

the
point
of
a
fire
sale
is
that
it
is
mostly
done
by
remote

right
but
not
everything
is
run
completely
online
major
utilities
arent

they
are
run
in
closed
circuits
you
can
breech
the
security
up
to
a
certain
point

but
to
shut
it
down
you
would
have
to
physically
go
there
you
know
what

give
me
that
guys
pda
the
phones
dont
work

they
are
all
dead
no
the
phones
are
fine
it
is
the
network
that
is
dead
i
only
need
to
reprogram
it
and
link
it
into
the
old
satcoms

hackers
surf
them
the
whole
time
it
is
probably
what
these
guys
are
using
to
talk
to
each
other
how
do
you
know
all
this
stuff
dude

i
dont
know
i
couldnt
explain
it
to
you

national
power
grid

the
electricity
they
are
divided
in
to
three
zones

right
eastern

central
and
western

each
one
with
a
primary
hub
here
it
is
what
is
that

i
looking
at
that
is
the
eastern
hub
now

they
take
this
out
it
wipes
out
all
the
power

entire
eastern
corridor

will
have
to
do
it
manually
come
on

spook
for

ok
first

on

he
goes
and
tells
his
bosses
that
the
nations
security
infrastructure
is
wide
open
to
compromise
and
what
did
they
say
we
will
take
it
under
advisement
but
he
doesnt
ease
up
cos
he
is
committed

like
you
read
about
so
he
breaks
into
a
meeting
of
the
joint
chiefs
of
staff

ok
using
just
a
laptop
he
hacks
into
norad
and
shuts
down
the
entire
defence
network
so
they
put
a
gun
to
his
head
and
forced
him
to
stop
the
hack
thomas
gabriel
is
the
guy
who
shut
down
norad

plan

like
a
way
to
do
that
ok

according
to
the
layout

the
chilling
towers
are
kept
on
the
bottom
level
it
should
be
locked
ok

now
it
looks
like
we
are
getting
somewhere
ok
this
looks
like
it
controls
the
cooling
system
for
the
mainframe

which
should
be
if
i
can
just
hack
in
and
trip
the
alarm

it
might
alert
bowman
somebody
set
off
the
alarms
yes

thank
you
detective

i
can
hear
that
find
a
way
to
turn
it
off
we
got
a
problem
the
alarms
went
off
at
woodlawn
its
got
to
be
him
and
whats

woodlawn
its
nsa
a
secure
facility
outside
of
baltimore
its
a
failsafe
we
built
after
to
backup
all
financial
information
the
moment
the
networks
were
hit
all
the
financial
data
it
automatically
began
downloading
to
those
servers
banks

wall
street

corporate
records
government
funds

all
of
it
basically
a
backup
for
the
accumulated
wealth
of
america
all
in
one
location
what
could
gabriel
do
with
it
if
he
could
get
in
he
might
try
a
transfer
of
the
data
to
a
portable
hard
drive
then
he
can
have
access
to
those
accounts
anywhere
syphon
of
billions
for
himself
we
would
have
no
way
to
trace
it
but
knowing
him

he
could
erase
it
all
and
send
us
back
to
the
stone
age
why
the
hell
wasnt
i
told
about
this
frankly
its
above
your
pay
grade

my
pay
grade
how
did
gabriel
find
out
about
this
when
i
didnt
even
know
he
designed
it
it
was
his
program
he
knew
that
hacking
your
system
last
night
would
trigger
the
download

son
it
is
time
to
enter
in
action
it
is
the
first
sorcerers
thought
he
thinks
with
your
return
talk
a
little
lower
it
gets
stronger
every
minute

we
have
to
act
now
harry
mrs

weasley
how
good
that
you

well
starving

but
i
fear
that
dinner

which
wait
until
the
meeting
finish
a
without
time
to
explanation
direct
upwards
first
door
to
the
left
which
kind
of
scum
that
they
they
let
enter
her
home
what
my
mistress
would
he
tell
to
the
monster
what
a
shame
do
not
worry

madame

the
monster
is
here
we
keep
knowing
that
it
was
attacked
by
dementadores
again
it
needs
to
to
tell
us
everything

lets
him
breathe

hermione
and
this
audience
in
the
ministry
it
is
outrageous
i
already
searched

they
ca
not
expel
you
it
is
much
injustice

it
is
it
has
been
existing
much
injustice

hermione
so

what
is
that
place
it
is
the
thirst
of
the
order
of
the
phoenix
it
is
a
secret
society
dumbledore
founded
her
when
they
fought
against
youknowswho
they
could
not
have
counted
everything
in
a
letter
i
passed
the
whole
summer
without
news
we
wanted
to
write

harry

we
wanted
same
but
but
the
what
dumbledore
did
us
swear
to
do
not
count
anything
did
dumbledore
tell
that
but
why
he
wanted
do
let
me
in
the
darkness
perhaps
i
could
help
after
all
was
i
who
it
saw
voldemort
return
was
i
who
fought
with
him
and
who
saw
cedrico
be
killed
we
think
i
was
you
talking

do
not
repress
your
rage
it
uncovers
if
already
it
tired
of
the
little
talk
what
it
thinks
of
something
more
interesting
and
if
anybody
ask
it
is
harry
if
you
were
not
by
harry

no
we
would
know
that
voldermort
came
back
he
is
a
child

molly

and
do
not
i
know
as
well
he
is
not
tiago
harry
it
is
not
your
son
they
are
dead
the
ones
that
he
has

he
still
has
to
me
how
touching
that
paternity
feeling
perhaps
potter
grows
for
be
an
equal
criminal
to
the
godfather
it
stays
outside
this

snotty
snape
also
belongs
to
the
order

shit
i
do
not
care
for
what
dumbledore
said
and
should
not
i
know
then
why
do
not
you
talk
bichento
bichento

it
is
quiet
hermione

i
hate
that
cat

bichento
ugly
we
are
going
to
eat
in
the
kitchen
just
because
you
they
can
use
magic
it
does
not
mean
that
ought
to
use
the
rod
for
everything
it
is
hungry

harry
it
is
very
same

harry
you
gave
us
a
fright
and
so
much
harry
potter
sirius
it
seems
that
your
audience
in
the
ministry
it
is
in
front
of
the
supreme
whole
cut
i
do
not
understand

what
the
does
magic
department
have
against
me
show
him
he
is
going
to
discover
soon
daily
prophet
the
boy
who
mind
he
is
attacking
dumbledore
as
well
fudge
is
using
his
powers
inclusive
the
influence
his
in
the
daily
prophet
to
dirty
the
name
from
whom
tells
which
the
lord
of
the
darkness
returned
the
minister
thinks
dumbledore
it
wants
his
job
what
a
madness
nobody
in
i
perform
judgement
would
believe
that
there
you
are
fudge
is
not
with
the
perfect
judgement
it
was
perverted
and
blunt
by
the
fear
the
fear
obliges
the
people
the
terrible
things

harry
of
last
time
that
voldemort
it
took
over
he
almost
destroyed
everything
which
appreciate
most
now
that
returned

i
fear
that
the
minister
go
to
do
everything
the
possible
for
avoid
the
terrible
truth
we
think
voldemort
wants
gather
your
army
again
years
ago
he
it
commanded
many
people
not
only
bewitching
and
sorcerers

but
several
creatures
of
the
darkness
he
walks
recruiting
many
and
we
are
trying
to
do
the
same
but
to
gather
followers
not
it
is
his
unique
interest
we
believe
which
voldemort
is
behind
a
thing
a
thing
that
he
not
it
got
in
the
last
time
it
means

a
gun
no
already
it
arrives
he
is
alone
a
boy
if
you
tell
more

it
is
the
even
though
i
induced
him
to
enter
order
great

i
want
to
come
in
if
voldemort
is
gathering
a
army
then
i
want
to
fight
you
are
expelled
of
the
magic
school
trains
in
the
underground
these
bundles
are
very
smart
we
arrive
i
never
used
the
entrance
of
visitors
before
should
be
fun
we
just
place
money
the
daily
prophet
ladies
and
gentlemen
anyone
it
can
buy
your
prophet
is
dumbledore
deaf
or
dangerous

talks
when
they
talk
to
you

did
not
do
anything
of
wrong
as
they
tell
the
bundles
the
truth
is
going
to
appear

minister
of
the
magic
witness
for
defense
target
percival
wulfrico
brian
dumbledore
it
received
the
communication
that
the
hour
and
did
the
location
of
the
audience
have
changed
should
have
lost
but
for
a
happy
mistake

arrived
to
the
ministry
three
hours
earlier
accusations
the
accusations
against
the
defendant
are
the
next
which
he
deliberately
it
executed
patrons
sorcery
in
the
presence
of
a
bundle
do
you
deny
the
execution
of
such
a
patron
no

but
you
know
that
it
is
prohibited
to
use
magic
outside
the
school
with
less
than

years
yes

i
esteemed
sorcerers
and
witches
of
the
supreme
cut
i
only
did
it
for
cause
of
dementadores
dementadores
in
little
whinging
that
is
very
creative
bundles
ca
not
see
dementadores

can
they
boy
very
convenient
i
do
not
be
lying

i
had
two
their
e
i
regret
to
interrupt
what
it
would
be
a
very
very
rehearsed
history
but
as
it
ca
not
bring
no
witness
for
the
event
excuse
me
minister
but
actually

can
please

describe
the
attack
how
were
they
one
was
very
great

and
the
other
very
thin
not
the
boys

dementadores
it
feels
well

well
great
with
coatings
after

everything
stayed
cold
as
if
to
all
happiness
it
vanished
of
the
world
sometimes

see

dementadores
not
they
roam
by
the
foolish
suburb
and
they
attack
a
sorcerer

the
chances
are
very
remote
i
do
not
think
someone
believe
that
dementadores
they
were
there
for
minister
coincidence
i
only
could
have
understood
wrong
teacher
dementadores
are
after
all
about
control
of
the
magic
department
it
can
sound
strange

but
it
sounded

for
a
moment
which
you
would
have
suggested
that
the
ministry
he
would
have
salary
the
attack
to
the
boy
yes

it
would
be
disturbing
same
madame
sub
secretary
because
of
this
i
am
sure
that
the
ministry
it
will
do
a
complete
investigation
to
know
because
two
dementadores
they
were
so
far
from
azkaban
and
because
they
attacked
without
authorization
of
course
there
is
someone
which
it
can
be
behind
the
attack
corn�lio
i
implore
that
hear
the
voice
of
the
reason
the
evidence
that
the
lord
of
the
darkness
returned
it
is
incontestable
he
is
not
back
in
the
that
tells
respect
harry
potter
the
law
tells
clearly
which
magic
will
be
able
to
be
used
ahead
of
bundles
in
life
risk
cases
laws
can
be
changed
if
necessary
dumbledore
clear

it
is
already
normal
practice
promote
a
criminal
trial
to
care
for
a
simple
in
case
of
teenager
magic
those
in
favor
of
the
condemnation
those
in
favor
of
acquit
the
defendant
of
all
the
accusations
innocent
of
the
accusations
teacher
cushions
did
you
go
nuts
it
is
going
to
deteriorate
all
the
operation
sirius

what
is
doing
here
if
someone
see
you
i
had
to
see
you
leave

did
not
have

a
war

sirius

to
be
as
before

with
her
finally
i
suppose
that
you
be
the
young
people
now
hi

harry
potter
i
am
surprised
that
the
minister
have
let
you
free

potter
better
to
seize
while

can
i
am
sure
that
already
it
has
one
cell

his
name
in
her
what
i
talked
you
completely
crazy

stay
far

pulling

as
lucid
as
i
this
is
dimoon
luna
lovegood
interesting
necklace
it
is
an
amulet
it
removes
narguil�s
i
am
hungry
i
hope
that
they
have
done
pudding
what
is
a
narguil�
i
do
not
have
idea
good
night
children
we
have
two
changes
in
the
teaching
staff
this
year
it
is
a
pleasure
have
back
to
the
teacher
grubblyplank
for
creatures
magic
treatment
while
the
teacher
hagrid
it
is
of
temporary
license
i
also
want
to
give
the
welcome
the
teacher
of
defense
against
the
arts
of
the
darkness

the
teacher
dolores
umbridge
i
am
sure
that
all
they
will
join
me
to
wish
to
the
teachers
good
luck
as
usual

our
concierge

mr

filch
it
asked
me
to
remind
you
she
was
in
the
audience
she
works
for
fudge
thank
you

director
for
these
nice
welcome
words
and
as
it
is
lovely
see
you
radiant
and
happy

smiling
at
me
i
am
sure
that
we
will
be
all
very
good
friends
very
unlikely

very
unlikely
the
magic
department
always
considered
the
education
of
young
sorcerers
and
witches
of
vital
importance
despite
each
director
have
brought
something
again
for
this
historical
school
the
progress

by
the
well
of
the
progress
it
needs
to
be
discouraged
we
will
preserve
what
should
be
preserved
improve
what
it
can
be
improved
and
prohibit
practices
that
should
be
prohibited
thanks
teacher
umbridge

it
was
same
very
enlightening
enlightening
how
much
daring
it
means
that
the
ministry
it
is
going
to
intervene
in
hogwarts
plotter
dino

simas
good
vacation
good
better
than
the
one
of
simas
my
mother
did
not
want
which
i
came
back
that
year
it
lets
me
see
because
of
you
the
daily
prophet
has
talked
a
lot
of
you
harry
and
about
dumbledore
as
well

and
your
mother
does
it
believe
well

nobody
was
there
in
the
night
that
cedrico
died
reading
the
prophet

you
and
your
sheass
mother
they
are
going
to
know
all
that
they
need
do
not
talk
about
my
mother
this
way
i
will
talk
about
anyone
that
call
me
liar
what
is
happening
it
is
happening
that
he
is
crazy
it
believes
in
lies
that
he
it
invented
about
youknowswho
yes

believe
more
someone
has
some
problem
with
harry
do
you
feel
well
great
what
a
pity
that
are
thinking
this
way

do
not
it
but
the
truth
is
going
to
appear
he
said
that
i
am
great

ron
it
feels
well
i
am
going
to
let
you
alone
it
goes

simas

hit
he
good
morning
children
levels
exams
ordinary
of
magic
n
the
m
s
known
most
as
noms
study
a
lot
and
they
will
be
rewarded
let
that
and
the
consequences
will
be
able
to
be
severe
their
previous
instructions
in
this
matter

were

too
much
improper
but
they
will
get
happy
in
know
which
from
now
on
are
going
to
follow
a
carefully
structured
course
and
approved
by
the
ministry
of
defensive
magic
there
is
not
anything
here
about
the
defense
sorceries
use
sorceries
use
i
do
not
manage
to
imagine
because
they
would
need
to
use
sorceries
in
my
class
do
we
go
magic
you
will
be
learning
about
defenses
sorceries
of
a
certain
form
and
without
risks
so
that
that
we
are
attacked
will
not
be
without
risks
students
should
lift
the
hand
to
talk
in
my
class
it
is
the
vision
of
the
ministry
which
a
study
theoretician
will
be
enough
for
faz�
them
pass
in
the
exams
what
an
after
all

it
belongs
to
the
which
if
treatment
school
and
as
it
is
just
that
the
theory
in
the
it
prepares
for
what
is
outside
there
is
not
anything
outside

dear
who
you
imagines
that
would
it
attack
children
like
you
i
do
not
know

perhaps
lord
voldemort
now

we
will
let
that
very
clear
they
talked
for
you
who
a
certain
sorcerer
of
the
darkness
it
is
at
large
again
that
is
a
lie
it
is
not
a
lie

i
saw

i
fought
with
him
mr

detention
potter
then
second
you

cedrico
diggory
fell
dead
why
he
wanted
the
death
of
cedrico
diggory
it
was
a
tragic
accident
he
was
murdered
voldemort
killed

that

it
came
back
to
the
normal
what
it
has
to
wrong
with
your
hand
to
other
hand
you
should
tell

the
dumbledore

no
dumbledore
already
has
much
thing
in

anyway

i
do
not
want
give
this
satisfaction
to
umbridge
devils
harry

the
woman

is
torturing
you
if
your
parents

about
this
only
that
i
do
not
have
parents

do
it
have
rony
harry

you
have
to
report
that
it
is
very
simple
no

is
not
hermione

be
what
it
is
is
not
thus
simple
you
does
not
understand
but
i
want
to
understand
dear
cushions
i
hope
that
i
feel
well
it
is
starting
to
stay
cold
here
definitively
the
winter
it
is
arriving
in
spite
of
being
back
to
the
hogwarts

i
feel
more
only
than
never
i
know
that
you

above
of
all

it
is
going
to
understand
hey

harry
potter
their
feet
are
they
cold
a
little
unfortunately
all
my
shoes
they
disappeared
mysteriously
suspect
who
narguil�s
be
for
tr�s
of
this
what
are
them
they
are
called
trest�lios
they
are
very
kind

but
people
avoid
them
because

they
are
a
little
different
but
because
the
others
does
not
it
manage
to
see
they
only
can
be
visas
for
people
who
already
turn
the
death
so

you
know
anybody
who
died
my
mother
she
was
a
witch
extraordinary

but
she
like
doing
experiences
a
day
a
sorcery
gave
wrong
i
was
im
sorry
it
is

it
was
doing
well
horrible
i
get
very
sad
because
of
this
sometimes
but
i
have
my
father
both
of
us
believe
in
you

by
the
way
which
thatwhodoes
not
ought
to
benominated
it
came
back
which
you
fought
with
him
and
that
the
minister
and
the
prophet
they
conspire
against
you
and
dumbledore
it
seems
that
you
are
the
only
that
believe
i
do
not
think
that
be
true
but
i
suppose
that
it
is
this
way
which
he
wants
you
if
you
feel
what
it
means
well

if
i
was
youknowswho
he
would
go
want
you
if
it
felt
isolated
of
all
because

if
you
are
you
alone
it
would
not
be
a
menace
very
large
do
you
never
stop
of
eating
the
what
i
am
hungry
can
i
join
you
me
sorry
teacher

but
what
is
insinuating
i
only
asked
that
in
the
that
tells
respect
to
my
students
you
follow
the
rules
prescribed
discipline
it
can
seem
foolery

but
it
sounded

as
if
it
was
questioning
my
authority
in
my
own
class
room
minerva
in
any
way

dolores
just
their
medieval
methods
me
sorry
dear
but
to
question
my
practices

it
is
to
question
the
ministry
and
for
extension
the
minister
in
person
i
am
a
tolerant
woman
but
we
have
a
thing
which
will
not
tolerate
it
is
disloyalty
disloyalty
the
things
in
hogwarts

are
very
worse
than
i
feared
corn�lio
will
have
to
immediately
act
educational
decree

dolores
joana
umbridge
was
nominated
for
the
position
of
high
inquisidora
de
hogwarts
educational
reform
already
having
revolutionized
the
didacticism
of
defense
against
the
arts
of
the
darkness
dolores
umbridge
goes
as
high
inquisidora
have
powers
minister
fudge
places
education
first
to
adjust
the
standards
unacceptable
of
the
school
of
hogwarts
just
a
dear
question
you
are
in
this
position

there
is
how
long
exactly
it
registered
before
for
the
position
in
the
defense
against
arts
of
the
darkness
but
it
did
not
obtain
success
prohibited
musics
products
weasley
they
will
be
banished
vestiments
appropriated
to
the
decency
you
could

please
foresee
anything
for
me
move
their
mouths
a
teeny
prophecy
what
a
pity
no

no
hang
on
i
think
i
saw
something

yes
i
see
something
dark
you
runs
great
danger
cho

what
is
happening
it
is
the
teacher
trelawney
sixteen
years
that
i
live
and
i
teach
here
hogwarts
is
my
house
you
ca
not
do
that
i
it
is
it
means
anything

dear
there
are
several
things
that
i
it
would
like
to
tell
dear
calm
teacher
mcgonagall
i
can
ask
to
carry
the
it
sibilates
back
into
for
here

dear
thank
you

for
here
dumbledore
i
owe
lembr�
him
which
by
the
terms
of
the
decree
educational
number
promulgated
by
the
minister
you
have
the
right
of
fire
teachers
but
it
does
not
have
authority
to
banished
them
of
this
location
that
can
pertence
to
the
director
for
now
should
not
be
studying
teacher
dumbledore
that
cursed
g�rgula
we
are
not
learning
to
defend
us
we
are
not
learning
to
pass
in
the
nons
she
is
possessing
herself
of
the
whole
school
safety
was
and
always
will
be
the
larger
priority
of
the
ministry
moreover

we
we
have
convincing
proofs
sirius
black
what
is
doing
here
answering
your
letter
he
said
that
it
was
worried
about
umbridge
what
is
she
doing
training
do
you
to
kill
halfbreed
sirius

she
does
not
let
us
use
no
magic
that
does
not
surprise
me
the
last
information
they
belong
that
fudge
does
not
want
you
trained
in
combat
combat
what
does
he
find
which
are
do
form
a
sorcerers
army
it
is
exactly
what
he
finds
which
dumbledore
is
gathering
all
the
forces
to
take
the
ministry
he
becomes
more
paranoiac
every
minute
the
others
they
do
not
want
i
count
that
for
you
harry
but
the
things
will
not
go
nothing
well
in
the
order
fudge
blocks
everything
the
whole
time
and
these
disappearances
they
are
exactly
of
the
appearance
which
started
before
voldemort
is
acting
what
we
can
do
someone
is
coming
sorry
to
not
help
but
for
now

at
least
it
seems
that
you
they
are
independently
he
is
same
outside

is
not
he
we
need
to
be
able
of
defend
us
and
if
umbridge
refuses
to
teach
us
we
need
someone
who
teaches
that
is
madness
who
would
go
to
want
be
taught
for
me

i
crazy
am
reminds
see
by
the
good
side
you
ca
not
be
worse
that
the
guy
thanks

ron
whenever
need
who
is
going
to
find
us
there
only
some
people
lovely
place
i
thought
it
would
be
safer
and
it
would
mislead
people
come
back
here
you
know
because
we
are
here
we
need
a
teacher
an
adequate
teacher
one
that
has
experience
in
if
defend
against
the
arts
of
the
darkness
why
why
because
youknowswho
it
came
back

idiot
it
is
what
he
tells

it
is
what
dumbledore
tells
dumbledore
tells
because
he
tells
the
matter
is

where
is
the
proof
potter
could
tell
more
about
as
diggory
was
killed
i
do
not
am
going
to
talk
about
cedrico
it
is
because
of
this
that
are
here

they
can
go
away
lets
go

hermione
they
only
came
here
because
they
think
i
am
an
aberration
it
is
true
that
can
do
execute
patrons
sorcery
i
already
saw
oh
harry

did
not
know
which
managed
to
do
that
and
he
killed
a
basilisk
with
a
sword
in
the
room
of
the
dumbledore
in
the
rd
year
he
fought
against
hundreds
of
dementadores
of
once
only
and
last
year
he
fought
with
youknowswho
in
person
look
it
seems
great
when
talked
this
way

but
the
truth
is
that
i
had
much
luck
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
many
times

and
always
had
help
he
is
being
modest

not
hermione

do
not
be
face
these
things
in
the
real
life

it
is
not
as
school
at
school
if
you
be
mistaken

it
can
try
again
tomorrow
but
outside
when
you
are
to
a
according
to
of
being
dead
or
to
see
a
friend
die

ahead
their
eyes
you
do
not
know
how
is
you
all
right
harry

we
do
not
know
because
of
this
we
need
of
your
help
because
we
want
have
the
chance
of
defeating
voldemort
is
he
same
back
first
need
a
place
for
train
without
umbridge
discover
the
house
of
the
screams
very
small
the
prohibited
forest
it
is
not
going
to
come
out
right
harry

what
happens
if
do
umbridge
discover
who
we
import
i
tell
until
is
touching

is
not
it
break
the
rules
who
are
you
and
what
did
with
hermione
granger
finally

at
least
know
a
thing
certainly
of
this
meeting
which
cho
did
not
manage
to
take
your
eyes

are
not
near
days
will
draw
up
a
list
of
places
that
can
practice
we
have
to
be
sure
of
be
there
where
is

nobody
discovers
all
student
organizations
are
from
now
on
dissolved
the
student
who
disobey
it
will
be
expelled
it
where
is
going
longbottom
you
got
neville
you
found
the
room
needs
which
room
it
also
is
wellknown
like
the
room
comesandgoes
the
room
needs
only
appears
when
someone
it
needs
very
of
her
and
always
is
equiped
with
that
it
is
needed
and
if
i
needed
a
lot
of
a
bathroom
charmer

ronald
but
yes
it
is
this
the
idea
it
is
brilliant
it
is
as
if
hogwarts
it
wanted
fought
expelliarm
i
am
an
useless

you
are
flowering
the
too
much
rod
try
this
way
expelliarmus
want
please

copy
the
approved
text
four
times
to
guarantee
maximum
learning
it
does
not
need
to
talk

much
less
think
expelliarmus
keep
the
rods
estonteamento
is
one
of
the
sorceries
more
useful
in
your
arsenal
it
is
an
essential
artifice
for
the
sorcerer

so
lets
go

nigel
give
your
better
shot
estupefa�a
nothing
badly
same

go
ron
lets
go
ron

was
already

ron
a
second

bet
thanks

shut
up
i
let
her
do
that
she
would
get
bothered
it
was
completely
intentional
all
the
students
they
will
be
interrogated
about
activities
illicit
suspicions
it
wants
a
tea
cup
now
it
concentrates
in
a
fixed
point
and
it
try
again
very
good

keep
the
concentration
right
a
little
higher
i
feel
well
i
feel
well
the
ones
that
they
want
to
join
to
the
brigade
inquisitorial
for
extra
credit
it
owes
if
register
in
the
high
magic
room
reducio
work
last
it
is
important
but
it
has
a
thing
that
even
imports
believe
in
himself
think
thus
all
great
sorcerer
in
the
history
started
as
nothing
more
of
the
which
are
now
students
if
they
manage
to
do
that
why
not
we
you
get
reducto
fantastic
neville

very
good
this
was
the
todays
lesson
now
we
only
are
going
to
gather
us
after
the
holidays
so

continue
practicing
alone
the
possible
maximum
and
congratulations
to
everybody

great
work
very
good

harry

thanks
we
see
us
in
the
communal
room

harry
thank
you
very
much

harry

not
at
all
merry
christmas
thank
you
very
much
it
was
not
anything
thanks

merry
christmas
thank
you

merry
christmas
merry
christmas
have
a
great
christmas

harry

you
as
well

luna
we
walk
thinking

harry
we
could
place
some
vomitilhas
in
the
umbridges
tea
or
febricolate

you
stay
with
some
full
furuncles
it
seems
great
boys

do
give
me
license
i
knew
that
umbridge
caught
weighed
with
you
that
day
at
least

was
worthwhile
it
is
just
that
learning
all
this
it
does
me
think

which
if
he
knew
cedrico
knew
all
of
these
sorceries
only
that
voldemort
was
better
you
are
a
great
teacher
harry
i
never
had
gotten
confuse
anything
before
a
visgo
it
probably
is
full
of
narguil�s
what
s�o
narguil�s
i
do
not
have
idea
well
and
how
was
i
tell

she
was
in
half
that
crying
you
kisses
badly
same

hein
i
am
sure
that
the
kiss
of
the
harry
was
more
than
satisfactory
she
has
been
crying
almost
the
whole
time
these
days
some
kisses
would
owe
anim�
her
it
does
not
understand
like
her
should
be
feeling
it
stands
to
reason
that
she
is
in
sad
by
the
cedrico
confused
to
like
harry

it
feels
blamed
by
t�
him
kissed
in
conflict
with
umbridge
who
wants
fire
her
mother
of
the
ministry
and
afraid
of
do
not
pass
in
the
noms
for
being
so
worried
about
everything
a
person
ca
not
feel
all
this
she
would
explode
that
is
because
your
emotional
side
it
belongs
to
the
size
of
a
teaspoon
voldemort
oughts
to
be
behind
something
something
that
he
not
it
got
of
the
last
time
in
the
dream

you
was
it
close
to
the
victim
or
i
sell
the
scene
of
the
high

the
two

i
was
not

dumbledores
room

a
moment
that
i
i
wanted
this
connection

come
in
voldemort
and
i
and
if
the
reason
of
her

it
is
that
am
i
being
alike
to
him
i
feel
so
much
hatred
the
whole
time
and
if

turning
me
badly

me
with
a
lot
of
attention
harry
you
are
not
a
bad
person
you
are
a
person
very
good
to
who
bad
things
happened
moreover

the
world
it
does
not
divide
into
people
good
and
guests
of
the
death
we
all
have
light
and
darkness
within
us
what
it
imports
is
the
side
by
the
which
decide
to
act
that
is
what
we
really
are
harry

hour
to
going
when
all
this
finish
we
will
be
a
normal
family
you
are
going
to
see
it
did
same
hagrid
came
back
i
am
going
to
talk
that
by
last
time
i
order
that
me
tell
where
it
was
already
he
said

i
was
to
care
for
of
the
health
of
the
health
yes
breathe
a
pure
air

you
know
clear

for
a
guardearths

pure
air
should
be
difficult
to
find
if
i
was
you

no
it
get
used
to
being
back
actually
neither
it
would
inconvenience
me
in
undo
the
suitcases
that
is
highly
secret

right
dumbledore
sent
me
to
negotiate
with
the
giants
giant
did
you
find
them
they
are
not
so
difficult
of
find
to
be
honest
they
are
so
great

are
not
they
i
tried
convenc�
them
the
they
join
the
cause
but
i
was
not
the
unique
the
try
to
do
of
them
allied
guests
of
the
death

yes
they
tried
persuaded
them
the
they
join
and
did
they
get
i
gave
dumbledores
message
i
suppose
that
any
if
remind
of
his
friendship
and
did
they
do
that
to
you
not
exactly
it
feels
well

coma
soon
then
your
petted
dog
outside
it
is
changing
equal
of
to
last
time
it
has
a
tempest
arriving

harry
it
is
better
are
all
ready
when
she
arrive
we
confirm
that

prisoners
extremely
dangerous
at
the
beginning
of
night
yesterdays
escaped
of
course
the
prime
minister
bundle
was
warned
of
the
danger
we
have
a
great
suspicion
if
that
the
escape
was
schematized
by
a
man
with
great
experience
in
run
away
from
azkaban
the
notorious
murderer
in
mass
he
is
cousin
of
the
fugitive

belatrix
lestrange
dumbledore
warned
to
fudge
which
that
was
going
to
happen
he
is
going
to
finish
killing
for
not
facing
the
truth
i
wanted
to
apologize
now
until
my
mother
tells
that
the
prophet
is
not
so
right
what
i
mean
is
that
i
believe
in
you
neville
years
ago
a
guest
of
the
death
called
belatrix
lestrange
it
used
the
curse
cruciatus
in
my
parents
she
tortured
them

to
take
information
of
them

but
they
did
not
talk
anything
i
have
much
pride
of
being
son
of
them
but
i
think
do
not
yet
be
ready
so
that
all
of
them
know
about
this
we
will
do
them
if
they
make
proud

neville
that
is
a
promise
think
in
a
very
strong
memory
in
excess
happy
than
have

allow
she
performs
you
continue
tried

simas
right

it
is
your
time
now
the
corporal
patron
is
the
more
difficult
of
produce
but
force
shields
also
are
useful
against
a
variety
of
opponents
fantastic
gina
mind
you

the
patron
only
protects
while
they
are
concentrated
then
they
concentrate
luna
think
of
happier

i
am
trying

i

it
is
a
very
advanced

people

they
are
leaving
itself
very
well
i
am
going
to
find
a
way
in
this
maxim
bombard

catch
them
i
am
observing
them
there
are
weeks

look

the
armada
dumbledore
proof
than
i
come
telling
right
from
the
start

corn�lio
all
your
dread
about
the
youknowswho
never
deceived
us
we
saw
what
her
lies
are
a
smoke
screen
for
your
attempt
to
take
over
the
ministry
naturally

no

teacher
he
did
not
have
anything
to
see
with
that

was
i
very
noble
of
your
part
harry

try
protect
me
but
how
was
pointed

the
name
tells
clearly
armada
dumbledore

not
of
the
potter
i
instructed
harry
the
form
this
organization
and
i

just
i

am
responsible
for
the
activities
send
an
owl
to
the
daily
prophet
if
she
is
fast
will
be
published
in
the
morning
edition
dawlish

shacklebolt
you
are
going
to
escort
dumbledore
for
azkaban
to
wait
the
trial
for
conspiracy
and
influenciamento
i
imagined
that
there
would
be
this
small
upset
you
seem
to
leave
of
the
principle
of
the
idea
that
i
will
go
without
complaining
good

go
talk
the
following
i
do
not
have
the
intention
of
go
to
azkaban
already
it
arrives
carry
him
do
not
like
his
minister
but
it
ca
not
deny
dumbledore
has
style
dolores
umbridge
substittui
target
dumbledore
like
director
of
the
school
of
hogwarts
boys
and
girls
ca
not
stay
the
less
than

centimeters
each
other
the
ones
that
they
want
to
join
to
me
in
the
brigade
inquisitorial
it
should
repress
the
several
illicit
activities
you
did
all
that
it
could
nobody
it
could
go
against
the
shrew
neither
dumbledore
imagined
which
that
would
happen
harry

if
someone
has
blame

are
we
it
is

we
convince
you
it
is

but
i
agreed
i
tried
so
much
help
and
only
i
managed
to
worsen
the
things
now
it
no
longer
matters
anymore
because
i
ca
not
play
more
with
who
imports
too
much
the
more
you
mind
more
you
have
to
lose
perhaps
be
better

the
what
i
go
alone
hagrid
what
is
he
doing
it
where
is
carrying
us
hagrid

why
not
it
tells
us
soon
i
never
saw
the
so
nervous
centaurs
and
they
are
already
dangerous
when
they
are
calm
if
the
ministry
restrict
more
the
territory
of
them
they
are
going
to
finish
with
a
revolt
in
hands
hagrid

what
is
happening
sorry
be
so
mysterious
with
you
three
i
neither
it
would
inconvenience
you
with
that

but
now
that
dumbledore
went
should
be
fired
at
any
time
i
could
not
go
away
without
count
for
someone
about
him
grope
here
in
low

your
great
bob�o
i
brought
company
for
you
i
could
not
deix�
him
because
because
he
is
my
brother
wow
well

half
to
tell
the
truth
he
is
completely
inoffensive

it
only
is
a
little
overhasty
i
passed
deodorant
in
him
grope

that
is
not
polite
hagrid

do
something
already
we
talk
about
that
it
ca
not
catch
anybody
this
is
your
new
friend

hermione
place
me
in
the
ground

a
pulse

it
won
an
admirer
stay
far
from
her

does
not
it
he
gets
his
property
food
and
everything
more
it
belongs
to
company
that
he
goes
need
when
i
go
away
they
are
going
to
care
for
of

right
i
am
the
unique
family
who
he
has
do
being
sentimental
that
is
particular

not
for
me
and
neither
for
the
lord
of
the
darkness
if
you
do
not
improve
all
memory
that
he
has
access
is
a
gun
that
he
can
use
against
you
it
would
not
last
neither
two
seconds
if
he
invaded
his
mind

your
father
dull

arrogant
do
not
talk
anything
against
my

my
i

that
i
was
a
times
matter
until
voldemort
do
the
connection
between
you
i
thought
me
moveing
away
of
you
how
i
did
during
whole
year

he
would
stay
less
tried
and
thus
you
would
be
in
more
protected
the
prophecy
told
one
ca
not
live
while
the
other
survive
it
means
that
one
of
we
it
goes
have
to
kill
the
another
in
the
final
why
he
did
not
tell
me
by
the
same
reason
that
you
tried
to
save
sirius
the
same
reason
that
their
friends
saved
you
after
all
of
these
years

after
all
that
you
suffered
i
did
not
want
to
cause
you
more
pain
i
worry
too
much
with
you
why

not
it
in
the

the
things
that
we
lose

they
finish
coming
back
for
us
in
the
final
not
always
of
the
form
which
wait
i
think

was
thinking
about
something
which
dumbledore

a
thing
that
voldemort

that

unto
you
for
your
lack
of
faith
woe
unto
you
who
do
not
believe
in
me

the
risen
christ
who
was
sent
to
you
by
him
who
made
the
heavens
and
the
earth
verily
i
say
unto
you

the
day
of
judgment
is
at
hand
god
has
summoned
me
to
prophesy
before
his
face
woe
unto
him
that
does
not
believe
for
only
those
who
have
faith
shall
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
johannes
yes
what
good
does
all
this
do

johannes
i
am
the
light
of
the
world
but
the
darkness
does
not
comprehend
it
i
have
come
unto
mine
own
but
mine
own
do
not
receive
me
what
are
the
candles
for
that
my
light
may
shine
in
the
darkness
i
feel
sorry
for
him
hes
completely
crazy
oh

mikkel
he
goes
around
thinking
hes
jesus
will
he
ever
be
sane
again
its
all
that
studying
that
has
turned
his
head
yes
he
should
never
have
been
made
to
study
i
did
it
because
he
had
a
talent
for
it
you
wanted
to
have
a
parson
in
the
family
no

mikkel

thats
not
true

there
are
parsons
enough
what
we
need
is
someone
who
can
shake
people
up
with
johanness
special
abilities
i
thought
he
might
be
the
spark
that
could
fire
christendom
again
from
this
farm
i
prayed
so
earnestly
that
it
be
he

the
prophet
that
should
come
the
reformer
the
renewer

yes

i
prayed
so
ardently
for
it
but
you
see
what
has
come
of
it
well

i
suppose
wed
better
go
back
to
bed

goodnight

father
goodnight

my
boy
goodnight

father
goodnight

anders
ill
just
go
and
have
a
look
at
the
sow
johannes
will
be
himself
again
ive
hoped
and
hoped
he
might

but
hell
never
get
any
better
why
dont
you
believe
so
miracles
dont
happen
any
more
nothing
is
impossible

if
one
prays
to
him
for
it
i
have
prayed
and
prayed
and
prayed

inger
then
you
must
go
on
praying
for
jesus
has
promised
what
we
pray
to
him
for

he
will
give
us
i
know

inger

i
know

but
what
good
have
all
my
prayers
done
how
do
you
know
what
your
prayers
may
have
set
in
motion
pray

and
go
on
praying

however
little
you
feel
it
helps
goodnight

little
granddad
goodnight

inger

i
think
ill
sit
here
a
little
while
longer
yes

all
right
goodnight
i
feel
so
sorry
for
your
father
im
sorry
for
johannes
so
am
i

but
but
what
johannes
is
perhaps
closer
to
god
than
the
rest
of
us
but
your
father
i
cant
stand
all
his
righteousness
i
think
you
are
being
unfair
he
has
also
been
unfair
to
me
he
has
never
reproached
you
no

he
kept
quiet

but
i
could
feel
what
he
was
thinking
i
saw
the
look
in
his
eyes
when
i
kept
away
from
all
the
godliness
here
on
the
farm
but
mikkel

you
believe
in
god

dont
you
you
know
how
i
feel
about
all
that

inger
that
you
have
no
faith
not
even
faith
in
faith
but
you
have
something
else

something
more
important
and
what
is
that
a
heart

goodness
i
tell
you

its
not
enough
to
have
faith
if
one
is
not
a
good
person
at
the
same
time
and
thats
what
you
are
but
i
have
no
faith
it
will
come
are
you
sure
of
that
yes

and
then
you
will
see
how
warm
you
will
feel
a
glow
inside
you
and
youll
be
so
happy
its
nice
to
be
happy

isnt
it
yes

inger

now
we
must
sleep

what
ive
asked
for
granddad

say
yes
now
after
hes
gone
over
there
without
saying
anything
to
me
about
it
and
you

inger

you
knew
about
it
and
never
said
a
word
its
a
conspiracy

a
conspiracy
of
my
own
children
behind
my
back
no

im
blessed
if
i
will
granddad

where
are
you
going
dont
ask
me

you
dont
tell
me
where
you
are
going
granddad

granddad
and
in
his
shirt
sleeves
youd
better
go
in
and
get
some
coffee
yes
and
tell
hans
to
give
the
mare
some
straw
here
you
are

what
came
over
you

granddad
borgens
farm
is
not
what
it
was
of
course
it
is
johannes
will
never
be
any
different
how
do
you
know
that
and
mikkel
will
never
be
any
different
that
you
can
name
those
two
in
the
same
breath
whats
wrong
with
mikkel

anyhow
just
this

that
he
has
renounced
the
faith
of
his
forefathers
mikkel
is
good
enough

he
has
god
in
his
heart
and
now
anders
sometimes
i
just
cant
understand
you
you
go
about
looking
as
though
god
has
forsaken
you
do
i
yes

something
has
snapped
inside
me
and
you
know
what
the
reason
is
because
god
did
not
hear
your
prayers
when
you
knelt
by
johanness
bed
no

inger

thats
where
you
are
wrong
it
was
not
gods
fault

it
was
my
own
if
i
had
had
faith
when
i
prayed

the
miracle
would
have
happened
but
i
prayed
only
because
i
thought
it
was
worth
trying
when
a
father
cannot
pray
for
his
child
with
faith
then
miracles
do
not
happen
dont
you
think
god
could
do
it
just
the
same
i
dont
believe
it
any
longer
do
you
know
what
i
believe
i
believe
a
lot
of
little
miracles
happen
secretly
god
hears
peoples
prayers

but
he
does
it
kind
of
secretly
so
as
not
to
have
too
much
fuss
made
about
it
perhaps
youre
right
i
think
ill
go
and
meet
maren
and
little
inger
they
must
be
on
the
way
home
from
school
yes

it
must
be
about
time
coming
along
you
bet
i
am
but
the
rheumatism
i
dont
give
a
darn
about
the
rheumatism
im
not
quite
a
cripple
yet
peter
petersen
tailor
the
time
is
coming
for
me
to
go

i
hear
the
voice
of
winter
for
i
also
am
only
a
bird
of
passage
my
real
home
is
elsewhere

you
are

little
anne

there
anybody
at
home

you
get
the
money

it

right

the
hens

sand
dunes

a
good
girl

some
firewood
in
with
you
all
right

mother
do
you
know
what
i
was
just
thinking

kirstine
no

peter
it
might
not
be
such
a
bad
thing
to
be
fatherinlaw
to
borgens
farm
then
anne
would
never
lack
anything
it
wasnt
the
worldly
advantages
i
was
thinking
of
wasnt
it
no

i
was
looking
further
ahead
what
were
you
thinking
of
i
was
wondering
if
we
small
folk
down
here
could
not
win
over
borgens
farm
for
the
kingdom
of
god
that
would
be
a
wonderful
thing
makes
you
feel
dizzy
it
did
me

too
but
i
came
down
to
earth
again
how

peter
i
realized
i
was
thinking
more
about
the
worldly
than
the
heavenly
advantages
it
was
a
blessing
our
lord
opened
your
eyes
yes

thanks
and
praise
be
to
him
pick
up
the
scraps

so
that
nothing
goes
to
waste
come
in
good
day

i
happened
to
be
passing
by
god
be
with
you
i
beg
your
pardon

are
perhaps
you
dont
know
me
are
you
the
son
of
the
farm
i
am
a
bricklayer
i
build
houses
but
nobody
will
live
in
them

like
to
build
themselves
they
build
themselves

even
though
they
do
not
know
how
therefore
some
of
them
inhabit
halffinished
huts
others
live
in
ruins
most
of
them
wander
about
homeless
are
you
one
of
those
in
need
of
a
house
i
am
the
new
minister

my
name
is
my
name
is
jesus
of
nazareth
jesus

but
how
can
you
prove
that
thou
man
of
faith

whose
own
self
lacks
faith
people
believe
in
the
dead
christ

but
not
in
the
living
they
believe
in
my
miracles
from

years
ago
but
they
dont
believe
in
me
now
i
have
come
again
to
bear
witness
to
my
father
who
is
in
heaven
and
to
work
miracles
miracles
no
longer
happen
thus
speaks
my
church
on
earth
that
church
which
has
failed
me
that
has
murdered
me
in
my
own
name
here
i
stand

and
again
you
cast
me
out
but
woe
unto
you

if
you
nail
me
to
the
cross
again
thats
absolutely
appalling
its
you

whats
wrong
with
you

think
im
just
as
much
a
believer
as
you

kirstine
thats
possible
but
you
are
not
of
our
faith
and
that
is
what
counts

little
yes

up

with
you
no

something
happened
was
it
a
love
affair
no

no

it
was
soren
kierkegaard
in
what
way
johannes
studied
theology

did
he
it
went
all
right
at
first
but
then
he
had
a
difficult
time
with
speculation
and
doubts
and
then
it
turned
inward
yes
it
must
have
been
a
terrible
time
for
the
family
yes

one
is
so
helpless

one
wants
to
help
but
there
is
nothing
one
can
do
here

a
wife

he
will
have
a
wife
of
the
same
faith
as
we

father
is
afraid
afraid
afraid
that
annes
faith

that
peter

triumph
over

inger

i
believe
you
understand
me
when
i
took
over
the
farm
here
there
wasnt
a
grain
of
living
christianity
in
the
whole
parish
i
began
one
man
against
them
all
in
church
they
thundered
against
me

no
one
was
on
my
side
here
from
this
farm
the
fight
was
waged
all
those
years
until
the
farm
had
won
the
victory
and
now
you
ask
me
to
open
the
doors
of
the
farm
to
the
sour
holy
crowd
down
by
the
village
pond
who
fought
against
me
no

id
sooner
die
first

can
you
understand
me

inger
yes

granddad

but
i
am
thinking
of
anders
i
know
anders

hes
a
good
boy
but
hes
weak
and
easily
influenced
and
therefore
he
should
have
a
wife
of
his
own
faith
and
hes
to
give
up
the
girl
he
loves
mind
what
you
say

way
there

father

you

then
you
can
drink
your
coffee
out
in
the
kitchen
all
right

that
is

if
the
if
you
think
it
best
you
can
do
it
anyhow
the
three
of
us
will
drink
in
the
kitchen
since
youll
decide
things
here
look
here

peter

on
the
way
over
ive
tried
to
see
things
from
your
point
of
view
and
what
did
you
come
up
with
that
theres
no
reason
for
our
children
to
suffer
because
we
two
dont
see
eye
to
eye
about
religion
anne
shall
have
one
of
our
own
faith
we
have
no
intention
of
taking
god
from
her
its
a
waste
of
time
talking
about
it
you
cant
understand
me
what
about
you
can
you
understand
me
i
can
understand
you
all
right

ive

that
was
not
enough
for
you
you
are
right

borgen

was
not
enough
for
me
i
wont
say
anything
against

i
cant
stand

im
darned
if

you
against

i
cant
stand
your
undertaker
faces

heard
that
before
no

you

you
have
the
bright

happy
christianity
while
we

we
are
the
dark
of
soul
and
undertakers
but
since
you
are
one
of
the
bright
and
happy
christians
why
do
you
always
look
so
miserable
when
one
meets
you
i
feel
so
free
and
glad
because
i
know
there
is
a
place
waiting
for
me
in
heaven
and
the
rest
of
us

all
the
rest
of
us

eternal
torments

morten

the
lord
is
the
god
of
miracles
he
has
the
power
to
redeem
you
from
disbelief
and
delusions
disbelief
and
disbelief
and
delusions
you
say
that
of
my
faith
do
you
know
what
the
difference
is
between
your
faith
and
mine
you
think
christianity
is
sullenness
and
selftorment
i
think
christianity
is
the
fullness
of
life
my
faith
is
for
all
day
long
and
joy
in
life
yours
is
the
longing
for
death
my
faith
is
the
warmth
of
life

yours
is
the
coldness
of
death
one
day
you
will
realize

peter

that
ours
is
the
right
way
what
is
it
really
you
are
looking
for
we
are
looking
for
god
and
nothing
else
well

it
all
sounds
very
nice

but
nevertheless
we
do
not
regard
you
as
being
either
converted
or
believers
so
in
my
opinion
in
your
opinion
you
are
all
lost
in
the
opinion
of
peter
the
tailor
well
all
end
in
hell
anders

little
brother
did
she
say
that

you
can
go
in

you
say
uncle
johannes

and
then
hell

just
like
the

in
the
bible

you

if
inger

old

hand

come
uncle

will

wont
you
itll
probably
come
to
nothing
the
others
wont
allow
me
to
then
what
about
mother
then
mother
will
go
to
heaven
but
i
dont
like
that
at
all
little
girl
you
dont
know
what
its
like
to
have
a
mother
in
heaven
is
it
better
than
having
her
here
on
earth
you
can
see
that
for
yourself
but
what
nonsense
if
we
get
into
trouble

we
wont
have
a
mother
to
look
after
us
a
child
that
has
a
mother
in
heaven
doesnt
get
into
trouble
when
ones
mother
is
dead

she
is
always
with
you
as
she
is
when
she
is
alive
but
then
she
has
so
many
other
things
to
think
about
yes

she
has
to
milk
and
scrub
the
floors
and
wash
up
the
dead
dont
have
to
do
all
that
id
rather
have
you
awaken
her

uncle
would
you
yes

so
that
we
could
keep
her
child
wont
you
awaken
her
if
the
others
will
allow
me

i
will
dont
you
bother
about
the
others
how
happy
i
am
are
you
yes

will
you
come
tuck
me
in
yes

and
i
will
let
one
of
my
fathers
angels
keep
watch
beside
your
bed
tonight
will
you
give
us
your
blessings

as
you
usually
do
yes

i
will
and
he
took
the
little
children
to
his
bosom
laid
his
hands
upon
them
and
blessed
them
god

not
send
death

i

both
the

his
car

what

me
look
in
i
wanted
to
hear
what
was
happening
good
evening

doctor
it
was
kind
of
you

you
see

my
sons
wife

and
then
we
thanks

but
ive
got
to
be
getting
home
you
can
drive
with
with
with
the
doctor
yes

of
course
yes

sit
down
now

ill
just
take
a
peep
in
there
shes
sleeping
like
one
of
gods
angels

here
you
are

doctor
its
like
a
miracle
you
must
pardon
me

my
good
borgen
i
dont
want
to
hurt
your
religious
feelings
but
now
that
its
turned
out
all
right

allow
me
to
tease
you
a
little
which
do
you
think
helped
most
this
evening
your
prayers
or
my
treatment
gods
blessing

my
dear
doctor
ora
et
labora

as
the
old
monks
used
to
say
perhaps
you
believe
in
miracles

reverend
believe
naturally
miracles
are
possible

since
god
is
the
creator
of
everything
and
everything
is
therefore
possible
to
him
but
but
on
the
other
hand

even
though
god
can
perform
miracles
he
does
not
do
so

and
why
not
because
miracles
would
break
the
laws
of
nature
and
naturally
god
does
not
break
his
own
laws
but
what
about
the
miracle
of
christ
those
were
under
special
circumstances
i
see

that
is
to
say
under
special
circumstances
your
otherwise
so
reliable
god
can
throw
a
hitch
into
the
works
come
on

my
good
pastor
thats
the
trouble
with
doctors
they
always
believe
in
whats
least
worth
believing
there
you
go

doctor
the
lord
be
with
you

the
lord
bless
you
and
keep
you
the
lord
let
the
light
of
his
countenance
shine
upon
you
and
give
you
grace
and
give
you
peace

amen
what
was
that
that
was
johannes
giving
his
blessing
to
the
little
children
yes

you
know

reverend
well

you
saw
him

didnt
you
excuse
me

but
dont
you
think
i
mean

wouldnt
he
be
better
off
in
a
home
my
boy
stays
here
with
me
so
long
as
i
am
at
borgens
farm
johannes
will
get
better
all
right
do
you
think
so
just
wait
until
he
runs
against
a
psychic
shock

which
will
turn
upside
down
that
bag
of
tricks
we
call
the
subconscious
you
think
he
can
be
as
he
was
before
yes

just
as
he
was
before
there
you
are

reverend

you
see
the
doctor
also
believes
in
miracles
i
believe
in
those
miracles
which
my
science
has
taught
me
god
grant
it
may
happen
yes

we
hope
so

borgen
ill
have
a
look
at
the
patient
and
then
well
be
off
im
ready
dear
borgen

my
heartiest
congratulations

much

reverend
arent
you
grateful
for
what
god
has
done

i

reverend
it
has
been
a
difficult
time
it

and
yet
i
would
not
have
missed
it
i
can
also
understand
that

doctor

illness

logan
mr

secretary

yes
the
meetings
begun

sir

thank
you
mr

president
have
a
seat

hank
homeland
security
was
tracking
magneto
we
got
hits
in
lisbon

geneva

montreal
navsat
lost
him
crossing
the
border

but
we
did
get
a
consolation
prize
we
picked
her
up
breaking
into
the
fda
you
know
who
shes
been
imitating
secretary
trask
here
yes

sir

she
can
do
that
not
any
more

she
cant

we
got
her

you
think
your
prisons
can
hold
her
we
have
some
new
prisons

well
keep
them
mobile

be
a
step
ahead
where
is
magneto
raven
raven

i
asked
you
a
question

i
dont
answer
to
my
slave
name
raven
darkholme

thats
your
real
name

isnt
it
or
has
he
convinced
you
you
dont
have
a
family
any
more
my
family
tried
to
kill
me

you
pathetic
meat
sack
ok

then

mystique
where
is
he
in
here
with
us
i
dont
want
to
play
games
with
you

i
want
answers
you
dont
want
to
play
games
with
me
you
are
going
to
stop
this

tell
me

where
is
magneto
you
wanna
know
where
he
is
homo
sapien
you
know

her
capture
will
only
provoke
magneto
but
having
her
does
give
us
some
diplomatic
leverage
on
principle

i
cant
negotiate
with
these
people
i
thought
thats
why
you
appointed
me

sir

yes

it
is
but
thats
not
why
you
called
me
here

no

this
is
its
what
she
stole
from
the
fda
dear
lord
is
it
viable
we
believe
it
is
you
realize
the
impact
thisll
have
on
the
mutant
community
yes

i
do

thats
precisely
why
we
need
some
of
your
diplomacy
now
when
an
individual
acquires
great
power
the
use
or
misuse
of
that
power
is
everything
will
it
be
for
the
greater
good
or
will
it
be
used
for
personal
or
for
destructive
ends
now

this
is
a
question
we
must
all
ask
ourselves
why
because
we
are
mutants
for
psychics

this
presents
a
particular
problem
when
is
it
acceptable
to
use
our
power
and
when
do
we
cross
that
invisible
line
that
turns
us
into
tyrants
over
our
fellow
man
but
einstein
said
that
ethics
are
an
exclusive
human
concern
without
any
superhuman
authority
behind
it
einstein
wasnt
a
mutant
so
far
as
we
know
this
case
study
was
sent
to
me
by
a
colleague

dr

moira
mctaggert

jones
the
man
you
see
here
was
born
with
no
higherlevel
brain
functions
his
organs
and
nervous
system
work

but
he
has
no
consciousness
to
speak
of
what
if
we
were
to
transfer
the
consciousness
of
one
person
say
a
father
of
four
with
terminal
cancer
into
the
body
of
this
man
how
are
we
to
decide
what
falls
within
the
range
of
ethical
behavior
and
what
professor
well
continue
this
tomorrow

class
dismissed
the
forecast
was
for
sunny
skies
i
dont
have
to
be
psychic
to
see
that
somethings
bothering
you
i
dont
understand

magnetos
a
fugitive
weve
a
mutant
in
the
cabinet

a
president
who
understands
us
why
hide
were
not
hiding

but
we
still
have
enemies

i
must
protect
my
students

you
know
that
yes

but
we
cant
be
students
forever
storm

i
havent
thought
of
you
as
my
student
for
years
in
fact

i
thought
that
perhaps
you
might
take
my
place
some
day
but
scotts
scotts
a
changed
man
he
took
jeans
death
so
hard
yes

things
are
better
out
there
but
you

of
all
people

know
how
fast
the
weather
can
change
theres
something
youre
not
telling
us
hank
ororo

charles
i
love
what
youve
done
with
your
hair
you
too

thank
you
for
seeing
me
on
such
short
notice
henry

you
are
always
welcome
here

youre
a
part
of
this
place
i
have
news

is
it
eric
no

though
we
have
been
making
some
progress
on
that
front
mystique
was
recently
apprehended

whos
the
fur
ball
hank
mccoy

secretary
of
mutant
affairs
right

right

the
secretary

nice
suit
henry

this
is
logan

hes
wolverine
i
hear
youre
quite
an
animal

look
whos
talking
magnetos
gonna
come
get
mystique
magnetos
not
the
problem

at
least
not
our
most
pressing
one
a
major
pharmaceutical
company
has
developed
a
mutant
antibody
a
way
to
suppress
the
mutant
x
gene
suppress
permanently
theyre
calling
it
a
cure
thats
ridiculous

you
cant
cure
being
a
mutant
scientifically
speaking
when
did
we
become
a
disease
storm
theyre
announcing
it
now
these
socalled
mutants
are
people
just
like
us
their
affliction
is
nothing
more
than
a
disease
a
corruption
of
healthy
cellular
activity
but
i
stand
here
today
to
tell
you
that
theres
hope
this
site

once
the
worlds
most
famous
prison
will
now
be
the
source
of
freedom
for
all
mutants
who
choose
it
i
proudly
present
the
answer
to
mutation
finally

we
have
a
cure
who
would
want
this
cure
i
mean

what
kind
of
coward
would
take
it
just
to
fit
in
is
it
cowardice
to
save
oneself
from
persecution
not
all
of
us
can
fit
in
so
easily
you
dont
shed
on
the
furniture

the
government
probably
cooked
this
up
the
government
had
nothing
to
do
with
it

ive
heard
that
before
my
boy

i
have
been
fighting
for
mutant
rights
since
before
you
had
claws
did
he
just
call
me
boy
is
it
true
they
can
cure
us
yes

rogue

it
appears
to
be
true
no

professor
they
cant
cure
us
you
wanna
know
why
because
theres
nothing
to
cure

nothings
wrong
with
you
or
any
of
us

for
that
matter
how
should
we

as
mutants

respond
heres
what
i
think
this
is
about
getting
organized

bringing
our
complaints
to
the
right
people
we
need
to
put
together
a
committee
and
talk
to
the
government
they
dont
understand

they
dont
know
what
it
means
to
be
a
mutant
we
need
to
show
them

educate
them

let
them
know
that
were
here
to
stay
people

you
must
listen

they
wont
take
us
seriously
they
wanna
exterminate
us

this
cure
is
voluntary
nobody
is
talking
about
extermination
no
one
ever
talks
about
it
they
just
do
it
and
youll
go
on
with
your
lives
ignoring
the
signs
all
around
you
and
then
one
day

when
the
air
is
still
and
the
night
has
fallen

they
come
for
you
then
you
realize

while
youre
talking
about
organizing
and
committees
the
extermination
has
already
begun
make
no
mistake

my
brothers

they
will
draw
first
blood
they
will
force
their
cure
upon
us
the
only
question
is

will
you
join
my
brotherhood
and
fight
or
wait
for
the
inevitable
genocide
who
will
you
stand
with
the
humans
or
us
you
talk
pretty
tough
for
a
guy
in
a
cape
back
off
if
youre
so
proud
of
being
a
mutant

wheres
your
mark
i
have
been
marked
once

my
dear

let
me
assure
you
no
needle
shall
ever
touch
my
skin
again
you
know
who
youre
talking
to
and
what
can
you
do
so

have
talents
that
and
more

you
control
metal
and
i
know
theres

mutants

secretary
mccoy

to
worthington
labs
thank
you

dr

rao

not
an
easy
place
to
get
to
its
the
safest
location
we
could
find

thats
why
we
keep
the
source
of
the
cure
here
he
is
a
mutant

you
understand
our
concern
we
are
in
compliance
with
your
policy

how
long
will
you
keep
the
boy
here
until
we
can
fully
map
his
dna

we
can
replicate
it

but
we
cant
generate
it
and
his
power
what
is
its
range
youll
see
jimmy
theres
someone
i
would
like
you
to
meet
hello
there

son
hi

my
name
is
hank
mccoy
its
ok
you
have
an
amazing
gift

thank
you

jimmy
extraordinary

isnt
he

is
can
you
hear
me
im
still
here

scott

stop
im
here

scott

scott

stop
it
scott

scott

stop
it
i
need
you

scott

scott

scott
jean
how
i
wanna
see
your
eyes
take
these
off

no
trust
me

i
can
control
it
now
open
them

you
cant
hurt
me
what
happened
no
clue
professor

are
you
ok
get
to
alkali
lake
you
dont
want
to
be
here

do
you
i
cant
see
a
damn
thing
i
can
take
care
of
that
the
sheer
mass
of
water
that
collapsed
on
top
of
jean
should
have
obliterated
her
the
only
explanation
of
jeans
survival
is
that
her
powers
wrapped
her
in
a
cocoon
of
telekinetic
energy
is
she
gonna
be
ok
jean
grey
is
the
only
class
five
mutant
ive
ever
encountered

her
potential
limitless
her
mutation
is
seated
in
the
unconscious
part
of
her
mind
and
therein
lay
the
danger
when
she
was
a
girl

i
created
a
series
of
psychic
barriers
to
isolate
her
powers
from
her
conscious
mind
jean
developed
a
dual
personality

what
the
conscious
jean

whose
powers
were
always
in
her
control

and
the
dormant
side
a
personality
that

in
our
sessions

came
to
call
itself
the
phoenix
a
purely
instinctual
creature

all
desire
and
joy
and
rage
she
knew
all
this
its
unclear
how
much
she
knew
far
more
critical
is
whether
the
woman
in
front
of
us
is
the
jean
grey
we
know
or
the
phoenix
furiously
struggling
to
be
free
she
looks
peaceful
to
me

im
keeping
her
that
way
im
trying
to
restore
the
psychic
blocks
and
cage
the
beast
again
what
have
you
done
to
her
you
have
to
understand
youre
talking
about
a
persons
mind
she
has
to
be
controlled

controlled
sometimes

when
you
cage
the
beast

the
beast
gets
angry
you
have
no
idea

you
have
no
idea
of
what
she
is
capable
no

professor

i
had
no
idea
what
you
were
capable
of
i
had
a
terrible
choice
to
make

i
chose
the
lesser
of
two
evils
it
sounds
to
me
like
jean
had
no
choice
at
all
i
dont
have
to
explain
myself

least
of
all
to
you
history
will
be
made
here
today

for
the
first
time
the
socalled
mutant
cure
will
be
available
to
the
public
reaction
has
run
the
gamut
with
mutants
on
both
sides
of
the
line
some
are
desperate
for
this
cure
while
others
are
offended
by
the
very
idea
of
it
will
secretary
mccoy
be
a
problem
hard
to
say

his
political
views
seem
somewhat
at

difference
thats
no
way
to
influence
policy
policy
is
being
made
without
me

mr

president
the
decision
to
turn
the
cure
into
a
weapon
was
made
without
me
what
happened
on
that
convoy
was
inexcusable

but
your
actions
that
was
an
isolated
incident

you
have
to
understand
those
mutants
were
a
real
threat
have
you
even
begun
to
think
what
a
slippery
slope
youre
on
i
have
and
i
worry
about
how
democracy
survives
when
one
man
can
move
cities
with
his
mind
as
do
i
you
and
i
know
that
its
only
going
to
get
worse
all
the
more
reason
why
i
need
to
be
where
i
belong

lightning
rod

charles
my
dear

come
with
me
god
we
live
in
an
age
of
darkness
a
world
full
of
fear

hate
and
intolerance
but
in
every
age

there
are
those
who
fight
against
it
charles
xavier
was
born
to
a
world
divided
a
world
he
tried
to
heal
a
mission
he
never
saw
accomplished
it
seems
the
destiny
of
great
men
to
see
their
goals
unfulfilled
charles
was
more
than
a
leader

more
than
a
teacher

he
was
a
friend
when
we
were
afraid

he
gave
us
strength
and
when
we
were
alone

he
gave
us
a
family
he
may
be
gone

but
his
teachings
live
on
through
us

his
students
wherever
we
may
go

we
must
carry
on
his
vision
and
thats
a
vision
of
a
world
united
kitty
you
ok
yeah
its
just
xavier
came
to
my
house
he
was
the
one
that
convinced
me
to
come
here
yeah

me
too
were
all
feeling
the
same
way

you
know

no

bobby

were
not
you
have
rogue
and
i
have
you
know

i
just
miss
home
the
first
snow
and
all
that
kitty

get
up

come
with
me

storm
told
us
to
stay
in
our
rooms
dont
worry

we
wont
get
caught
i
mean

you
can
walk
through
walls

you
know
this
place
can
be
home
too
thank
you
for
this

bobby
you
need
a
lift

kid
where
are
you
going
you
dont
know
what
its
like
to
be
afraid
of
your
powers

afraid
to
get
close
to
anybody
yeah

i
do
i
want
to
be
able
to
touch
people

logan
a
hug

a
handshake
a
kiss
i
hope
youre
not
doing
this
for
some
boy
look

if
you
wanna
go

then
go
just
be
sure
its
what
you
want
shouldnt
you
be
telling
me
to
stay
to
go
upstairs
and
unpack
im
not
your
father

im
your
friend
just
think
about
what
i
said

rogue
remember
when
we
first
met
do
you
know
what
i
saw
when
i
looked
at
you
i
saw
the
next
stage
in
evolution
both
charles
and
i
dreamt
of
finding
and
i
thought
to
myself

why
would
charles
want
to
turn
this
goddess
into
a
mortal
i
can
manipulate
the
metal
in
this
but
you

you
can
do
anything
anything
you
can
think
of
enough
you
sound
just
like
him
jean

he
wanted
to
hold
you
back
what
do
you
want
i
want
you
to
be
what
you
are
as
nature
intended
that
cure
is
meant
for
all
of
us

if
we
want
freedom

we
must
fight
for
it
and
that
fight
begins
now
she
shouldnt
be
here
with
us
her
power
is
completely
unstable

only
in
the
wrong
hands
and
you
trust
her
shes
one
of
them

so
were
you
once
i
stuck
with
you

would
have
killed
the
professor
if
youd
given
me
the
chance
charles
xavier
did
more
for
mutants
than
youll
ever
know
my
single
greatest
regret
is
that
he
had
to
die
for
our
dream
to
live
so
what
now
what
do
we
do
xavier
started
this
school

perhaps
its
best
that
it
end
with
him
well
tell
the
students
theyre
going
home

most
of
us
dont
have
anywhere
to
go
i
cant
believe
this

i
cant
believe
were
not
going
to
fight
for
this
school
im
sorry

i
know
this
is
a
bad
time
i
was
told
that
this
was
a
safe
place
for
mutants

use
this
poison
against
them

as
you
wish
my
god

forgive
me
in
the
sacristy
the
church
of
saintsulpice

is
the
rose
line
beneath
the
rose
symbols
are
a
language
that
can
help
us
understand
our
past
as
the
saying
goes

a
picture
says
a
thousand
words
but
which
words
interpret
for
me

please

this
symbol

first
thing
that
comes
to
mind
hatred

racism

ku
klux
klan
yes

yes

interesting

but
they
would
disagree
with
you
in
spain
there

they
are
robes
worn
by
priests
now
this
symbol

anyone
evil
in
english

please
devils
pitchfork
poor

poor
poseidon
that
is
his
trident

a
symbol
of
power
to
millions
of
the
ancients
now
this
symbol
madonna
and
child

faith

christianity
no

no

its
the
pagan
god
horus
and
his
mother

isis
centuries
before
the
birth
of
christ
understanding
our
past
determines
actively
so
how
do
we
sift
truth
from
belief
how
do
we
write
our
own
histories

personally
or
culturally
and
thereby
define
ourselves
how
do
we
penetrate
years

centuries

of
historical
distortion
tonight

this
will
be
our
quest
my
son
is
a
student
of
yours
at
harvard
michael
culp
he
adores
you

oh

yeah
he
says
youre
the
best
teacher
hes
ever
had
ms

culp

i
think
i
already
gave
michael
an
aminus
he
told
me

thank
you
mr

langdon
bonjour

professor
im
lieutenant
collet
from
dcpj

a
kind
of
french
fbi
will
you
take
a
look
at
this
photo

please
my
police
chief

capitaine
fache

had
hoped
considering
your
expertise
and
the
markings
on
the
body
you
might
assist
us
will
you
excuse
me
a
moment
i
was
supposed
to
have
drinks
with
him
yes

we
know
we
found
your
name
in
his
daily
planner
he
never
showed

i
waited
for
over
an
hour
why
would
someone
do
this
to
him
oh

you
misunderstand

professor
he
was
shot

yes
but
what
you
see
in
the
photograph
monsieur
sauni�re
did
to
himself
teacher

all
four
are
dead
the
s�n�chaux
and
the
grand
master
himself
then
i
assume
you
have
the
location
confirmed
by
all
independently
i
had
feared
the
priorys
penchant
for
secrecy
might
prevail
the
prospect
of
death
is
strong
motivation
it
is
here
in
paris

teacher
it
hides
beneath
the
rose
in
saintsulpice
you
will
go
forth

silas
i
chastise
my
body
capitaine
fache
is
waiting
for
you
okay
mr

langdon

yes
im
captain
bezu
fache
you
like
our
pyramid
its
magnificent
a
scar
on
the
face
of
paris
after
me

please
its
the
pairing
of
those
two
pyramids
its
unique
the
two
are
geometric
echoes
fascinating
im
not
sure
how
much
help
im
gonna
be
here
this
evening
how
well
did
you
know
the
curator
not
very
well
frankly

i
was
surprised
when
he
contacted
me
could
we
take
the
stairs
so
sauni�re
requested
tonights
meeting
how
did
he
call
you
e
mail

he
heard
i
was
in
paris
had
something
to
discuss
you
seem
uncomfortable
the
grand
gallery

this
is
where
you
found
the
body
how
would
you
know
that
i
recognize
the
parquet
floor
from
the
polaroid

its
unmistakable
lets
cover
the
talking
points
again

your
eminence
many
call
opus
dei
a
brainwashing
cult
others

an
ultraconservative
christian
secret
society
obviously

some
people
fear
what
they
dont
understand
perhaps
a
less
defensive
tack

your
eminence
the
press
continue
to
be
harsh
with
us
we
are
not
cafeteria
catholics
we
dont
pick
and
choose
which
rules
to
follow
we
follow
doctrine

rigorously
does
doctrine
necessarily
include
vows
of
chastity

tithing
and
atonement
for
sins
through
selfflagellation
and
the
cilice
many
of
our
followers
are
married

many
of
them
have
families
only
a
small
proportion
choose
to
live
ascetic
lives
why
are
some
media
referring
that
will
be
all

michael

thank
you
aringarosa
silas
has
succeeded

the
legend
is
true
it
hides
beneath
the
rose
my
part
of
our
bargain
is
nearly
fulfilled
i
meet
the
council
in
an
hour
i
will
have
your
money
tonight

teacher
the
vitruvian
man
its
one
of
leonardo
da
vincis
most
famous
sketches
and
the
star
on
his
skin
a
pentacle
and
its
meaning
the
pentacle
is
a
pagan
religious
icon
devil
worship
no

no

no

no

the
pentacle
before
that
this
is
a
symbol
for
venus
it
represents
the
female
half
of
all
things
you
are
telling
me
that
sauni�res
last
act
on
earth
was
to
draw
a
goddess
symbol
on
his
chest
why
captain
fache

obviously
i
cant
tell
you
why
i
can
tell
you
he

as
well
as
anyone

knows
the
meaning
of
this
symbol
and
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
worshiping
the
devil
is
that
so
yes
then
what
do
you
make
of
this
o

draconian
devil

oh

lame
saint
its
a
phrase

doesnt
mean
anything

not
to
me
what
would
you
do

limited

fache

detain
you

be
useless
stop
it
just
stop

at
the
letters
ps

postscript
princesse
sophie

silly

i
know
but
i
was
only
a
girl
when
i
lived
with
him
jacques
sauni�re
was
my
grandfather
apparently

it
was
his
dying
wish
that
we
meet
if
you
help
me
understand
why
i
will
get
you
to
your
embassy

where
we
cannot
arrest
you
fache
was
never
gonna
let
me
just
stroll
out
of
here

was
he
if
we
are
to
get
away
from
here

we
must
find
another
way
what
exactly
do
you
propose
sauni�re
was
reading
his
book
excuse
me

captain
we
have
a
problem
headquarters
didnt
send
sophie
neveu
captain

look
at
this
he
jumped
hes
moving
again

and
fast
he
must
be
in
a
car
hes
going
south
on
pont
du
carrousel
bastard
that
cop
will
check
the
whole
lower
floor
i
will
only
take
a
moment
he
is
much
older
than
i
remember
i
hadnt
seen
or
spoken
to
him
in
a
very
long
time
he
phoned
my
office
today

several
times
he
said
it
was
a
matter
of
life
and
death
i
thought
it
was
another
trick
to
get
back
in
touch
it
seems
when
he
couldnt
speak
to
me
he
reached
out
to
you
wait
a
minute

professor
this
is
wrong

yeah

see
this
is
wrong
the
fibonacci
numbers
only
make
sense
when
theyre
in
order
these
are
scrambled
if
he
was
trying
to
reach
out

maybe
he
was
doing
it
in
code
would
you
hold
this

please
this
phrase
is
meaningless
unless
you
assume
these
letters
are
out
of
order
too
an
anagram
you
have
eidetic
memory
not
quite

but
i
can
pretty
much
remember
what
i
see
anagram
is
right
o

draconian

admire
him
now

stupid

who
did
we
leave
at
the
museum
ledoux
get
him
on
the
radio
her
smile
is
in
the
lower
spatial
frequencies
the
horizon
is
significantly
lower
on
the
left
than
it
is
on
the
right
well

see

she
appears
larger
from
the
left
than
on
the
right
historically

the
left
was
female

the
right
was
male
there

blood
so
dark

professor

piece
of
a
ufo
from
area
whats
the
next
step
with
him

its
always
sophie

whats
the
next
step
puzzles
codes
a
treasure
hunt
to
find
his
killer
maybe
there
is
something
about
this
priory
of
sion
i
hope
not
any
priory
story
ends
in
bloodshed

they
were
butchered
by
the
church
it
all
started
over
a
thousand
years
ago
when
a
french
king
this
crusade

one
of
the
most
massive
and
sweeping
in
history
was
actually
orchestrated
by
a
secret
brotherhood
the
priory
of
sion
and
their
military
arm

the
knights
templar
but
the
templars
were
created
to
protect
the
holy
land
that
was
a
cover
to
hide
their
true
goal

according
to
this
myth
supposedly
the
invasion
was
to
find
an
artefact
lost
since
the
time
of
christ
an
artefact

it
was
said

the
church
would
kill
to
possess
did
they
find
it

this
buried
treasure
put
it
this
way
one
day
the
templars
simply
stopped
searching
they
quit
the
holy
land
and
travelled
directly
to
rome
whether
they
blackmailed
the
papacy
or
the
church
bought
their
silence

no
one
knows
but
it
is
a
fact
the
papacy
declared
these
priory
knights
these
knights
templar

of
limitless
power
by
the
s

the
templars
had
grown
too
powerful
too
threatening
so
the
vatican
issued
secret
orders
to
be
opened
simultaneously
all
across
europe
the
pope
had
declared
the
knights
templar
satan
worshipers
and
said
god
had
charged
him
with
cleansing
the
earth
of
these
heretics
the
plan
went
off
like
clockwork
the
templars
were
all
but
exterminated
the
date
was
october
th



a
friday
friday
the
th
the
pope
sent
troops
to
claim
the
priorys
treasure
but
they
found
nothing
the
few
surviving
knights
of
the
priory
had
vanished
and
the
search
for
their
sacred
artefact
began
again
what
artefact
ive
never
heard
about
any
of
this
yes

you
have
almost
everyone
on
earth
has
you
just
know
it
as
the
holy
grail
please

sauni�re
thought
he
knew
the
location
of
the
holy
grail
maybe
more
than
that
this
cross
and
the
flower

this
could
be
very
old

but
look
this
metal
here
underneath
is
much
newer

and
theres
a
modern
id
stamp
haxo
and
these
dots

these
dots
are
read
by
a
laser
this
is
more
than
a
pendant

this
is
a
key
your
grandfather
left
you
he
left
us

professor
and
vingtquatre
haxo

its
not
an
id
stamp

sister
hitherto
shalt
thou
come
but
no
further
do
you
mock
me
where
is
the
keystone
you
are
a
sister
of
the
church
and
yet
you
serve
them
the
priory
jesus
had
but
one
true
message

that
come

you
saints
of
god
hasten

angels
of
the
lord

bishop
this

is
convened

business

say
you
as
you
know

my
request
for
funds
yes


million
euro
in
untraceable
bearer
bonds
a
tad
more
than
petty
cash

wouldnt
you
say

bishop
i
only
offer
a
route
to
the
renewal
of
faith
for
all
men
how
humble
our
saviour

bishop
aringarosa
how
dare
you
presume
to
i
do
not
presume

i
act
the
vaticans
unwillingness
to
support
us
is
both
impious
and
cowardly
blood
is
being
spilled
because
true
christian
values
lie
in
ruins

no
more
this
council
has
forgotten
its
very
purpose
tonight
the
grail
will
be
destroyed
the
priorys
few
remaining
members
will
be
silenced
i
was
contacted
by
a
man
who
calls
himself
only
the
teacher
two
prostitutes
identified
langdon
and
neveu
getting
into
a
taxi
in
the
bois
de
boulogne

of
your
expertise

sorry
about
the
priory
do
you
think
thats
why
sauni�re
sought
you

can
think
of
dozens
of
scholars
who
know
a
lot
more
about
it
actually

i
didnt
think
he
liked
me
very
much
once
made
a
joke
at
my
expense

got
a
big
laugh

the
holy

you
a
godfearing
man

professor
i
was
raised
a
catholic
well

thats
not
really
an
answer
professor

are
you
okay
go
ahead

open
it
a
cryptex
they
are
used
to
keep
secrets
its
da
vincis
design
you
write
the
information
on
a
papyrus
scroll
which
is
then
rolled
around
a
thin
glass
vial
of
vinegar
if
you
force
it
open

the
vial
breaks
vinegar
dissolves
papyrus
and
your
secret
is
lost
forever
the
only
way
to
access
the
information
is
to
spell
out
the
password
with
these
five
dials

each
with

letters
thats

million
possibilities
ive
never
met
a
girl
who
knew
that
much
about
a
cryptex
sauni�re
made
one
for
me
once
my
grandfather
gave
me
a
wagon
this
clearly
is
not
the
holy
grail
please

youre
not
all
right
may
i
try
something
i
dont
know
why
it
works
my
mother
used
to
do
it
when
i
was
scared

i
think
you
think
feeling
better

sophie
my
parents
died
in
a
car
crash
with
my
brother
i
was
it
was
many
years
ago
twenty
years
waiting
for
someone
to
come
for
that
box
and
now
its
you
two
murderers

bring
it
to
me
i
dont
know
what
youre
talking
about

grave
of
inquiries

about
the
priory
of
sion
the
keepers
the
secret
war
sorry
for
all
the
mystery
leigh

im
into
something
here
that
i
cannot
understand
really
not
without
your
help
playing
to
my
vanity

robert

you
should
be
ashamed
not
if
it
works
there
are
always
four
the
grand
master
and
the
three
s�n�chaux
make
up
the
primary
guardians
of
the
grail
thank
you

remy

thatll
be
all
for
now
the
priorys
members
span
our
very
globe
itself
philippe
de
ch�risey
exposed
that
as
a
hoax
in
and
that
is
what
they
want
you
to
believe
the
priory
is
charged
with
a
single
task
to
protect
the
greatest
secret
in
modern
history
the
source
of
gods
power
on
earth
no

thats
a
common
misunderstanding
the
priory
protects
the
source
of
the
churchs
power
on
earth
i
dont
understand
what
power
some
magic
dishes
robert

has
he
been
telling
you
that
the
holy
grail
is
a
cup
the
good
book
did
not
arrive
by
facsimile
from
heaven
the
bible
as
we
know
it
was
finally
presided
over
by
one
man
the
pagan
emperor
constantine
i
thought
constantine
was
a
christian
oh

hardly

no

he
was
a
lifelong
pagan
who
was
baptized
on
his
deathbed
constantine
was
romes
supreme
holy
man
from
time
immemorial
his
people
had
worshiped
a
balance
between
natures
male
deities
but
a
growing
religious
turmoil
was
gripping
rome
three
centuries
earlier
a
young
jew
named
jesus
had
come
along
preaching
love
and
a
single
god
centuries
after
his
crucifixion
and
had
started
a
religious
war
against
the
pagans
or
did
the
pagans
commence
war
against
the
christians
leigh

we
cant
be
sure
who
began
the
atrocities
in
that
period
we
can
at
least
agree
that
the
conflict
grew
to
such
proportions
that
it
threatened
to
tear
rome
in
two
so
constantine
may
have
been
a
lifelong
pagan
and
in

anno
domini
he
decided
to
unify
rome
under
a
single
religion

christianity
christianity
was
on
the
rise

he
didnt
want
his
empire
torn
apart
and
to
strengthen
this
new
christian
tradition
constantine
held
a
famous
ecumenical
gathering
known
as
the
council
of
nicaea
and
at
this
council
the
many
sects
of
christianity
debated
and
v
oted
on

well
everything

from
the
acceptance
and
rejection
of
specific
gospels
to
the
date
for
easter
to
the
administering
of
the
sacraments

and
of
course
the
immortality
of
jesus
i
dont
follow
well

ma
ch�re

until
that
moment
in
history
jesus
was
viewed
by
many
of
his
followers
as
a
mighty
prophet
as
a
great
and
powerful
man

but
a
man
nevertheless
a
mortal
man
not
the
son
of
god
not
even
his
nephew
twice
removed
constantine
did
not
create
jesus
divinity
he
simply
sanctioned
an
already
widely
held
idea
semantics

no

its
not
semantics
youre
interpreting
facts
to
support
your
own
conclusions
fact
for
many
christians

jesus
was
mortal
one
day
and
divine
the
next
for
some
christians

his
divinity
was
enhanced
absurd

there
was
a
formal
announcement
of
his
promotion
they
couldnt
even
agree
on
the
nicene
creed
excuse
me

who
is
god

who
is
man
how
many
have
been
murdered
over
this
question
as
long
as
there
has
been
a
one
true
god
there
has
been
killing
in
his
name
now
let
me
show
you
the
grail
i
trust
you
recognize
the
last
supper
the
great
fresco
by
leonardo
da
vinci
now

my
dear

if
you
would
close
your
eyes
oh

leigh

save
us
the
parlour
tricks
you
asked
for
my
help

i
recall
allow
an
old
man
his
indulgences
now

mademoiselle

where
is
jesus
sitting
in
the
middle

good
he
and
his
disciples
are
breaking
bread
and
what
drink
wine

they
drank
wine
splendid

and
one
final
question
how
many
wineglasses
are
there
on
the
table
one
the
holy
grail
open
your
eyes
no
single
cup
no
chalice
well

thats
a
bit
strange

isnt
it
considering
both
the
bible
and
standard
grail
legend
celebrate
this
moment
as
the
definitive
arrival
of
the
holy
grail
now

robert

you
could
be
of
help
to
us
if
youd
be
so
kind
as
to
show
us
the
symbols
for
man
and
woman

please
no
balloon
animals

i
can
make
a
great
duck
this
is
the
original
icon
for
male

its
a
rudimentary
phallus
quite
to
the
point

yes

indeed
this
is
known
as
the
blade
it
represents
aggression
and
manhood
its
a
symbol
still
used
today
in
modern
military
uniforms
yes

the
more
penises
you
have

the
higher
your
rank

boys
will
be
boys
now

as
you
would
imagine

the
female
symbol
is
its
exact
opposite
this
is
called
the
chalice
and
the
chalice
resembles
a
cup
or
vessel
or

more
importantly
the
shape
of
a
womans
womb
no

the
grail
has
never
been
a
cup
it
is
quite
literally
this
ancient
symbol
of
womanhood
and
in
this
case

a
woman
who
carried
a
secret
so
powerful
that
if
revealed

it
would
devastate
the
very
foundations
of
christianity
wait

please
youre
saying
the
holy
grail
is
a
person
a
woman
and
it
turns
out

she
makes
an
appearance
right
there
but
they
are
all
men
what
about
that
figure
on
the
right
hand
of
our
lord
flowing
red
hair
folded
feminine
hands
hint
of
a
bosom

no
its
called
scotoma

the
mind
sees
what
it
chooses
to
see
my
dear

thats
mary
magdalene
the
prostitute
she
was
no
such
thing
smeared
by
the
church
in

anno
domini

poor
dear
mary
magdalene
was
jesus
wife
this
is
an
old
wives
tale
the
original
one

in
fact
theres
virtually
no
empirical
proof
he
knows
as
well
as
i
do
theres
much
evidence
to
support
it
theories

there
are
theories
notice
how
jesus
and
mary
are
clothed
mirror
images
of
each
other
the
mind
sees
what
it
chooses
to
see
and
venturing
into
the
even
more
bizarre

notice
how
jesus
and
mary
appear
to
be
joined
at
the
hip
and
are
leaning
away
from
each
other
as
if
to
create
a
shape
in
the
negative
space
between
them
leonardo
gives
us
the
chalice
yes

oh

and
robert

notice
what
happens
when
these
two
figures
change
position
just
because
da
vinci
painted
it
doesnt
make
it
true
no

but
history
she
does
make
it
true
now

listen
to
this

its
from
the
gospel
according
to
philip
yes

it
was
rejected
at
the
council
of
nicaea
along
with
any
other
gospels
that
made
and
the
companion
of
the
saviour
is
mary
magdalene
christ
loved
her
more
than
all
the
disciples
and
used
to
kiss
her
on
the
but
this
says
nothing
of
marriage
well

actually
actually

in
those
days

the
word
companion
literally
meant
spouse
and
this
is
from
the
gospel
of
mary
magdalene
herself
she
wrote
a
gospel
she
may
have
robert

will
you
fight
fair
she
may
have
and
peter
said

did
he
prefer
her
to
us
and
levi
answered
peter

i
see
you
contending
against
a
woman
like
an
adversary
if
the
saviour
made
her
worthy

who
are
you

indeed

to
reject
her
yes

and
then

my
dear

jesus
goes
on
to
tell
mary
magdalene
that
its
up
to
her
to
continue
his
church
mary
magdalene

not
peter
the
church
was
supposed
to
be
carried
on
by
a
woman
few
realize
that
mary
was
descended
from
kings

just
as
her
husband
was
now

my
dear

the
word
in
french
for
holy
grail
from
the
middle
english
sangreal
of
the
original
arthurian
legend
now

as
two
words

can
you
translate
for
our
friend
sang
real

it
means
royal
blood
when
the
legend
speaks
of
the
chalice
that
held
the
blood
of
christ
it
speaks
in
fact
of
the
female
womb
that
carried
jesus
royal
bloodline
but
how
could
christ
have
a
bloodline

unless
mary
was
pregnant
at
the
time
of
the
crucifixion
for
her
own
safety
and
for
that
of
christs
unborn
child
she
fled
the
holy
land
and
came
to
france
and
here

it
is
said

she
gave
birth
to
a
daughter

sarah
they
know
the
childs
name
a
little
girl

yes
if
that
were
true

its
adding
insult
to
injury
the
pagans
found
transcendence
through
the
joining
of
male
to
female
people
found
god
through
sex
in
paganism

women
were
worshiped
as
a
route
to
heaven
but
the
modern
church
has
a
monopoly
on
that
in
salvation
through
jesus
christ
and
he
who
keeps
the
keys
to
heaven
rules
the
world
women

then

are
a
huge
threat
to
the
church
the
catholic
inquisition
soon
publishes
the
malleus
maleficarum
the
witches
hammer
it
instructed
the
clergy
on
how
to
locate

torture
and
kill
all
freethinking
women
in
three
centuries
of
witch
hunts
women
are
captured

burned
alive
at
the
stak
e
oh

at
least
that

some
say
millions
imagine

then

robert
that
christs
throne
might
live
on
in
a
female
child
you
asked
what
would
be
worth
killing
for
witness
the
greatest
coverup
in
human
history
this
is
the
secret
that
the
priory
of
sion
they
are
the
guardians
of
the
royal
bloodline
the
keepers
of
the
proof
of
our
true
past
they
are
the
protectors
of
the
living
descendants
of
jesus
christ
and
mary
magdalene

in
flux

you

youre
just
like
my
girlfriend

my
exgirlfriend
theyre
the
criminals

theyre
the
bad
guys
can
i
have
a
go
there
dont
you
just
love
a
mac
sweet

huh
and
what
do
you
say
to
your
girlfriend
im
the
old
bill

will

you
know
ive
been
on
the
beat

undercover

in
a
suit
you
know

its
the
law
its

uh

einsteins
law
of
relativity
what
does
that
mean

exactly

sir
relativity
well

relatively
speaking

um

it
means

if
me
and
sandy
here
break
the
law

you
know

were
gonna
get
a
decent
lawyer
now
these
guys
who
broke
in
here
they
go
straight
to
jail

do
not
pass
go
one
law
for
us

one
for
them
except
we
havent
broken
the
law
everyones
broken
the
law
our
vision
for
kings
cross
for
the
public
spaces
of
kings
cross

starts
with
the
premise
that
we
acknowledge
an
urban
landscape
is
a
built
landscape
it
starts
as
an
argument
with
societys
phony
love
affair
with
nature
we
are
against
the
mistaking
of
grass
for
nature
of
green
for
nature
kings
cross
is
an
area
of
north
london
associated
with
poverty

crime

vice
and
urban
decay
our
job
is
to
transform
the
landscape
not
decorate
it
with
green
because
how
we
feel
about
ourselves

how
we
behave
is
directly
affected
by
the
space
around
us
how
we
design
the
outdoors
of
our
city
is
as
important
as
how
we
design
the
indoors
were
gonna
take
the
canal

and
use
it
like
calligraphy
like
ink

to
write
around
the
development
we
think
its
the
cleaners
what
about
the
cleaners
breaking
in
they
dont
even
clean
properly
its
true

they
dont
they
never
empty
the
dishwasher
or
load
it

for
that
matter
they
bring
their
kids

their
boyfriends
come
on

they
do
and
to
be
honest

will
its
getting
a
little
traumatic
im
staying
late
at
the
office
and
worrying
that
the
place
is
gonna
be
ransacked
while
im
in
it
look

theyre
cleaners
and
theyre
not
clean
good

thanks
thanks
for
the
tea

thanks
for
the
theory
im
sorry

but
what
does
that
mean
it
means
your
boyfriends
been
to
the
office

ruby
and
yours

wei
ping
and
yours

actually

joe
so
where
do
the
rules
say
we
can
have
boyfriends
but
the
cleaners
cant
or
kids
and
explain
this
to
me

please
how
the
cleaners
are
getting
up
onto
the
roof
then
swinging
through
the
roof
line

and
why
they
are
when
theyve
already
got
the
keys
and
codes
ive
just
been
trying
to
defend
our
cleaners
well

ive
just
spoken
to
the
alarm
company
whoever
broke
in
used
the
cleaners
code
what
do
we
actually
do
if
we
see
a
burglar
call
the
police
kill
them
theres
a
weird
ecology
of
course

to
these
breakins
the
new
computers

theyre
upgrades
you
know

theyre
new
models
you
could
argue
that
a
breakin
every

oh

say

six
months
its
good
business

isnt
it
just
not
every
six
days
i
wish
they
would
steal
this
car

for
instance
miles
ive
got
the
criminal
mind
lots
of
wanting
to
be
bad
see
an
ass

want
to
bite
it
i
just
never
do
what
youve
done

there
is
you
strayed
from
the
moral
to
the
criminal
and
you
crossed
the
moralcriminal
divide
wanting
to
bite
an
ass
is
a
moral
issue
and
then
only
if
the
ass
belongs
to
someone
who
objects
to
the
idea
criminal
would
be
biting
the
ass
without
permission
youre
such
a
lawyer
anyway

then
what
then
what

what
you
bite
the
ass

then
what
well

then
they
bite
yours
is
the
theory
its
so
long
since
ive
bitten
or
been
bit
its
good
to
talk
about
that
mm
the
problem
is

you
find
out

all
so
miserable

look
happy

have
this
light
box
what
kind
of
light
box
for
depression
the
doctor
prescribed

i
sit
in
front
of
it
for
hours
its
supposed
to
stop
me
from
getting
down
give
me
an
image
of
that
change
that
you
hope
for
in
will
hes
looking
at
me
sugar
uh

no

thank
you
i
think
youll
want
sugar
are
you
unhappy
what
makes
you
say
that
you
always
seem

when
you
come
here

i
dont
know
im
happy
enough
happy
enough
so
english
i
think
it
was
the
happiest
day

really
when
bea
was
born
and
then
sometimes
i
think
sometimes
i
think
bea
was
punished
because
i
left
my
husband
and
i
left
sweden
and
then
i
met
will

and
he
was
kind
and
we
were
happy

we
really
were
but
then
i
just
push
him
away

i
dont
know
why
i
just
push
him
away
from
me
oh

this
is

um

this
is
going
to
sound
really
stupid
i
forgot
the
shirt
i
was
going
to
bring
a
shirt
for
you

you
to
copy
and
i
forgot

i
forgot
it
um

all
right
should
i
go
back
and
get
it
i
can
go
back
and
get
it
now
and
id
be

like

two
seconds
or
perhaps
when
you
come
for
the
suit
its
a
bad
time
you
mean
without
the
shirt
right

that
doesnt
make
any
sense

does
it
im
going
to
the
supermarket
right

i
have
to
go
to
work
how
do
you
get
the
shopping
home
uh

bus
im
practically
driving
a
bus
my
cars
stolen

so
i
have
a
company
van
its
electric
you
could
probably
walk
faster
pedestrians
will
overtake
us
say
yes

and
whats
the
worst
thing
that
could
happen
tell
me
about
your
son
mirsad
mirsad
he
hates
his
name
but
was
a
name
for
sarajevo

not
for
london
now
his
names
miro
but
i
think
he
should
love
his
name
you
know

names
in
my
country
theyre
like
flags
you
can
live
or
die
because
of
your
name
mirsad
its
a
muslim
name
it
should
be
serbian
because
of
his
father
but

you
know

i
can
be
stubborn
sometimes
you
what
stubborn
sometimes
but
that
name
saved
his
life
when
we

when
we
were
getting
out
of
sarajevo

we
came
out
with
red
cross

leaving
the
siege
the
guards

the
serbs

stopped
us
at
one
of
the
checkpoints
and
they
took
him

they
took
my
son
and
they
said
whats
your
name
and
he
said

mirsad

my
name
is
mirsad

his
muslim
name
well

if
he
told
his
family
name
the
serbian
name

simic
they
might
have
taken
him
as
a
son
of
a
traitor
anyway

since
then

i
dont
think
hes
ever
really
hehe
gets
in
trouble
thats
another
story
i
cant
talk
about
siege
in
supermarket

sorry
we
had
a
breakin
several

actually

in
our
office
something
gets
smashed
i
mean

i
mean

not
just
the
windows
but
not
all
breakings
bad

is
it

you
know
i
mean

you
break
habits
maybe

maybe
before
you
repair
the
window
you
should
smash
a
few
more
thats
all
i
do

you
see

in
my
job

i
tidy
up
theres
a
mess
between
buildings

and
we
come
in
squeeze
in
bits
of
green

like
dressing
like
lipstick
like
pretty
anyway

thats
a
roundabout
way
of
saying
the
shape
of
your
mouth
i
could
probably
draw
it
by
heart
i
was
thinking

uh

that
was
a
roundabout
way
of
saying
youre
married

which
i
know
and
i
was
thinking
bosnian
men
would
say
less

but

uh
would
want
more
they
love
to
talk

they
love
talk

believe
me

but

uh
talk
for
them
is
politics

women
for
them
is
not
talk
thats
crushing
i
didnt
mean
it
bad
shes
going
to
be
disappointed

but
okay
yeah

i
have
to
take
the
boys
to
cricket
heres
mom
dad
cant
make
it
aw
but
heres
what
were
going
to
do
its
okay

look

sweet
why
cant
dad
come
because
hes
working

he
cant
make
it
in
time
he
never
comes
we
have
the
videos

video

video

video
hey
hoopla
stop

that
stop
there
is
very
good
i
know

i
realize
again

again
again
again
shes
great

eh
great
its
good

too
because
the
batteries
are
back
in
the
remote
its
a
mystery
how
these
batteries
finally
went
home
just
when
we
need
them

this
afternoon
im
sorry

im
sorry

im
sorry

its
me
who
should
be
saying
sorry
ive
been
looking
for
love
out
there
i
thought
i
might
have
found
it
and
did
you
i
think
i
might
have
lost
the
love
i
did
have
the
love
of
my
life
did
i
liv

i
need
to
tell
you
everything
i
need
to
tell
you
what
ive
done
i
thought
you
were
going
i
cant
go
i
slept
with
her
it
was
hard
enough
to
tell
you
that
last
night
that
was
bad
enough
without
saying
it
in
public
without
hurting
you
twice
when
you
hurt
this
much

you
cant
be
hurt
twice
i
was
looking
at
you
and
i
was
thinking
how
long
since
id
looked
at
you
i
dont
even
know
how
to
be
honest
maybe
thats
why
i
like
metaphors
because
what
i
want
to
say
is
theres
a
circle
yours
and
beas
and
im
not
in
it
but
thats
just
to
justify
it

because
theres
a
part
of
me
so
dark

that
sees
that
circle
as
a
cage
you
made
it
come
in
and
sit
down
im
sorry

there

um
ththis
is

theres
been
a
big
mistake
mistake
yeah

um
yeah

this
boy
is
definitely
not
the
burglar
i
know
him

and
i
know
his
i
know
his
mother
what
do
you
mean
you
know
them
they
came
to
our
office

they
came
to
the

well

how
can
that
be
you
were
told
their
names
yet
you
never
said
you
recognized
them
i
dont
remember
you
saying
the
name
simic
you
definitely
didnt
say
simic
miro
and
i
know
each
other
actually

very
well
um

interested
in
architecture
mrs

simic
he
is

yes
no

im
asking
is
it
true
that
you
and
mr
um

francis
francis
know
each
other
mr

francis
is

um

ive
done
some
work
for
him
adjusting
his
suit
i
think
this
mrs
amira
is
being
discreet
what
do
you
mean

discreet
amira
is
being
discreet
about
the
nature
of
our
relationship
which
was
not
an
appropriate
one
and
i
think
shes
trying
to
save
me
from
embarrassment
from
the
embarrassment
of
myself
and
my
family
and
thats
why
she

um

thats
why
shes
not
saying
shshe
came
to
the
office
with
miro
i
remember
it

though
it
was
the
day
of
the
last
burglary
and
miro
cut
his
hand
and
thats
obviously
where
the

uh
well

thats
where
the
dna
confusion
occurred
mr

hoffman
mr

hoffman

do
you
know
anything
about
this
no

no

i
cant
say
i
do
is
this
some
sort
of
i
mean

to
believe

met
both
of
them
at
the
office

i
dressed
the
boys

i
wai

i

your

she

going

but
shes
packing
some
call
bregna
the
perfect
society
some
call
it
the
height
of
human
civilization
but
others
know
better
the
goodchilds
built
bregna
to
ensure
us
a
future
they
built
the
relical
a
memorial
to
remind
us
of
what
weve
survived
they
built
walls
to
protect
us
they
tell
us
that
outside

nature
has
retaken
the
world
but
the
real
problems
lie
within
we
are
haunted
by
sorrows
we
cannot
name
people
disappear
and
our
government
denies
these
crimes
the
goodchild
regime
provides
for
us

as
long
as
we
stay
quiet
so
we
trade
freedom
for
a
gilded
cage
but
there
are
rebels
who
refuse
to
make
that
trade
who
fight
to
overthrow
a
government
that
silences
us
who
fight
in
the
name
of
the
disappeared
they
call
themselves
the
monicans
l
am
one
of
them
handler
aeon
we
have
an
assignment
we
want
you
to
sabotage
goodchilds
central
surveillance
facility
your
entry
will
be
noticed

but
we
will
briefly
disrupt
their
interior
alarms
surveillance
is
their
greatest
tool
against
us
as
long
as
monicans
can
be
seen

we
can
be
targeted
we
need
you
to
blind
them
each
mission
brings
us
closer
to
defeating
the
goodchild
regime

security
we
want

eliminate
him
you
shouldve
sent
me
in
earlier
that

taken
a
year
to
get
the
information
we
need
l
know
you
want
to
do
this
for
una
but
you
must
remember

this
is
larger
than
you
shes
not
the
only
innocent
person
whos
been
killed
this
is
our
moment
we
have
never
been
stronger
people

frightened

yes
but
if
we
show

they
will
rise
behind
us
when

ready
tomorrow

goodchild
will
be
preparing
his

you
will
need
to
cross
the
frontier
garden
once
you
are
through
the
garden

you
must
move
quickly
to
the
citadel
the
underground
interior

been
built
to

confusing
weve
implanted
a
route
for
you

lll
be
waiting

agree
with
the
policy
of
targeting
proven
monican
threats
but
lm
afraid
were
going
too
far
we
cant
go
too
far
with
them
there
are
advantages
to
showing
a
degree
of
leniency
we
cant
allow
them
the
luxury
of
hope

not
even
one
of
them
brute
force
isnt
the
only
option
lts
an
effective
one
the
monicans
are
growing
strong

soon

force
wont
be
enough
so
you
want
to
compromise
negotiate
the
policy
should
be
reconsidered
put
to
a
vote

the
policy
is
not
up
for
debate

encourage
you
to
look

those
among

tear
down
what
we
have
built
the
monicans

to
divide

cloning
had
never
been
used
on

successfully

we
succeeded
now

when

dies

their
dna
is
recycled
oren
and
l
built
the
relical
to
store
the
dna
and
conceal
the
cloning
process
the
keeper
finds
a
suitable
couple
and

using
food
additives

we
induce
a
chemical
pregnancy
when
the
woman
comes
in
for
an
exam

we
implant
a
cloned
embryo
from
there

the

of
shipwreck
you
heard
him
step
lively
you
know

for
all
that
pirates
are
clever
clogs

we
are
an
unimaginative
lot
when
it
comes
to
name
things
i
once
sailed
with
a
geezer

lost
both
of
his
arms

part
of
his
eye
whatd
you
call
him
larry
i
do
not
renegue
on
a
bargain
once
struck
but
we
agreed
on
ends
only

the
means
are
mine
to
decide
caution

barbosa
do
not
forget
it
was
by
my
power
you
returned
from
the
dead
or
what
it
means
if
you
fail
me
dont
you
forget
why
you
had
to
bring
me
back
why
not
leave
jack
to
his
welldeserved
fate
and
itll
take
no
less
than
nine
to
set
you
free
masters
pintel
and
ragetti
take
this
fishwife
to
the
brink
rot
this
way

mrs
fish
i
cannot
be
summoned
like
some
mongrel
pup
apparently
you
can
i
believe
you
know
each
other
come
to
join
my
crew
again

master
turner
jack
sparrow
sends
his
regards
sparrow
you
didnt
tell
him
we
rescued
jack
from
the
locker

along
with
the
black
pearl
what
else
have
you
not
told
me
there
is
an
issue
far
more
troublesome
i
believe
you
are
familiar
with
a
person
called
calypso
not
a
person
a
heathen
god
one
who
delights
in
cursing
men
with
their
wildest
dreams
and
them
revealing
them
to
be
hollow
and
naught
but
ash
the
world
is
well
rid
of
her
not
quite
so
well

actually
the
brethren
court
intends
to
release
her
no
they
cannot
the
first
court
promised
to
imprison
her
forever
that
was
our
agreement
your
agreement
ive
showed
them
how
to
bind
her
she
could
not
be
trusted
she
gave
me
no
choice
we
must
act
before
they
release
her
you
loved
her
shes
the
one
and
then
you
betrayed
her
she
pretended
to
love
me
she
betrayed
me
and
after
which
betrayal
did
you
cut
out
your
heart

i
wonder
do
not
test
me
i
aint
finished
that
you
will
free
my
father
and
you
will
guarantee
elizabeths
safety
along
with
my
own
your
terms
are
steep

mr
turner
we
will
expect
fair
value
in
return
there
is
only
one
price
i
will
accept
calypso

murdered
calypso
is
aboard
the
black
pearl
jack
has
sailed
the
black
pearl
to
shipwreck
cove
and
with
you
no
longer
aboard
her
how
do
you
propose
to
lead
us
now
what
is
it
you
want
most
theres
not
been
a
gathering
like
this
in
our
lifetime
neither
has
there
more
money
as
he
who
initialed
summons
i
convene
this

the
fourth
brethren
court
to
confirm
me
your
lordship
and
right
to
be
heard
present
now
your
pieces
of
eight

my
fellow
captains
those
arent
pieces
of
eight
theyre
just
pieces
of
junk
aye

the
original
plan
was
to
use
nine
pieces
of
eight
to
bind
calypso
but
when
the
first
court
met

the
brethren
were
for
once
skinned
broke
so
change
the
name
what

the
nine
pieces
of
whatever
we
happened
to
have
in
our
pockets
at
that
time
oh
yes

that
sounds
very
piratey
master
ragetti

if
you
will
ill
kept
it
safe
for
you

just
like
you
said
when
you
gave
it
to
me
i
have

but
now
i
need
it
back
might
i
point
out
that
we
are
still
short
one
pirate
lord
and
im
as
content
as
a
cucumber
to
wait
until
sao
feng
joins
us
sao
feng
is
dead
he
fell
to
the
flying
dutchman
the
plagued
ship
he
made
you
captain
just
giving
the
bloody
title
away
listen
to
me
our
location
has
been
betrayed
jones
is
under
the
command
of
lord
beckett

theyre
on
their
way
here
who
is
this
betrayer
not
likely
anyone
among
us
wheres
will
not
among
us
the
matter
is
not
how
they
found
us
the
question
is
what
will
we
do
now
that
they
have
we
fight
shipwreck
cove
is
a
fortress
a
well
supplied
fortress
there
is
no
need
to
fight
if
they
cannot
get
to
us
there
be
a
third
course
in
another
age

at
this
very
spot
the
first
brethren
court
captured
the
sea
goddess
and
bound
her
in
her
bones
that
was
a
mistake
oh

we
tamed
the
seas
for
ourselves

aye
but
opened
the
door
to
beckett
better
were
the
days
when
mastery
of
seas
came
not
from
bargains
struck
with
eldritch
creatures
but
from
the
sweat
of
a
mans
brow
you
all
know
this
to
be
true
gentlemen
ladies
we
must
free
calypso
shoot
him
cut
out
his
tongue
shoot
him
and
cut
out
his
tongue

then
shoot
his
tongue
trim
that
scraggly
beard
sao
feng
would
have
agreed
with
barbosa

aye
calypso
was
our
enemy
then
she
will
be
our
enemy
now
and
its
unlikely
her
moods
improved
i
would
still
agree
with
sao
feng
you
threaten
me
i
silence
you
this
is
madness
this
is
politics
meanwhile

our
enemies
are
bearing
down
upon
us
if
they
not
be
here
already
my
sweet
you
come
for
me
you
were
expecting
me
it
has
been
torture
trapped
in
this
single
form
cut
off
from
the
sea
from
all
that
i
love
ten
years
i
devoted
to
the
duty
you
charged
me
i
looked
after
those
who
died
at
sea
and
finally
when
we
could
be
together
again
you
werent
there
why
werent
you
there
is
my
nature
would
you
love
me
if
i
was
anything
but
what
i
am
i
do
not
love
you
many
things
you
were

davy
jones
but
never
cruel
you
have
corrupted
your
purpose
and
so
yourself
and
you
did
hide
away
what
should
always
have
been
mine
i
will
be
free
and
when
i
am

i
would
give
you
my
heart
and
we
would
be
together
always
if
one
day
you
had
a
heart
to
give
why
did
you
come
and
what
fate
have
you
planned
for
your
captors
the
brethren
court
all
of
them

the
last
thing
they
will
learn
in
this
life
is
how
cruel
i
can
be
and
what
have
you
feared
davy
jones
my
heart
will
always
belong
to
you
there
was
a
first
court
what
imprisoned
calypso
we
should
be
the
ones
to
set
her
free
and
in
her
gratitude
she
will
see
fit
to
grant
us
boons
whose
boons

your
boons
utterly
deceptive
twaddlespeak

says
i
if
you
have
a
better
alternative
please

share
cuttlefish
dear
friends
pen
them
up
together

and
they
will
devour
each
other
without
a
second
thought
human
nature

innit
or
or
fish
nature
so

yes

we
could
hole
up
here
wellprovisioned
and
wellarmed
and
half
of
us
would
be
dead
within
the
month
which
seems
quite
grim
to
me

any
way
you
slice
it
or
as
my
learned
colleague
so
na�vely
suggests
we
can
release
calypso
and
we
can
pray
that
she
will
be
merciful
i
rather
doubt
it
can
we
in
fact
pretend
that
she
is
anything
other
than
a
woman
scorned

like
which
fury
hell
hath
no
we
cannot
res
ipsa
loquitur
tabula
in
naufragio
we
are
left
with
but
one
option
ill
agree
withand
i
cannot
believe
the
words
captain
swann
we
must
fight
youve
always
run
away
from
a
fight
you
have
so
have
not
you
have
so
have
not
you
have
so

and
you
know
it
i
have
only
ever
embraced
that
oldest
and
noblest
of
pirate
traditions
i
submit
that
here
now
to
run
away
as
per
the
code
and
act
of
war

and
this
be
exactly
that
can
only
be
declared
by
the
pirate
king
you
made
that
up
did
i
now
i
call
on
captain
teague
keeper
of
the
code
sri
sumbhajee
proclaim
this
all
to
be
folly
hang
the
code
who
cares
if
the
code
is
the
law
youre
in
my
way

boy
the
code

the
code
as
set
forth
by
morgan
and
bartholomew
how
did
sea
turtles

mate
let
me
see
that
nay
ahh

barbosa
is
right
hang
on
a
minute
it
shall
be
the
duty
of
the
king
to
declare
war
there
has
not
been
a
king
since
the
first
court
and
thats
not
likely
to
change
not
likely
see

the
pirate
king
is
elected
by
popular
vote
and
each
pirate
only
ever
votes
for
hisself
i
call
for
a
vote
i
vote
for
ammand

the
corsar
capitaine
chevalle

the
penniless
frenchman
sri
sumbhajee
votes
for
sri
sumbhajee
mistress
ching
gentleman
jocard
villanueva
what
now

curious

isnt
it
am
i
to
understand
that
youd
rather
not
be
keeping
to
the
code
then
i
will
i
salute
captain
swann
king
of
the
brethren
court
prepare
every
vessel
that
floats
at
dawn
were
at
war
youve
seen
it
all

done
it
all
you
survived
thats
the
trick

innit
to
survive
its
not
just
about
living
forever

jacky
the
trick
is
living
with
yourself
forever
wheres
momma
the
enemy
is
here
lets
take
arms
youve
been
the
cur
that
let
these
wolves
to
our
door
if
you
wish
to
see
its
grand
architect

look
to
your
left
my
hands
are
clean
in
this
figuratively
my
actions
were
my
own

and
to
my
own
purpose
jack
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
well
spoke

listen
to
the
tool
will

i
have
been
aboard
the
dutchman
i
understand
the
burden
you
bear

but
i
feel
that
cause
is
lost
no
cause
is
lost
if
there
is
but
one
fool
left
to
fight
for
it
if
turner
wasnt
acting
on
your
behalf
then
how
did
he
come
to
give
me
this
you
made
a
deal
with
me

jack

to
deliver
the
pirates
dont
be
bashful

step
up

claim
your
award
your
debt
to
me
is
still
to
be
satisfied
one
hundred
years
on
servitude
aboard
the
dutchman
as
a
start
with
some
help
you
escaped
technically

i
propose
an
exchange
will
leaves
with
us
and
you
can
take
jack
done
undone
jacks
one
of
the
nine
pirate
lords

you
have
no
right
king
as
you
command

your
names
laggard
if
you
have
something
to
say

i
might
be
saying
something
as
well
first
to
the
finish
then
do
you
fear
death
youve
no
idea
advise
your
brethren
you
can
fight

and
all
of
you
will
die
or
you
can
not
fight

in
which
case
only
most
of
you
will
die
you
murdered
my
father
he
chose
his
own
fate
and
you
have
chosen
yours
we
will
fight

and
you
will
die
king
of
the
brethren
court
per
say
of
jack
maybe
he
really
does
know
what
hes
like
youve
successfully
arrived
aboard
the
flying
dutchman
as
per
the
overall
scheme
go
away
what

back
to
the
locker
not
without
you

jackie
stab
the
heart
live
forever
as
captain
of
the
flying
dutchman
then
again
if
youre
in
the
brig
you
should
stab
the
heart
it
does
seem
to
put
immortality
a
bit
out
of
reach
peanut
well
use
the
black
pearl
as
our
flagship
to
lead
the
attack
will
we
now
barbosa

you
cant
release
her
we
need
to
give
jack
a
chance
apologies

your
majesty
too
long
my
fate
has
not
been
in
my
own
hands
no
longer
the
enemy
has
opted
for
oblivion
ready
the
fleet
to
your
stations
be
there
some
manner
of
rite
or
incantation
the
items
brought
together
done
items
to
be
burned
and
someone
must
speak
the
words
calypso

i
release
you
from
your
human
bonds

that
it
they
said
it
must
be
spoken
as
if
to
a
lover

that
it
no

he
didnt
say
it

frightened
bilgerats
aboard
a
derelict
shipno

they
will
see
free

what
the
enemy
will
hear
is
the
flash
of
our
cannons
they
will
hear
the
ring
of
our
swords

and
they
will
know
what
we
can
do
by
the
sweat
of
our
brows
and
the
strength
of
our
backs
and
the
courage
of
our

true
if

loft
the
sails
and
lay
her
on
iron
belay
that
i

that
belay
that

captain
belay
the
endeavour
belay
belay
if

shut
it
what
are
they
waiting
for
he
expects

by
my
reckoning

i

have
a
debt
that

to
be
payed

on
the
wheel
then

mr
turner
aye

turner
this

a
purpose
again

where
we
are
bound
she
cannot
come
one
day

a
steep

on
the
one

someplace
where
you
feel
most
like
yourself
dear
ms

forster
i
got
your
note
and
im
afraid
there
must
be
some
kind
of
misunderstanding
as
far
as
i
know

the
lake
house
has
been
empty
for
several
years
maybe
your
note
was
intended
for
the
sandburg
house
down
the
shore
since
no
one
has
lived
in
this
house
for
years
but
im
curious
about
the
paw
prints
dear
mr

wyler

im
very
familiar
with
the
sandburg
cottage
and
i
can
guarantee
i
never
lived
there
im
oldfashioned

but
i
dont
think
a
cottage
should
be
over

square
feet
so
let
me
try
again
i
used
to
live
at
the
lake
house

then
i
moved
now
i
live
at

north
racine
in
chicago
id
appreciate
it
if
you
would
forward
my
mail
if
you
get
any
oh

by
the
way

its
has
been
all
year

ask
anyone
what
does
she
mean
good

mr

wyler

mr

wyler

overdramatic
man

love
that
place
i
cant
believe
that
things

running
you
look
like
shit
i
missed
you
too
hey

about
him

estates
youre
joking

i
dont
believe
this
i
come
back
after
four
years
and
i
get
this
in
front
of
me

what
my
brother
thinking
hes
frank
lloyd
whatever
oh

on

dad
keeps
you
hostage
in
that
little
mythmaking
factory
of
his
while
you
havent
built
so
much
as
a
phone
booth
or
a
hamster
cage
thats
funny

say
that

actually
i
have
a
hamster
cage
in
mind

a
development
of
them

prefab

no
foundations

play
this
game

at
the
lake
house
but
im
getting
tired
of
these
games

bye
thank
you

bye
maybe
we
should
introduce
ourselves
properly
im
a
doctor

dedicated
to
curing
the
sick
at
least

trying
to
im
an
architect

i
like
to
build
and
while
i
wouldnt
say
my
current
project
is
ideal
it
allows
me
to
be
here

in
this
place

and
thats
enough
for
now
but
tell
me
something

if
youre
working
in
a
hospital
in
chicago
now
where
were
you
before

in
my
time
two
years
ago

in
your
time
i
was
working
in
internal
medicine
in
madison
tell
me
about
the
future
whats
it
like
in
the
year
im
afraid
the
worlds
pretty
much
the
same
of
course

we
all
dress
in
shiny
metal
jump
suits
and
drive
flying
cars
and
no
one
talks
anymore
because
we
can
read
each
others
minds
but
the
truth
is

man
from
the
past
not
much
has
really
changed
in
speaking
of
the
past

though

ive
been
thinking
about
the
paw
prints
how
is
that
possible
well

i
think
we
have
the
same
dog
oh

yeah
whats
yours
like
according
to
the
vet

mine
is
eight
years
old
in
my
time
six
in
yours
shes
skinny

has
sad
eyes

snores

and
sleeps
like
a
person
i
dont

i
call
her
jack

was
nice
but
my
mom
didnt
marry
him

no
theres
always
something
better
coming
around
the
corner
thats
what
she
says
maybe
thats
what
that
lady
should
do

wait
for
something
better
to
come
around
the
corner

maybe
but
if
shes
not
careful

she
could
spend
her
whole
life
waiting

it
you
werent
born
yet

and
i
was
corbusier

frank
lloyd
wright
you

dad
played

with
both
of
them
sharing
a
joint

yeah

a
deck
here

youre
in
a
in
a
box
a
glass
box
with

containment

this
house
is
about
ownership

connection
i

its
beautiful

seductive

its
incomplete
it
was
all
about
him

how
to
build
a
house

not
a
home
but
you
know
i
think
he
wants
us
to
do
what
he
couldnt
but
admitting
that
would
mean
admitting
that
he
came
up
short
in
some
way
that
he
could
do
more
and
that
tortures
him
do
you
remember

him

years
later

they
they
meet
again
they
get
another
chance
you
know

but
they
dont
know
if
too
much
time
has
passed
if
they
waited
too
long

if
its
you

too
late
to
make
it

im
here
if

anything
coffee
theres
something
i
never
told
you

kate
you
see

it
was
my
father
who
built
the
lake
house
i
mean

with
his
own
hands
and
it
was
a
long
time
ago

before
he
was
famous
when
he
still
had
a
family
and
worshipped
my
mother
her
name
was
mary

and
the
house
was
a
gift
for
her
she
was
smart
and
funny
she
could
have
done
anything

but
chose
to
take
care
of
my
brother
and
i
and
help
him
build
his
career
you
see

the
more
successful
he
became

the
more
impossible
he
was
to
live
with
finally

she
just
couldnt
take
living
with
him
anymore
she
left
him
within
a
year

she
got
sick
unfortunately

she
never
learned
how
to
stop
loving
him
he
wasnt
at
the
funeral
when
i
asked
him
why
go
on

alex

what
did
he
say
he
said

she
was
dead
to
me
the
moment
she
stepped
out
of
the
house
and
then
he
gave
me
one
of
his
architectoftheyear
grins
i
hope
you
appreciate
this
i
had
to
sneak
past
three
nurses
and
your
attending
oh

jeez

its
hot
its
not
decaf

is
it
it
should
be

but
it
isnt
thats
not
bad

thank
you
youre
welcome

wheres
your
brother
i
sent
him
away

he
wasnt
feeling
well
you
know
how
he
is

he
worries

yeah

i
know
he
gets
that
from
your
mother

im
afraid
she
always
worried
too
much
what
are
you
looking
at
oh

yeah

here

take
a
gander
its
a
proposal
for
a
museum
who
is
it
someone
new
oh

i
like
the
walkways

where
the
light
falls
what
are
the
materials
granite

aluminum
white
panels
are
straight
out
of
meier
but
the
interior
color
coming
through
the
front
windows

thats
different
its
not
new

but
its
clean

uncluttered
i
like
it
when
was
the
last
time
you
were
in
barcelona
years
ago

with
you

mom
and
henry
do
you
remember
visiting
casa
de
la
caritat
the
almshouse
thats
right

you
mentioned
meier
his
barcelona
museum
stands
in
the
same
area
as
casa
de
la
caritat
it
drinks
the
same
light
meier
designed
a
series
of
louvered
skylights
to
capture
that
light
and
cast
it
inward
to
illuminate
the
art
within

but
indirectly
and
that
was
important

because
although
light
enhances
art
it
can
also
degrade
it

but
you
know
all
that
already

you
son
of
a
gun
now

this
where
do
you
suppose
this
is
to
be
built
i
have
no
idea
oh

but
you
said
you
liked
it

conceptually
now

come
on
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
the
light
in
barcelona
is
quite
different
from
the
light
in
tokyo
and
the
light
in
tokyo
is
different
from
that
in
prague
a
truly
great
structure

one
that
is
meant
to
stand
the
tests
of
time
never
disregards
its
environment
an
architect
takes
that
into
account
he
knows
that
if
he
wants
presence

he
must
consult
with
nature
he
must
be
captivated
by
the
light
always
the
light

always
hey

i
have
an
emergency

take
my
shift

please
mr

wyler
yes
this
is
dr

klyczynski
at
chicago
city
hospital
im
afraid
i
have
some
difficult
news
for
you
im
so
sorry

alex
i
wish
somehow
i
could
be
there
with
you
that
we
could
sit
together
and
look
out
over
the
water
and
the
light
in
this
house
your
father
built
i
could
be
a
shoulder
for
you
like
youve
been
for
me
and
tell
you
that
everything
is
gonna
be
okay
if
i
could
do
one
thing
for
you
today
from

one
small

simple
thing
from
the
future

sherban
carnival
a
dhamphir

a
young
woman
where
is
the
girl
there
is
no
girl
well
find
her

no
then
she
is
alive

the
little
one
who
slipped
through
my
fingers
you
must
find
her

she
poses
a
threat
to
my
plans
send
out
your
best
spies

domastir
master
kagan
lay
still
get
away
kagan
is
building
an
army
of
thralls

and
were
on
our
way
to
a
carnival
am
i
the
only
one
who
thinks
this
is
madness
katarin
then
how
do
you
suggest
we
deal
with
this
army

sebastian
brimstone
is
a
shadow
of
its
former
self
i
have
yet
to
see
the
point
in
finding
this
carnival
listen

you
two

when
has
a
vampire
ever
been
held
in
captivity
let
alone
by
a
circus
troupe
she
may
be
the
one

youre
focusing
your
energies
on
kagan
this
is
what
ive
decided
to
do
havent
we
wasted
enough
time
with
fairy
tales
this
is
the
work
of
a
young
vampire
out
of
control
blood
rage

or

perhaps

a
young
dhamphir
we
have
work
to
do
sit
still
did
you
see
who
it
was
that
bit
you
rayne

take
my
sword
i
didnt
see
anything

i
dont
even
remember
what
happened
you
were
bitten
by
a
vampire

and
you
dont
remember
anything
that
happened
we
should
kill
her
now

please
she
didnt
mean
to
bite
me

shes
not
a
vampire
she
was
wearing
a
crucifix
i
gave
her
when
it
happened
she
is
my
friend
we
have
more
work
to
do
we
passed
a
small
village
not
too
far
back
i
will
see
if
i
can
find
her
hiding
there

with
your
permission
if
shes
what
i
think
she
is

were
likely
not
the
only
ones
looking
for
her
you
requested
me

viscount
i
have
a
message
for
my
daughter
dearest
katarin
all
right

katarin
although
weve
had
our
differences
in
the
past
i
beseech
you
now
to
put
away
all
grudges
for
the
good
of
humanity
it
pains
me
to
admit
that
our
beloved
but
weakened
brimstone
society
can
no
longer
defeat
kagan
yet
he
must
not
be
allowed
to
acquire
beliars
artifacts
nor
legacy
thus
i
turn
to
you

my
daughter
to
help
me
protect
the
souls
of
this
land
you
and
i
are
the
only
ones
who
know
what
is
hidden
in
brimstone
fortress
its
value

its
importance
i
need
you
to
bring
this
artifact
to
me
it
must
be
protected
from
those
who
wish
to
use
it
to
undermine
me
scratch
that
to
undermine
freedom
and
humanity
and
together
we
will
stop
this
madness
and
bring
peace
to
these
lands
your
beloved
father

et
cetera

et
cetera
a
very
compelling
argument

master
youre
such
a
suckup
find
your
own
meal
keep
away
from
us
i
will
not
harm
you

i
only
wish
to
kill
vampires
im
sorry
about
your
friend

he
was
my
brother
im
sorry
that
we
had
to
leave
him
there
why
did
you
save
us
i
dont
know
where
is
your
family
i
dont
have
a
family
dhamphir

dhamphir
got
it

come
on
i
see
a
journey
in
your
future
a
journey

perhaps

to
within
dhamphir

you
dont
know

do
you
i
will
stand

i
was
expecting
you
theres
a
reason
youre
here

what
did
you
call
me
most
believe
that
your
kind
are
merely
legends
it
is
rare
to
see
a
live
dhamphir
part
vampire

part
human
mostly
they
die
at
birth

generally
they
are
exterminated
youve
hidden
well
my
tales
hold
some
truth

i
see
there
was
a
man

a
man
kagan
kagans
not
a
man

hes
a
vampire

and
you
are
his
creation
he
killed
my
mother
dhamphirs
are
rarely
a
product
of
a
happy
union
between
a
vampire
and
a
human
your
poor
mother
i
will
kill
him
listen
to
me

dhamphir
and
this
is
not
easy
to
tell
you
and
will
likely
result
in
great
danger
for
all
involved
kagan
has
become
the
most
powerful
vampire
taking
advantage
of
a
land
with
no
law
i
do
not
care

how
do
i
find
him
you
are
naive

tell
me
he
resides
in
a
guarded
castle
beyond
the
dark
mountains
but
there
are
no
safe
entrances
there
is
an
ancient
talisman
an
eye
that
kagan
seeks
if
you
possess
it

you
will
certainly
get
an
audience
why
do
you
tell
me
this
because
its
my
purpose
and
the
prophecy
they
say
this
talisman
of
the
eye
is
kept
in
the
solambria
monastery
to
the
south
be
careful

my
child

the
eye
is
far
more
than
a
mere
trinket
the
talisman
holds
great
power
but
its
important
that
you
move
quickly
you
will
be
doing
the
entire
world
a
great
service
keeping
this
from
kagan
im
not
interested
in
the
world

only
in
kagan
the
fortuneteller
had
a
visitor

this
dhamphir
is
now
in
search
of
the
eye
good

she
can
lead
us
to
it
i
highly
doubt
that
her
intent
is
to
deliver
it
to
her
longlost
father
kill
her

let
her
find
the
eye
or
let
her
try

then
kill
her
a
dhamphir
should
be
no
match
for
you
your
suspicion
was
correct

domastirs
on
the
move
what
is
it

my
child
i
have
been
separated
from
my
family
and
have
been
traveling
for
three
days
and
nights
without
food
or
sleep
may
i
seek
solace
in
your
monastery
for
a
nights
rest
please
come
in

my
child

welcome
to
the
solambria
monastery
enjoy
your
food

and
then
you
may
rest
i
suggest
you
follow
me
youre
not
one
of
kagans

are
you
no

i
mean
you
no
harm
but
i
must
leave
now
im
sorry

you
cannot
leave
it
seems
that
you
absorbed
the
eye
our
order
has
been
guarding
it
for
centuries
why
do
you
protect
it
because
the
eye
holds
powers
why
do
you
think
water
no
longer
burns
you
there
are
three
talismans
an
eye

a
rib
and
a
heart
they
all
belonged
to
a
longdead
vampire
named
beliar
he
discovered
a
method
to
defy
those
elements
that
destroy
vampires
water

sunlight
and
a
cross
when
he
was
finally
defeated
his
body
was
quickly
dismembered
and
parts
of
it
were
hidden
all
over
the
lands
out
of
the
reach
of
vampires
if
they
become
united
again
they
could
make
a
vampire
powerful
enough
to
control
the
world
beliars
not
my
concern
my
mission
is
my
own
and
not
of
evil
intent
you
are
a
vampire
yet
you
are
immune
to
the
cross
i
am
a
dhamphir
so
kagans
own
offspring
is
his
enemy
how
is
it
you
know
about
me
there
has
been
talk
for
years
that
kagan
was
in
search
of
a
prodigious
child
his
bloodline
is
strong
enough
to
produce
one
he
is
our
biggest
threat
he
has
an
army
of
thralls
humans
who
choose
to
work
for
him
rather
than
die
and
they
can
do
things
vampires
cannot
now
you
understand
why
i
cannot
let
you
leave
with
the
eye
father
father
the
monasterys
being
attacked
dont
let
kagan
get
the
eye
wheres
the
eye
kill
her
hurry
lets
go
hes
taking
her
to
kagans

you
must
go
back
to
brimstone
put
them
on
full
alert
that
the
monastery
has
been
attacked
and
the
eye
is
gone
brimstone
come
closer
dont
be
afraid
leonids
lair

why
would
domastir
bring
her
here
perhaps
she
needs
to
feed

or
the
sun
now
that
she
has
the
eye

we
must
capture
her
bring
her
back
to
brimstone
before
its
too
late
domastir

domastir

why
do
you
come
here
and
insult
my
palace
with
your
stench
i
need
shelter
till
nightfall
is
that
a
gift
youve
laid
at
my
feet

domastir
how
delightful
no

leonid

she
is
kagans
kagan

the
mightiest
of
all
vampires
funny

domastir
i
do
not
see
him
shell
make
a
fine
addition
to
my
collection
touch
her
and
your
fingers
are
gone
such
a
dedicated
peon
fine

take
her

then
i
have
more
than
enough
to
satisfy
my
needs
but
none
with
an
eye
like
that
she
stays
remove
him
cut
it
where
did
you
acquire
such
a
gem
give
it
to
me
and
i
will
let
you
live
give
it
to
me
you
have
the
eye
you
give
it
to
me
give
it
to
me

or
ill
rip
it
out
of
your
face
so

we
meet
again
vladimir

ive
always
admired
your
spirit

its
a
shame
you
must
die
you
fool

vladimir
lets
get
her
out
how
can
you
be
certain
shell
be
useful
to
us
she
has
already
been
useful

she
stopped
kagan
from
getting
the
eye
yes

vladimir

but
listen
ive
been
hunting
vampires
since
before
you
were
born
and
there
was
always
one
that
i
suspected

or
hoped

existed
we
have
to
consider
what
she
is

vladimir
if
she
was
simply
a
vampire

crossing
the
water
would
kill
her
and
theres
also
that
which
most
vampires
are
not
fond
of
having
where
are
you
taking
me
you
should
be
grateful
youre
still
alive
we
helped
each
other

i
do
not
need
you
anymore
i
should
skin
you
and
hang
you
on
display
wheres
the
eye
it
has
somehow
become
a
part
of
her
it
has
assimilated
she
must
be
brought
to
me
alive
leave
me

ill
send
further
instructions
does
she
have
a
name

the
dhamphir
i
have
heard
she
is
called
rayne
rayne
what
is
this
place
welcome
to
the
headquarters
of
the
brimstone
society
all
in
good
reason

i
hope
there
was
a
messenger
killed
in
the
monastery
master

the
talisman
has
arrived
this
dhamphirs
inconsequential
its
kagan
you
should
be
interested
in
there
was
a
brimstone
in
rome
it
has
been
completely
annihilated
and
thats
not
all
kagan
has
the
rib
what
would
make
us
think
that
you
wont
attack
i
told
you
i
do
not
thirst
for
human
blood
if
you
have
live
animals
here
rats

even
i
will
regain
my
strength
quickly
and
be
on
my
way
i
dont
trust
her
i
want
what
you
want
to
bring
kagan
to
ruin
i
speak
the
truth

he
raped
my
mother
and
murdered
her
in
front
of
my
own
eyes
where
is
the
girl
there
is
no
girl
i
will
find
her
sometimes
we
must
have
faith
in
others
i
believe
you
know
that
its
useless
to
fight
kagan
alone
if
you
wish

youre
welcome
to
stay
here
and
train
with
us
may
i
have
my
swords
all
in
good
time
give
her
what
she
needs
yes

katarin
what
lies
ahead
will
you
be
opening
up
the
gates
to
the
thralls
thats
ridiculous
i
am
loyal
to
you

vladimir
yet
youre
breaking
the
very
laws
and
teachings
you
swore
by
your
new
found
faith
scares
me
what
will
happen
to
brimstone
in
the
event
of
battle
i
dont
have
all
the
answers
were
growing
weak
control
physical
strength
without
control
means
nothing
once
again

from
the
beginning
they
belonged
to
a
friend
i
know
someone
that
might
be
able
to
help
our
seamstress
has
prepared
some
clothing
i
hope
theyre
to
your
liking
ever
since
i
got
here

there
are
these
noises
that
persist
in
my
head
im
sure
theres
some
reason
for
that
if
youre
feeling
up
to
it
youre
more
than
welcome
to
join
us
for
dinner
i
dont
think
the
food
you
have
there
will
be
of
interest
to
me
you
act
as
though
youre
the
only
one
who
feels
pain
what
do
you
know
of
pain
my
fathers
kagan
my
mother
was
killed
before
my
own
eyes
my
mother
and
father
were
both
killed
by
vladimir
they
had
turned

and
i
was
to
be
slaughtered
had
he
not
arrived

i
would
not
be
here
today
your
food
what

are
we
sitting
at
the
table
of
the
children
were
running
out
of
food
we
have
to
go
to
the
mainland
and
get
supplies
no

its
not
a
good
idea
well
have
to
make
do
with
what
we
have

we
have
to
eat
perhaps
your
savior
can
multiply
our
supplies
welcome

wont
you
come
sit
with
us
it
seems
youve
become
very
popular
i
think
youve
breathed
some
new
hope
into
the
society
this
surprises
you
i
thought
they
would
be
afraid
of
me
they
only
fear
what
they
do
not
know
can
i
see
your
teeth
darius
so
youre
satisfied
with
your
new
clothing
yes

thank
you
in
the
days
since
i
received
your
letter
i
have
come
to
see
certain
truths
that
now
give
me
pause
i
believe
that
you
are
right
brimstone
is
lost
be
sure
this
message
arrives
it
is
of
grave
importance

yes

katarin
the
spoils
of
rome
only
one
brimstone
remains
bring
me
my
thralls
the
time
has
come
to
fulfill
your
oaths

my
loyal
thralls
scour
the
land

find
brimstone
and
destroy
it
bring
the
dhamphir
to
me

leave
no
human
alive
that
crosses
you
the
promise
of
eternal
life
awaits
those
who
succeed
those
who
fail
will
find
only
death
nice
form

finally
we
agree
on
something
vladimir
needs
you

hes
in
the
courtyard
good
match
until
we
duel
again
you
duel
a
little
your
form
is
weak

youre
lacking
passion
its
part
of
my
plan

i
am
tiring
you
out
your
plan
is
lacking
passion
as
well
i
see
they
have
taught
you
well
hardly

i
was
trained
in
battle
by
a
great
warrior
one
whom
has
long
disappeared
fighting
alongside
brimstone
where
is
this
warrior
now
he
is
now
a
cursed
enemy
a
vampire

my
loyalties
lie
with
vladimir
and
the
brimstone
my
father
protected
as
a
human
and
what
do
your
loyalties
consist
of
youre
a
curious
one

my
purpose
is
to
fulfill
my
fathers
will
killing
the
very
thing
hes
become
it
seems
all
this
chatter
has
veered
me
from
the
task
at
hand
you
should
pay
more
attention
keep
your
friends
close

enemies
even
closer
vladimir
taught
me
that
we
shall
continue
this
later
good
evening

viscount

kagan
sends
his
regards
i
assume
you
were
expecting
this
message
from
brimstone
from
katarin
would
you
stop
throwing
things
at
me
you
know

elrick

kagan
has
little
patience
for
ambitious
vampires
especially
those
that
were
once
brimstone
can
a
vampire
not
receive
word
from
his
own
daughter
without
being
cast
as
a
rebel
in
search
of
power
is
that
the
plan
plans
are
for
humans
i
think
destiny
is
a
more
appropriate
term
where
is
brimstone
tell
me
now

or
suffer
the
consequences
even
you
must
sense
that
change
is
upon
us
this
land
has
become
unsettled
the
future
must
be
held
in
the
hands
of
humanborn
and
vampireperfected
that
is
an
invitation

by
the
way
spare
katarin

unseat
kagan
and
join
me
in
a

shall
we
say

more
colorful
reign
kagans
gratitude
or
kagans
wrath
now

wheres
brimstone
you
honestly
expect
me
to
betray
my
daughter
you
know

its
funny
you
never
struck
me
as
the
paternal
type
now

get
me
the
map
give
us
our
destiny
we
leave
now

and
that
will
be
the
end
of
it
you
should
travel
with
sebastian

there
something
you
want
to
speak
about
you
should
not
travel
with
her

a
danger
to
you

surely
out
looking
for
her
youre
an
important
part
of
the
brimstone
society
your
work
defending
the
fortress
is
essential
to
our
struggle
and
survival

and
the
thralls
are
there
any
survivors
you
cant
go
back

theres
too
many
they
came
looking
for
you

how
did
they
find
us
i
have
dressings
for
his
wounds
this
doesnt
feel
right
how
would
they
know
this
is
what
kagan
wants
to
lure
back
whats
left
of
brimstone
to
him
so
he
can
destroy
us
once
and
for
all
domastir
will
pay
with
his
life
for
this
if
they
want
a
fight

a
fight
they
will
get
it
was
katarin
you
must
choose

bargain
for
freedom
or
leave
your
children
motherless
as
a
brimstone
martyr
shes
turned
just
let
me
go

i
cant
you
will

where
are
you
going
im
going
on
my
own
everyone
who
comes
near
me
dies
they
came
looking
for
me
and
the
eye
none
of
those
people
had
to
die

you
too
will
be
dead
if
i
stay
with
you
you
dont
have
to
do
this

im
going
to
find
the
heart
with
two
of
the
talismans

i
will
stand
a
chance
against
kagan
how
do
you
expect
to
find
the
heart
i
can
hear
it
goodbye

sebastian
just
wait

wait

stop

here
you
can
wear
this
with
pride
and
here
this
will
protect
you
sir

weve
searched
the
entire
grounds

theres
no
sign
of
the
dhamphir
she
is
not
amongst
the
dead
either

sir
perhaps
she
was
never
here
we
must
return
to
kagan

she
could
be
on
her
way
there
now
prepare
the
boats
yes

sir
the
heart
perhaps
theres
some
truth
to
this
prophecy
after
all
even
if
she
has
the
heart

she
cant
face
kagan
alone
nothing
yet
are
you
certain
that
its
down
there
are
you
questioning
me
my
grandfather
placed
it
there
i
would
not
risk
all
on
folktales
why
did
we
let
the
others
die
it
was
them
or
all
of
us
we
sacrifice
animals
to
survive

brimstone
is
no
different
i
will
kneel
before
no
one
nor
will
i
sit
here
under
vladimirs
command
and
await
death
i
will
not
allow
kagan
to
take
away
our
freedom
the
heart
will
go
to
my
father
and
if
you
want
to
live

you
will
secure
the
entrance
until
i
return
shes
not
coming

its
too
late
have
faith

sebastian

she
will
be
here
i
am
here
for
kagan
what
is
she
doing
i
have
brought
the
heart
for
my
father
give
it
to
me

come
on
you
have
what
you
want

now
take
me
to
kagan
all
in
good
time

take
her
well

sebastian
im
afraid
theres
only
one
way
in
master
the
dhamphir
has
come
to
her
senses
and
delivered
the
heart
shall
i
bring
her
in
no

not
yet
an
historic
night
prepare
to
witness
the
beginning
of
a
new
era
clear
the
room
clear
the
room
thralls
forward
march
capture
them
alive

take
them
to
the
dungeon
to
the
dungeon
there
may
be
more

them
in
the
cell
for
now
and
scour
the
castle
the
rats

be
eating
well
tonight
enjoy
your
stay
and
you

my
dear

you
will
stay
here
until
the
ceremony
i
know
nothing
of
a
ceremony

the
eye

dhamphir
the
ceremony
to
extract
the
eye
are
you
all
right
yes
it
is
good
to
know
that
you
are
both
alive
i
fear
were
the
only
ones

what
of
katarin
is
she
still
alive
if
not

then
she
died
with
honor
fighting
for
her
people
what
do
you
know
of
this
ceremony
its
an
ancient
vampire
ritual
created
to
protect
the
talismans
in
case
they
fall
into
the
wrong
hands
what
will
come
of
me
it
is
only
a
legend
said
to
remove
the
soul
i
do
not
know
what
is
going
to
happen
to
me
now
i
hope
that
you
know
that
i
am
not
foolish
enough
to
think
that
im
going
to
prevail
against
him
but
i
do
not
intend
to
stop
fighting
for
a
second
nor
will
we
open
up
and
bind
her
hands
it
is
time
for
the
ceremony
weve
got
to
find
a
way
out
of
here

well

lets
get
out
then
even
in
absolute
defeat

youre
still
not
humble
if
im
defeated
and
youre
so
powerful
then
why
must
i
be
shackled
when
surrounded
by
your
thralls
youre
still
a
risk

i
should
thank
you
now
that
brimstone
is
eradicated
and
you
have
so
kindly
handed
me
the
heart
i
would
never
have
believed
it
would
have
been
so
easy
if
you
live
through
this

which
is
unlikely
you
may
remain
here
in
my
castle
i
would
sooner
rot
in
your
dungeon
than
sit
at
your
table
so
be
it
let
us
begin
thrall

my
companion
is
gone
i
dont
know
whats
become
of
him
stand
back
cant
believe
that
worked
savage
please
continue
this
is
the
end
of
brimstone
you
have
the
heart

give
it
to
me
you
will
have
to
cut
it
from
me
youre
strong

rayne

but
not
skilled
enough
give
me
the
heart

and
i
shall
spare
your
life
i
would
choose
death
over
seeing
you
as
my
ruler
youre
interfering
with
fate

with
the
talismans
joined
vampires
shall
rule
the
earth
as
if
your
interests
are
noble
for
centuries

weve
been
cursed
to
the
shadows

slaughtered
by
the
fearful
have
you
not
always
longed
for
freedom
you
condemned
me
the
day
you
raped
my
mother
i
will
see
she
has
vengeance
ungrateful
bitch
choose
to
be
human
and
die
like
one
the
talismans

i
dont
care

kagan
is
dead
please

please
please

you
dont
have
to
leave
me
its
my
time
send
him
back
will
you
commit
to
this
program
i
cant
theres
no
place
it
wont
catch
up
to
you
its
how
every
story
ends
its
what
you
are

jason

a
killer
you
always
will
be
go
ahead

go
on

go
on
do
it
do
it
she
wouldnt
want
me
to

thats
the
only
reason
youre
alive
who
is
she
she
was
killed
in
india
the
director
of
operations
ward
abbott
arranged
it
so
we
have
a
dirty
section
chief
who
kills
bournes
girl
bourne
comes
back
for
revenge

tapes
abbotts
confession

and
abbott
commits
suicide
now
bournes
gunnin
for
us

you
couldnt
make
this
stuff
up
bournes
last
confirmed
location
was
moscow

six
weeks
ago
right

hes
on
the
run

hes
dangerous
now

sir

with
respect

i
think

something
else
could
be
going
on
here
what
whats
he
after
the
reason
that
bourne
went
to
moscow
was
to
see
the
daughter
of
his
first
target
whats
your
point
pam
maybe
he
was
retracing
his
steps
just
looking
for
something
something
in
his
past
maybe
he
hasnt
found
it
yet

we
need
to
know

what
it
is
youre
telling
me

hes
not
a
threat
to
this
agency
i
think
if
he
wanted
to
hurt
us
he
could
have
sent
the
tape
to
cnn
maybe
he
still
will
my
number
one
rule
is
hope
for
the
best

plan
for
the
worst
as
far
as
im
concerned

bournes
still
a
serious
threat

until
proven
otherwise
lets

make
it
bourne

just
stay
where
you
are
i
dont
think
we
should
wait
i
think
somebody
is
coming
i
am
going
for
it

no

not
we
have
a
situation
yes
director
kramer
would
like
to
see
you
you
need
to
get
those
warrants
he
said
its
urgent
a
well
known
journalist
based
here
in
london

with
guardian
newspaper
it
appears
that
her
was
gunned
down
right
in
the
middle
of
waterloo
station

of
course
around
the

this
afternoon
in
full
view
of
hundreds
of
commuters
good
morning

can
i
take
your
order
yes

ill
have
the
heart
healthy
omelet
with
goats
cheese
and
peppers

please
anything
for
you

maam
only
coffee

please
sure
im
buying

im
good
so

when
the
director
called
and
it
was
suggested
that
we
bring
you
suggested
are
you
sure
it
was
just
a
suggestion
its
funny
how
different
things
look

depending
on
where
you
sit

right
i
look
at
this
as
a
favour
for
you

pam
i
am
giving
you
an
opportunity
to
complete
some
unfinished
business
meaning
bourne
hes
here

hes
a
threat

and
we
both
want
the
same
thing
and
we
both
go
about
it
in
two
very
different
ways

past
is
passed

pam
you
were
careless
in
stockholm

so
what
was
waterloo
just
careless
again
we
had
a
leak

a
serious
national
security
situation
bourne
showed
up
on
our
surveillance
and
we
had
very
little
time
to
react
and
a
reporter
got
killed
bourne
saw
us
coming

the
question
it
is
what
was
he
doing
there
no

the
real
question
is
how
you
managed
to
get
into
a
firefight
at
a
public
train
station
you
know

as
well
as
i
do

decisions
made
in
realtime
are
never
perfect
dont
second
guess
an
operation
from
an
armchair
ill
see
you
at
the
office

enjoy
your
egg
whites
people
pamela
landy
and
her
associate

tom
cronin
shes
going
to
be
quarterbacking
the
search
effort

say
your
name
and
state
your
specs
please
well
lets
do
names
later

ok
whats
bournes
last
fixed
postion
london


noon
status
what
is
he

armed

wounded
alive

mobile
and
unknown
do
you
have
an
echelon
package
yes
why
isnt
it
on
we
were
waiting

waiting
for
what
listen

people

do
you
have
any
idea
who
you
are
dealing
with
you
are

hours
behind
the
toughest
target
have
ever
tracked
i
want
everyone
to
sit
down

strap
in
and
turn
on
all
youve
got
that
would
mean
now
thank
you
give
me
a
team
deployment
plan
i
want
everything
youve
got
on
ross
on
screen
sir

i
think
we
have
something
we
just
hacked
rosss
email
account
at
the
guardian
we
found
a
roundtrip
ticket
to
turin

italy

yesterday

arrival


departure
i
think
can
be
pretty
certain
that
bourne
is
not
your
source

then
rosss
call
to
his
editor

where
he
said
hed
just
met
the
source
took
place
just
after
his
turin
flight
landed
he
met
his
source
in
turin
so
so
what
bourne
met
ross
in
turin
for
the
breakfast
then

the
same
day

bourne
calls
ross
to
demand
him
meet
at
waterloo
maybe
they
were
even
on
the
same
flight
crosscheck
the
secure
cellphone
usage
of
everyone
with
sci
clearance
yes

all
calls
going
in
and
out
of
turin

italy

the
morning
that
ross
was
there
the
guy
youre
after
is
a
cia
operative

with
clearance
above
top
secret
hes
committing
treason
by
talking
to
ross
do
you
really
think
while
doing
that
hes
going
to
use
a
cellphone
that
he
knows
we
can
track
zero
results
on
the
cross
check

so
you
got
any
better
ideas
yeah

look
at
all
the
people
whose
cellphones
were
switched
off
the
entire
period
ross
was
in
turin
three
names
tom
brewster

jack
boulin
and
neal
daniels
now
check
everything
in
rosss
apartment
against
those
names
check
for
common
patterns

anything
that
indicates
who
ross
met
pull
it
up

is
that
documents
over
here

whos
that
right
there

initials
hold
that

bring
that
up
on
main
neil

daniels

it
i
am
worried

same
as

true
that
you
fainted
i
mean

actually
fainted
shove
off
malfoy
our
teacher
of
care
of
magic
creatures
of
so
many
years
he
has
decided
to
retire
in
order
to
spend
more
time
with
his
remaining
limbs
fortunately

i
am
delighted
to
announce
that
his
place
will
be
taken
by
none
other
that
our
own
rubeus
hagrid
finally
a
note
of
warning
at
the
request
of
the
minister
of
magic
hogwarts
will
until
further
notice
play
host
to
dementores
of
azkaban
until
such
a
time
sirius
black
is
captured
the
dementores
will
stationed
at
every
entrance
to
the
ground
while
ourside
have
been
assured
a
word
of
caution
the
dementores
are
vicious
creatures
they
do
not
distinguish
between
the
ones
they
hunt
and
the
ones
who
get
in
their
way
therefore

i
must
warn
each
and
everyone
of
you
give
them
no
reason
to
harm
you
it
is
not
in
the
nature
of
a
dementor
to
be
forgiving
but

you
know
happiness
can
be
found
even
in
the
darkest
of
time
only
they
must
remember
to
turn
on
the
light
fortuna

much
for

part
you
see

the
enchantment

is
not

what
really
finishes
a
boggert
is
laughter
you
need

assume
a
shape
you

truly
amusing
i

explain

neville

long
as

see
it

we
will
see
it
when

open
that
wardrobe
here

what

back
to
the
class
thats
the
end
of
the
lesson
thank
you
sorry

sorryperhaps
too
much
of
a
good
thing
now
remember
these
visits
to
hogsmeade
village
are
a
privilege
should
your
behaviour
reflect
poorly
on
school
in
any
way
that
privilege
shall
not
be
extended
again
no
permission
forms
signed
no
visiting
the
village
thats
the
rule
potter
all
those
who
permissions
follow
me

those
without

stay
put
but
professor
i
thought
that
if
you
would
sign
it
then
i
could
go
i
cant

only
a
parrent
or
a
guardian
can
sign
since
i
am
neither

it
would
be
inappropriate
i
am
sorry
potter
thats
my
final
word
forget
about
it
guys

see
you
later
professor

can
i
ask
you
something
you
want
to
know
why
i
stopped
you
facing
that
bogart

yes
i
thought
that
it
would
be
obvious
that
it
would
take
the
form
of
lord
voldemort
i
did
think
of
voldemort

at
first
but
the
i
remembered
that
night
on
the
train
with
the
dementor
i
am
very
impressed
it
suggest
that
what
you
fear
the
most
is
fear
itself
this
is
very
wise
before
i
fainted
i
heard
something
a
woman
screaming
the
dementors
force
is
to
relive
our
very
worst
memories
our
pain
becomes
their
power
i
think
it
was
my
mother
the
night
she
was
murdered
you
knows

that
the
very
first
time
i
saw
you
harry
i
recognized
you
imidiately
not
by
your
scar

by
your
eyes
they
are
your
mother

lilys
yes
oh
yes

i
knew
her
your
mother
was
there
for
me
at
a
time

when
no
one
else
was
no
only
was
she
a
singularly
gifted
witch
she
was
also
an
uncommonly
kind
woman
and
a
way
of
seeing
the
beauty
in
others
most
especially
when
that
person
could
not
see
it
himself
and
your
father
james

on
the
other
hand
he
had
a
certain
talent
for
trouble
talent
talent
the
rumor
has
it

he
passed
on
to
you
you
are
more
like
them
then
you
know
with
time
you
will
come
to
see
just
how
much
but
nothing
beat
the
jug
shop
you
have
to
go
to
the
chance
to
see
castle
too
you
know
its
the
nicest
building
in
britain
probably
neville
has
forgotten
the
password
again
let
me
through

please

excuse
me

i
am
headboy
get
back
all
of
you

no
one
is
to
enter
this
dormentry
until
it
has
been
fully
searched
the
fat
lady

she
is
gone
serves
her
right

she
was
a
terrible
singer
its
not
funny

ron
keep
calm
everone

back
to
the
corridor
be
quite

the
head
master
is
here
have
you
heard
now
move
mister
filch

roundup
the
ghosts
search
every
painting
of
the
castle
and
find
the
fat
lady
there
are
no
need
for
ghosts
professor
the
fat
lady
is
there
leave
me

that
i
am
going
to
raise
listen
to
me

i
am
a
prefect
walk
dear
lady

who
did
this
to
you
i
saw
the
devil
himself
and
i
cannot
say
his
name
it
him
of
course
the
one
they
all
talk
about
he
is
here

somewhere
in
the
castle
sirius
black
secure
the
castle

mister
fudge
the
rest
of
you

to
the
great
hall
i
have
searched
in
the
stormy
tower
and
the
south
wing
but
there
was
nothing
there
thank
you
the
rd
floor
is
clear
too

sir
very
good
i
have
done
the
dungeons
there
is
no
sign
of
serius
black
nor
anywhere
else
in
the
castle
i
dont
seriously
expect
him
to
lay
there
remarkeble
feat

dont
you
think
to
enter
the
hogwarts
castle

on
ones
own

completely
undetected
quite
remarkebly

yes

any
theory
on
how
he
managed
it
too
many

each
is
as
unlikely
as
the
next
one
as
you
may
recall

prior
to
the
start
of
the
term
i
expect
concern
about
the
appointment
of
professor
there
is
not
a
single
professor
inside
this
castle
who
would
help
sirius
black
to
enter
it
i
am
convinced
the
castle
is
safe
and
i
am
more
than
willing
to
send
the
students
back
to
their
houses
what
about
potter
should
he
be
warned
perhaps

but
now
let
him
sleep
in
sleep

we
enter
a
world
entirely
our
own
that
might
be
swimming
in
the
deepest
ocean
or
glide
over
the
highest
cloud
turn
to
the
page
excuse
me

sir
where
is
professor
lupin
that
is
not
really
your
concern

is
it
potter
suffice
to
say
to
that
your
professor
finds
himself
incapable
of
teaching
at
the
present
time
werewolves
but
sir

we
have
just
begun
the
new
the
chapter
of
hinky
punks
we
are
not
meant
to
start
nocturnal
beasts
in
weeks
quiet
how
did
she
come
in
did
you
see
her
come
in
which
one
of
you
can
say
to
me
the
difference
between
an
animago
and
a
werewolf
no
one
how
disappointing
please
sir

an
animago
is
a
wizard
who
elects
to
turn
into
animal
a
werewolf
has
no
choice
with
each
full
moon
when
he
transforms
he
no
longer
remembers
who
he
is
he
will
kill
his
best
friend
if
he
crosses
the
path
further
more

the
warewolf
only
responds
to
calls
of
it
own
kind
this
is
the
second
time
you
have
spoken
out
of
turn
miss
granger
are
you
incapable
of
restraining
yourself
or
you
take
pride
in
being
insufferable
know
it
all
hes
got
a
point

you
know
points
from
griffendor
as
an
antidote
to
your
ignorance
and
on
my
desk
by
monday
morning
i
want

rows
on
aparchment
on
the
werewolves
with
perticular
emphasizing
on
recognizing
it
but
sir

its
quiddich
tomorrow
then
i
suggest
you
take
extra
care

mr

potter
loss
of
limb
will
not
excuse
it
page
term
werewolf
is
a
contraction
of
the
anglosaxon
word
were

which
mean
man
and
wolf
warewolf
there
are
several
ways
to
become
a
warewolf
go
harry
arresto
momento
he
looks
a
bit
peaky
peaky
what
did
you
expect
he
fell
over

feet
come
on
ron

lets
walk
you
up
to
the
astronomi
tower
and
see
what
you
would
look
like
probably
a
better
than
he
normally
does
i
feel
brilliant
you
gave
us
right
good
scare
there

mate
what
happened
oh

you
fell
of
your
broom
i
meant
the
match

who
won
no
one
blames
you

harry
the
dementores
arent
supposed
to
come
inside
the
ground
dumbledore
was
furious
as
soon
as
he
saved
you

he
send
them
straight
off
there
is
something
else
you
should
know
too

harry
when
you
fell
your
broom

it
sort
of
blew
into
the
wamping
willow
i
am
sorry
to
hear
about
your
broom
stick
is
there
any
chance
of
fixing
it
professor

why
do
the
dementores
affect
me
so
i
mean

more
than
everyone
else
the
dementores
are
among
the
faulest
creatures
to
walk
this
earth
they
feed
of
every
good
feeling

every
happy
memory
until
the
person
is
left
with
absolutely
nothing
but
his
worst
experiences
you
are
not
weak

harry
the
dementores
affect
you
most
of
all
because
there
are
true
horrors
in
your
past
horrors
your
classmates
can
scarcely
imagine
you
have
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
i
am
scared
professor
well

i
would
consider
you
a
fool
if
you
werent
i
need
to
know
how
to
fight
them
you
could
teach
me
you
made
that
dementor
on
the
train
go
away
there
was
only
one
that
night
but
you
made
it
go
away
i
dont
pretend
to
be
an
expert

harry
but
as
the
demontors

the
ministery
wasnt
sending
dementores
into
my
pub
every
other
night
sirius
black
in
hogsmeade

and
what
would
bring

proffesor
dumbledoor

taking
care
of
it
now

this
i
can
assure
you
now

tell
me
what
this
is
all
about
well

now
years
ago
when
harry
potters
parents
realized
they
were
not
destined
to

you
know
what
they
went
into
hiding
and
no
one
realized
where
they
were
and
the
one
who
did
was
sirius
black
and
he
told
you
know
who
and
black
lead
you
know
who
to
potters
cell
but
he
also
killed
one
of
their
friends

peter
pettigrew
peter
pettigrew
that
lump
of
a
boy
always
trailing
after
serius
black
and
never
left
james
and
serius
out
of
his
sight
but
what
happened
peter
pettigrew
tried
to
warn
the
potters
and
might
have
managed
to

if
he
hadnt
run
into
old
friend
serius
black
black
was
vicious

he
did
not
kill
he
destroy
it
a
finger
that
all
was
left
a
finger
nothing
else
sirius
black
may
not
put
his
hands
to
the
potters

but
he
is
the
reason
they
are
dead
and
now
he
finish
what
he
started
i
dont
believe
it
thats
not
the
worst
of
it
what
could
be
worse
sirius
black
was
and
remains
to
this
day
harry
potters
godfather
look
sorry

excuse
me
harry

what
happened
he
was
their
friend
and
he
betrayed
them
i
hope
he
finds
me
and
when
he
does
im
gonna
be
ready
when
he
does

im
gonna
kill
him
are
you
sure
of
this
harry
you
know
that
it
is
very
advanced
magic

well
beyond
the
ordinary
wizardary
level
i
am
sure
well

everything
is
prepared
now
the
spell
i
am
going
to
try
to
teach
you
is
called
a
patronum
charm
you
ever
hear
of
it
the
patronum
is
a
kind
of
positive
force
and
for
the
wizard
that
can
conjure
one

it
works
something
like
a
shield
with
the
dementor
feeding
on
it
rather
than
him
and
in
order
for
that
it
to
work

you
need
to
think
of
a
memory
it
has
to
be
a
memory
happy
memory
and
a
powerful
memory
can
you
do
this
yes
there
we
go
close
your
eyes
concentrate
explore
your
past
do
you
have
a
memory
allow
it
to
fill
you
up
lose
yourself
in
it
then
speak
the
encartation
wand
to
the
ready
expecto
expect
come
on

sit
up
deep
breaths
i
did
not
expect
you
to
do
it
the
first
time
that
would
have
been
remarkable
here

eats
this
thats
one
nasty
dementor
oh
no

no

no
that
was
a
bogart
harry

a
bogart
the
real
one
is
worse

very
much

much
worse
as
a
matter
of
interest
what
were
you
thinking
what
memory
did
you
choose
the
first
time
i
rode
a
broom
thats
not
good
enough
not
nearly
good
enough
there
is
another
it
is
not
happy
exactly
the
happiest
i
ever
felt
but
it
is
very
complicated
is
it
strong
then
lets
give
it
a
try
if
you
are
ready
just
do
it
well
done

harry
well
done
i
think
i
had
enough
for
today
yes

sit
down
here
eat
this

it
helps
it
really
helps
and
just
so
you
know
harry
i
think
you
would
have
given
your
father
a
run
for
his
money
and
that

is
saying
something
i
was
thinking
about
him
and
mom
seeing
their
faces
they
were
talking
me
just
talking
thats
the
memory
i
chose
i
do
not
even
know
if
it
was
real
but
it
is
the
best
i
have
beautiful
day
unless
of
course

you
have
been
ripped
to
pieces
ripped
to
pieces
what
are
you
talking
about
ronald
has
lost
his
rat
i
havnt
lost
anything
your
cat
killed
it
harry

you
have
seen
the
way
that
bloodthirsty
beast
of
her
is
always
lurking
about
scabbers
is
gone
maybe
you
should
learn
to
take
better
care
of
your
pets
you
cat
killed
him
did
not
did
didnt
how
did
it
go
hagrid
the
hearing
well
first
of
the
commitee
members
took
turns
talking
about
why
we
were
there
and
then
i
got
up

did
my
piece
i
said
that
buckbeak
was
a
good
hippogriff
always
cleaning
his
feathers
and
then
lucius
malfoy
got
up
and
you
can
imagine
what
he
said
buckbeak
was
a
deadly
and
dangerous
creature
who
would
kill
you
as
soon
as
he
look
at
you
and
then
and
then
he
asked
for
the
worst
thing

you
know
lucius
they
are
not
sacking
you
no

i
am
not
sacked
buckbeack
has
been
sentenced
to
death
that
lump
of
a
boy
always
trailing
after
sirius
black
veciously
killed
him
he
didnt
just
kill
him
he
destroyed
it
put
that
light
out
sorry
watch
it
there
boy

we
are
trying
to
sleep
here
yes
we
are
mischief
managed
knox
potter
what
are
you
doing
here
wandering
the
corridoors
of
the
night
im
a
sleep
walker
extra
ordinarily
like
your
father
you
are
he
too
was
exceedingly
arrogant
strutting
about
the
castle
my
dad
didnt
strut
and
nor
do
i
now
if
you
dont
mind
i
appriciate
it
if
could
you
lower
your
wand
turn
out
your
pockets
whats
this
its
a
backdoor
aparchment
really
reveal

your
secrets
read
it
messrs
mooney

wormtail

patfoot
and
pronce
offer
their
compliments
to
proffesor
snape
and

go
on
and
request
that
he
keeps
out
his
abnormally
large
nose
out
of
other
peoples
business
why

you
insolent

little
well

well
lupin
out
for
a
little
walk
in
the
moon
light
that
remains
to
be
seen
i
have
just
now
confiscated
a
rather
curious
artifact
from
mr

potter
take
a
look
lupin
it
is
supposed
that
it
is
your
area
of
expertise
clearly

its
full
of
dark
magic
i
seriously
doubt
that
its
something
serious
its
merly
looks
to
be
an
aparchment
designed
to
insult
anyone
who
tries
to
read
it
i
suspect
that
it
is
a
zonco
product
nevertheless
i
should
investigate
any
hidden
qualities
it
may
possess
it
is
afterall
an
area
of
my
expertise
harry

would
you
come
with
me

please
professor

good
night
are
you
deaf
put
that
light
out
come
in
now

i
have
not
the
faintest
idea
harry
how
this
map
came
to
be
in
your
possession
quite
frankly

i
am
astound
that
you
didnt
hand
it
in
didnt
it
ever
occured
to
you
that
this
in
the
hands
of
sirius
black
is
a
map
to
you
your
father
never
set
much
store
by
the
rules
either
but
he
and
your
mother
gave
their
lives
to
save
yours
and
gambling
their
sacrifice
by
wandering
around
the
castle
unprotected
with
a
killer
on
the
lose
seems
to
be
a
very
poor
way
to
repay
them
now
i
will
not
cover
up
for
you
again

harry
do
you
hear
me
i
want
that
you
return
to
your
dormetry

and
stay
there
dont
take
any
detours
if
you
do
i
shall
know
just
so
you
know

i
dont
think
that
map
always
works
earlier
on

it
showed
some
one
in
the
castle
some
one
i
know
to
be
dead
really

who
might
that
be
its
just
what
i
saw
good
night

professor
broaden
your
minds
you
must
look
beyond
the
art
of
crystal
gazing
is
in
the
clearing
of
the
inner
eye
only
then
can
you
see
it
try
again
now

what
we
have
here
do
you
mind
me
trying
the
grim

possibly
from
the
first
moment
you
stepped
foot
in
my
class
i
sensed
that
you
do
not
possess
see
right
here

youre
young
in
years
but
the
heart
that
beats
beneath
your
bosom
is
as
shriveled
as
an
old
maids
your
soul
as
dry
as
the
pages
of
the
books
to
which
you
so
desperately
cleave
have
i
said
something
she
has
gone
mental

hermione
has
not
that
she
was
not
always
mental
but
know
it
is
certainly
for
everyone
to
see
we
better
take
this
back
i
am
not
going
back
see
you
later
see
you
professor
trelawney
he
will
return
tonight
tonight
he
who
betrayed
his
friends
his
heart
is
frought
with
murder
shall
break
free
innocent
blood
will
shall
be
spilled
and
servant
and
master
shall
be
reunited
once
more
i

keen
and
penetrating

wrong
conclusion

longing
to
see

i
detect
a
flicker
of
fear

dementors

only
imagine
what
that
would
be
like
to
endure

is
said

nearly
unbearable
to
witness

will
do
my
best
severus

what
all
they
could
find
of

killed
your
dad

a
very
sweet
disposition

be
here
but
you
are
innocent
and
you

it
for
now
that

i

tired

so
like
your
father

your
eyes

my
mothers
eyes
it
is
cruel
that
i
got
to
spent
so
much
time
with
james
and
lily
and
you
so
little
but
know
this
the
ones
we

never
truly
leave
us
and

always
find
it
in

the
brightest
witch

your

there
what
is
he
talking
about
harry
i
do
not

honestly
ron

how
can
somebody
be
at
two
places
at
once
hello
harry
i
saw
you
coming
i
have
looked
worse

believe
me
you
have
been
sacked
no

no

i
resigned
resigned

why
well

it
seemed
that
somebody

let
slip
the
nature
of
my
condition
at
this
time
tomorrow
the
owls
will
start
arriving
and
parents
will
not
want
a
well

someone
like
me
teaching
their
children
but
dumbledore
dumbledore
has
already
risked
enough
for
my
behalf
besides

people
like
me
are
well

lets
just
say
i
am
use
to
it
by
now
why
do
you
look
so
miserable
harry
none
of
it
made
any
difference

pettigrew
escaped
didnt
make
any
difference
harry

it
made
all
the
difference
in
the
world
you
help
uncover
the
truth
you
saved
an
innocent
man
from
a
terrible
fate
may
be
great
deal
of
difference
if
i
am
proud
of
anything
it
is
of
how
much
you
have
learned
this
year
and
since
i
am
no
longer
your
teacher

i
feel
no
guilt
whatsoever
for
giving
this
back
so
now
i
say
goodbye

i
feel
sure
we
will
meet
again
sometime
until
then
stand
back
i
said
i
will
take
it
upstairs
if
you
upset
it
harry

where
ever
did
you
get
it
cant
let
it
go
harry

after
you
of
course
what
are
you
talking
about
quiet
let
the
man
through
i
did
not
want
to
open
it
harry

it
was
badly
wrapped
they
made
me
do
it
did
not

the
firebolt
the
fastest
broom
in
the
world
who
sent
it
no
one

came
with
it
go
on
harry

my
true
love

ompa
loompas

i
really
hate
those
stickers
they
put
on
apples
by
the
time
you
peel
it
off

you
dont
want
the
apple
anymore
i
sometimes
wish
i
could
just
crawl
up
with
a
girl
just
hold
each
other

like
that
picture
of
john
lennon
and
yoko
no
that
is
so
sweet

when
it
happened

champagne

had
to
find
her
what
youre
getting
so
bad
out
of
shape
for

man
i
mean

its
just
a
girl

shouldve
expected
you
to
say
that
you
revel
in
the
size
of
your
dumps

gotta
check
this
out

isnt

another
girl

rod

i
connected
with
her
id
pulled
down
my
pants

and
vickie
poured
sand
on
my
winky
this
is
better
than
playing
with
you
shovel

man
i
started
taping
my
pecker
so
that
it
would
stay
up
all
the
time
i
did
the
same
thing

but
i
used
duct
tape

trying
to
make
a
point
here
ive
never
had
this
kind
of
success
with
a
woman
before
on
my
hands
so
i
had
a
list
of
topics
i
could
talk
to
the
girls
about
whats
that
on
your
hand
nothing
my
romantic
iq
mustve
mashed
me

because
i
showed
the
girl
my
list

the
biggest
loser
of
all
time
and
didnt
even
get
a
kiss
of
good
night
what
the
hell
is

help
me
increase
length
and
girth
by
hanging
weights

man
whats
that
have
to
do
with
anything
i
dont
know

i
just
like
to
say
it
this
penile
power
thing

gonna
help
me
increase
my
libido

me
maintain
a
full
firm
erection
and
its
gonna
help
me
control
my
ejaculation

years
of
life

lost
working
while
women
stayed
home
man

all
you
gotta
do
is
find
the
matching
bra
to
those
panties
rod

i
focused
all
my
great
cerebral
powers
to
come
up
with
this
bold
plan
to
penetrate
the
vault
instead
of
cinderellas
glass
slippers

i
had
her
panties
what
are
you
doing
stop
it
a
few
verbal
punches

on
me

names
crick
youre
the
worst
kind
of
cool

the
kind
who
wears
male
makeup
a
real
fashion
plate
what
was
the
worse
crick
was
hopped
upon
nicotine
gum
a
chainchewer

and
he
chewed
his
gum
with
his
mouth
open
i
hated
that
noise

it
was
my
kryptonite
im
here
so
save
her

save
her
how
are
you
gonna
do
that
crick
wasnt
wearing
a
shirt

his
nipples
stood
out
like
knobs
on
an
old
tv

i
dont
know
what
possessed
me
probably
his
incessant
nicotinegum
chewing
but
my
hands
reached
out
like
they
were
drawing
twin
guns
i
grabbed
his
nipples
and
did
a
double
twist
but

somehow

through
his
blur
of
pain

crick
fought
back
he
grabbed
my
nipples
and
twisted
it
was
tit
for
tat
and
i
cracked
they
are
two
black
eyes
now
in
college

you
call
me
a
good
time

like
my
skirt

but
youre
thinking
and
would
have
to
put
gloss
on
another
pair
of
lips
i
was
lying

i
did
think
all
those
things
she
had
a
cuteness
that
set
off
my
hairtrigger
response
what
whats
wrong
you
dont
like
me

no

i
like
you
just
fine
youre
worried
about
what
people
say
about
me
what
are
these
are
these
stress
balls
to
relieve
tension

like
humphrey
bogart
did
in
that
old
movie
theres
three
ways
to
do
things
aboard
my
vessel
the
right
way

the
wrong
way
and
my
way
if
you
do
things
my
way

well
get
along
just
fine
pinball
balls

i
put
them
inside
of
me

i
rock
my
legs
and
i
get
off
really
penile
power
it
seems
to
be
causing
a
little
pain

if
you
know
what
i
mean
so
whats
plan
b

mr

coyote
im
gonna
continue
searching
everyday

between
classes
and
homework

ill
create
a
problem
you
won
the
morning
prize

a
new
car
it
was
a
feast
for
the
eyes
i
need
some
help
in
my
room
it
is
a
test
of
dominance
between
a
man
and
a
woman

cards
are
stacked
against
the
man
he
wants
to
check
out
her
breasts
a
man
must
summon
all
his
will
not
to
lookdown
at
those
golden
orbs
whose
wondrous
tips
are
upturned

aimed
right
at
his
eyes
once
a
man
loses
this
test
of
nerves
the
woman
knows
she
has
a
great
secret
power
over
him
and
she
can
get
him
to
do
anything
she
wants
strange

it
was
getting
only
espn

yeah

its
weird
its
a
bad
sign
when
you
meet
a
girl
who
wears
no
makeup
unfortunately

i
didnt
heed
the
warnings
arlene
suckered
me
into
a
game
of
strip
foosball
prepare
to
get
naked
i
dont
know
why
you
girls
get
such
fiendish
delight
in
defeating
men
weve
been
emasculated
all
life

youre
just
trying
to
distract
me
im
serious

my
mom
taught
me
who
was
boss
when
i
was

years
old
she
started
spanking
me
with
a
wooden
spoon
my
greatest
fear
was
being
realized
what
if
she
saw
me
getting
beaten
by
a
girl
its
goal
time
score
now
i
wanna
see
my
trophy
take
the
breasts

for
example
im
not
just
talking
about
the
little
habits
we
have
were
grotesque
to
the
core

look
at
the
penis
it
looks
like
god
had
some
leftover
skin
when
he
was
making
elbow
do
you
have
any
suspects
yet
no

theres
too
many
choices
their
dorm
is
a
whitman
sampler
of
women
a
virtual
potpourri
of
pussy
its
more
than
sex

those
women
have
distinct
personalities
its
ren�

she
writes
cheat
notes
on
her
breasts
see
next
door
thats
sasha

shes
totally
into
purple
have
you
seen
that
girl
at
the
front
desk

rhonda
and
youre
right

some
girls
watch
jane
austen
movies
every
friday
my
god

lets
watch
it
tonight

ill
make
the
popcorn
shes
always
on
the
phone
crying
with
her
longdistance
boyfriend
whos
that
girl
with
the
green
slime

man
and
whos
the
hummer
on
three
thats
michelle
she
sounds
like
some
kind
of
buddhist
monk

dont
you
think
so

have
you
got
any
more
suspicious
suspects
yet
i
have
that
one
girl
who
never
comes
out
of
her
room
i
bet
you
that
shes
your
mystery
woman
hurry
up

the
movie
is
at


i
cant
lock
the
door
forget
about
it

were
gonna
miss
the
trailer
for
north
anger
abbey
saturday
nights
were
the
best
for
sneaking
into
girls
rooms
except
for
dora

she
never
had
anywhere
to
go
on
saturday
night
shes
the
kind
of
girl
about
whom
rod
would
say
but
i
felt
for
her
people
treat
you
like
you
have
the
ebola
virus
they
dont
wanna
get
near

because
what
you
have
might
be
contagious
this
women
studies
class
is
gonna
be
a
breeze
today
we
are
gonna
study
patriarchal
infrastructures
that
exercise
genderbased
discrimination
the
pope
wont
allow
women
priests
an
older
man
can
go
out
with
a
young
woman

but
an
older
woman
none
of
you
ever
last
now
elsa

of
the
ss

is
gonna
make
me
lose
it
one
saturday

i
got
careless
disasters
truck
moments
after
i
had
to
drain
my
main
vein
they
see
things
that
go
undetected
to
a
mans
eye
and
i
was
such
a
fool
its
me

wendy

from
eleventh
grade
trig
im
looking
for
this
girl

lf
you
dont
believe
me

check
my
right
pocket
so
youre
gonna
check
every
girl
lf
i
can
ever
see
again
finally
my
romantic
quest
was
rewarded

she
was
a
goddess
i
think
even
the
word
love
was
used
great

here
we
go
again
hear
me
out

man

women
complain
that
all
men
want
that
they
have
to
live
up
to
this
expectation

but
what
about
us
we
live
with
the
disappointment
that
our
women
wont
look
like
it
weve
been
conditioned
to
expect
something
that
well
never
get
while
we
get
better
over
time

we
get
with
women
with
saggy
tits
who
start
wearing
those
bathing
suits
that
cover
the
bellybuttons
making
love
to
a
woman
turns
a
man
into
a
cellulite
surfer
who
gets
the
better
in
the
deal
i
wonder
what
promnight
succubus
or
seconddate
siren
can
you
believe
ive
gained
a
half
an
inch
since
i
started
using
this
in
your
case

from
the
neck
up

screw
you

man
so

hey

what
are
you
reading
ive
no
clue
anymore
how
to
find
my
blackout
knockout
so
every
week
i
take
up
a
personal
ad
in
the
school
newspaper
so

in
complete
darkness

we
can
renew
our
relationship
until
both
of
us
decide
to
reveal
our
identities
you
sit
in
the
dark
every
thursday
night
youre
a
sick
man

youre
a
freak
and
if
shes
easy

take
her
twice
my
whole
operation
was
a
romantic
bay
of
pigs
id
already
spent
several
thursday
nights
in
the
dark
and
shed
yet
to
show
up
its
me

wendy
she
didnt
come

did
she
no
everything
she
did
was
perfect
she
was
arousing
in
that
virginal
maryann

not
ginger
sort
of
way
shes
the
kind
of
girl
you
take
home
to
mom
and
even
scarier

shes
the
kind
you
marry
and
she
becomes
your
mom
she
dresses
you

feeds
you
youre
settling
for
just
the
average
what
i
hate
when
people
say
that

i
dont
wanna
be
perfect
he
made
this
creepy
and
just
super
creepy
so
i
hid
under
my
covers
and
that
music
it
scared
me
so
much
sometimes

do
you
know
what
i
did
to
calm
myself
i
remembered
that
dorothy
killed
the
witch
by
putting
water
on
her
so
id
lie
in
bed
and
id
work
up
this
big
water
spit
why
is
that
the
force
is
strong
with
this
one
i
cant
breathe
fascinating
its
one
big
symbol
for
easy
access
have
you
ever
calculated
how
many
hours
women
have
wasted
foxy
lady
girls
are
way
grosser
than
guys
a
friend
had
sex
in
an
elevator

have
any
of
you
ever
tried
that
then
he
blamed
when
he
got
athletes
foot
on
his
dong
francescas
night
was
a
major
bust

that
stunk
its
fake
and
processed

just
like
america
tell
me
something
everyday

i
thought
i
was
a
fanatic
i
even
got
one
of
those
plastic
covers
you
dont
have
to
hold
on
a
second
ill
come
to
you
come
on
im
coming

cynthia
so
whats
the
big
deal
im
not
stupid

i
get
things
easy
the
guys
will
do
anything
for
me
because
of
the
way
i
look
i
know
that
and
if
sam
saw
me
in
these
i
might
lose
my
edge
with
him
who
never
mind

youre
lucky
no

im
not
no

its
a
curse

you
see
nothing
is
a
challenge
for
me

everything
is
made
easy
everyone
assumes
that
i
got
there
because
of
my
looks

it
sucks
so
ready
to
go
again
theres
nothing
at
stake

how
do
you
mean
shes
a
super
bowl
of
women
then
every
other
girl
after
cynthia
is
gonna
seem
like
a
compromise
nothing

its
gotta
be
something
they
called
me
so
in
high
school

im
sorry
maybe
she
could
tell
still
thought
she
was
contagious
girls
are
just
users

look
at
the
praying
mantis

for
instance
and
a
person
is
an
extension
of
a
womans
vagina
score
yeah

but
about
all
the
right
things
goal
two
zip

time
to
strip
what
all
the
newlyweds
get
kitchen
stuff

girlie
crap
small
tradeoff
for
having
to
cook
for
some
lazy
ass
man
goal
at
least

we
dont
start
wars
maybe
if
we
got
laid
a
little
bit
more
often

we
wouldnt
be
so
maybe
youd
get
laid
more
often

if
you
knew
what
youre
doing
in
bed
were
more
willing
to
give
pleasure

were
less
selfish
so
are
you

i
am
not
goal

you
cheated
how
can
you
do
that
i
wasnt
even
looking
this
was
bad

this
wasnt
my
glorious
wrestling
fancy
you
cheated

admit
it
we
didnt
lay
down
any
rules
maybe
that
was
the
problem
we
had
giant
steels
takes
for
a
heart
and
were
spinning
out
of
control
i
was
just
as
bad
as
rod

but
i
finally
had
something
to
say
each
side
thinks
theyre
playing
fair
and
theyre
being
cheated
maybe
this
is
why
men
and
women
bring
out
the
poison
in
one
another
rubbish
we
all
know
there
are
rules
of
western
civilization
i
checked
on
the
girl
who
never
came
out
of
her
room
then
i
noticed
that
dora
wasnt
in
her
usual
spot
shes
up
there
why
arent
you
doing
anything
she
does
this
every
semester
id
break
the
vcrs
o
those
girls
couldnt
watch
jane
austen
movies
lets
play
west
the
first
time
i
did
this

nobody
noticed
i
was
born
with
the
greatest
curse

whats
that
im
ugly
and
im
also
very
smart
people
all
around
me
will
be
falling
in
love
and
making
love
the
closest
thing
ill
ever
have
to
that
maybe
she
noticed
the
change
in
me
youre
probably
right
i
found
out
what
dora
was
reading
all
those
saturday
nights
can
you
imagine
someone
being
that
passionate
for
you
i
set
the
shores
a
little
wider

i
ironed
out
the
wrinkles
after
me

you
can
take
on
stallions

bulls

rams
being
francesca
has
its
disadvantages
what
happened
so
thats
what
hes
doing
to
me
right
there
with
the
way
men
are

women
could
initiate
the
sexual
battle
guys
are
just
simply
always
willing
to
volunteer
for
sex
i
tested
the
concept
with
rod
you
just
said
i
love
you
no

you
got
me
wrong

i
said
olive
soup
so
he
was
all
ready
to
do
it
with
you
men
only
go
shopping
when
we
know
exactly
what
were
gonna
get
men
and
women
treat
sex
the
exact
same
way
thank
you
i
think
youre
right

ive
got
a
cookie
for
you
here
patty
had
a
way
of
even
making
captain
crunch
sound
sexy
no

i
have
work
to
do
theres
a
certain
way
a
man
stares
at
the
woman
he
loves
you
know
how
captain
hook
could
always
hear
the
crocodile
from
the
tictac
of
his
clock
in
the
crocks
belly
i
knew
id
find
you
two
together

he
was
all
high
on
nicotine
gum
i
had
to
get
patty
out
of
there
you
know
something

crick

i
was
wondering
the
bad
guys
of
the
world
really
know
theyre
being
bad
or
they
think
theyre
good
guys
when
they
act
like
sphincters
i
dont
know

you
tell
me

smart
guy
cool
thats
another
thing
that
bothers
me
what
is
that
like
a
billion
people
are
cool
that
just
cant
be
right
i
had
enough
of
you

buddy
what
was
that
my
pinball
balls
patty
came
on
to
me
again

and
succumbed
maybe
this
is
why
god
made
women
like
this
sweet
leaping
jesus
l
wish
i
had
made
love
less
no

here

let
me
help
you
if
not
better
than
every
other
man
our
transcendent
fusion
was
not
the
romantic
type

it
was
just
fun
my
experience
with
her
was
not
serious
and
nothing
cosmic
did
i
tell
you
im
up
to

pounds
over
here
i
treated
her
like
she
was
my
sexual
training
wheels
and
what
if
the
elevator
girl
finds
out
shes
gonna
think
im
a
dick
you
should
embrace
your
destiny

not
deny
it
theres
no
problem

something
had
happened

i
knew
it
there
was
definitely
a
horror
in
rods
past
and
it
was
the
encounter
with
the
monster
that
rod
called
woman
whats
your
horror
story
theres
no
story

man
maybe
if
you
tried
this
thing

you
wouldnt
be
so
nervous
all
the
time
yeah
what
girl
yeah

right
yeah

man

shes
doable
matthew
youre
here
wait

can
you
wait

hey

wait
i
chased
her
like
i
was
popeye
doyle
chasing
that
train
got
you
i
lost
her
do
you
wanna
talk
about
it
no

im
okay
my
antiintimacy
force
field
was
on
the
autopilot
i
was
feeling
so
bad

i
decided
to
put
the
antiintimacy
on
manual
or
she
was
drunk
that
night
and
she
didnt
remember
r
i
deluded
myself
into
thinking
she
thought
i
was
some
premed
i
shouldve
figured
it
had
something
to
do
with
me
testosterone
must
really
fill
the
ego

because
ive
stored
plenty
of
both

im
just
a
big
steaming
pile
of
loser
what
do
you
think
i
am
its
midnight
and
im
cleaning
my
room
is
your
mom
coming
tomorrow
yeah

you
guessed
it
how
do
you
get
along
with
your
folks
in
th
grade

i
wanted
to
read
these
james
bond
novels
parents
always
try
to
turn
us
into
something
we
dont
wanna
be
i
wish
i
could
be
more
than
my
parents
perfect
little
girl
that
looks
like
fun
this
is
matt
look
what
it
did
to
my
pride
and
prejudice
tape
this
is
a
catastrophe
maybe
my
cosmetic
destiny
might
change
her
opinion
of
me
she
was
out
there
somewhere
watching
me
was
peace
in
the
gender
war

another
point

pussies
forget
it

im
outta
here

come
on

just
one
more
game
i
was
a
maze
by
how
well
arlene
and
i
complemented
each
other
arlene
had
a
soft
touch

knowing
just
where
to
set
me
up
she
let
my
power
game
do
its
magic
she
was
an
excellent
cheerleader
my
balls
and
her
energy
drove
us
to
new
performance
heights
potato
chips
and
soda

men
and
women
you
keep
your
arm
on
your
side
it
leaves
me
in
the
street

looking
at
my
father
is
his
under
weareating
icecream
sandwich
some
role
model

right
i
love
women
its
more
than
the
only
part
of
the
body
you
easily
see
naked
or
if
you
follow
the
graceful
line
of
the
pectoral
is
major
it
inevitably
draws
your
eyes
to
the
golden
orbs
god
is
in
the
details

and
the
nipple
is
his
greatest
detail
dora
loved
the
video
i
made
of
her
see
youre
beautiful
so

cynthia

why
arent
you
out
on
a
saturday
night
because
my
face
got
flattened
like
road
kill
after
the
couch
fell
on
me
it
was
weird
that
i
felt
comfortable
talking
to
her
now
that
her
looks
didnt
distract
me
so
what
are
you
reading
world
religion
and
us
this
guy
was
supposed
to
give
me
his
notes

but
he
never
called
me
isnt
that
interesting
perhaps
jesus
didnt
perform
any
miracle
we
thought
he
did

because
we
made
a
mistake
in
the
translations
i
hear
you

but
you
know
whats
really
messed
up
god
loves
us

right
id
been
avoiding
patty
for
a
while

i
didnt
know
how
to
handle
it
hes
not
my
type
really

why
is
that
it
was
then
that
i
heard
the
cracking
of
cricks
nicotine
gum
can
we
talk
about
this
later
no

well
talk
about
it
right
now
you
want
to
some
of
me
too
it
looks
like
its
just
the
two
of
us
all
that
went
through
my
mind
was
what
crick
had
in
store
for
me
now
give
us
a
kiss
i
had
to
do
something
i
dont
understand
women

but

for
a
moment
i
didnt
tell
anyone
about
what
happened

i
was
too
ashamed
its
called
hypospadias

the
hole
in
your
dick
is
its
not
on
the
tip

its
underneath
sort
of
dont
tell
anyone

alright
specially
those
girls
youve
been
hanging
out
with
i
showed
it
to
a
girl
once

and
she
freaked
out
i
havent
taken
it
out
in
front
of

fire

long
rifle
slugs

he
comes
across
a

dark
remote
spot

attacks
with
hesitation
the

scott
walter

you
two
were
together
anything
you
can
tell
us

scott
anything
she
dated
a
lot
of
guys
so
do
you
think

scott
that
it
might
have
been
one
of
her
boyfriends
she
was
acting
strange
just
before
sort
of
felt
like
we
were
being
watched
scott

is
there
anything
else
you
can
tell
us
about
his
physical
appearance
he
had
the
light
in
our
eyes

i
thought
it
was
a
cop
i
thought
it
was
a
cop
im
afraid
you
gentlemen
are
going
to
need
to
leave
now
he
needs
to
rest
scott

listen
if
anything
comes
to
mind

you
contact

even
at
this
moment
scott
walton
may
be
providing
police
with
vital
information
at
the
himut
valley
golf
course
on
the
fourth
of
july
perhaps
an
artists
drawing
will
finally
help
the
police
make
some
progress
in
capturing
this
elusive
madman
in
his
taunting
phone
call
to
the
police
the
killer
boasted
of
a
double
murder
but
in
fact
he
failed
to
kill
scott
walton
he
failed
to
kill
him
man

this
bullshit
theory
about
there
being
a
bloodthirsty
killer
on
the
loose
and
we
dont
know
this
guy
is
the
same
guy
that
killed
the
other
kid
so
what
if
he
makes
a
phone
call
what
does
that
prove
proves
he
likes
to
brag

the
son
of
a
bitch
doesnt
mean
he
really
did
it
i
still
think
it
was
one
of
gils
boyfriends
listen
to
you
tow

boyfriends

husbands

it
could
have
been
anybody
that
guy

he
didnt
kill
out
of
passion

he
didnt
kill
out
of
anger
he
shot
them
at
random
just
because
they
were
there
wrong
place

wrong
fucking
time
i
think
that
he
might
have
had
training
as
an
officer
oh
matt

thats
crazy

we
dont

we
dont
have
any
evidence
why
a
guy
pulls
up
right
behind
a
car
at
an
angle

drivers
side
thats
standard
police
procedure
walks
up
to
the
car

approaches
them
with
a
flashlight
shines
them
right
in
the
face
so
they
cant
see
his
thats
another
standard
police
procedure
its
obvious
that
this
guy
is
familiar
with
weapons
specifically
handguns
probably
years
of
training
with
handguns
this
shit
moves
in
and
out
without
leaving
a
clue
a
fucking
clue
matt

where
are
you
going
with
this
no

where
are
you
going

start
looking
for

our
own
department

saying

im
fucking
saying
mare
isiand
what
if
he
was

whatd
the
lab

pick
one
up
at
any
drug
store
in
the
country
same
goes
for
the
paper
umm

was
probably
wearing
gloves

handled
the
letter
wearing
gloves
print
analysis

at
least
what

a
couple
hours

been
writing
with
his
left
you
see
the
way

the
ks

the
ts
slant

misspelling
tell
us
anything
about
his
background
you
got
any
word
on
cipher

a
fairly
elaborate
cryptogram
or
code
similar
to
those
used
by
military
intelligence
in
world
war
two
and
korea
he
wrote
them
in
three
parts
if
you
put
the
three
parts
together
theres
a
message
but
its
gonna
take
a
lot
of
time
to
decipher
we
dont
have
any
time
it
says
here
hes
gonna
start
killing
people
tonight
yeah
perkins

panic
what

these
people
going
to
think
when
they
find
out
that
some
guy

more

her
home
right
now
and
you
stay
home
get
sticky
at
home

go
we
have
no
comment
at
this
time
why
do
you
think
he
hates
the
police
so
much
what
about
the
cryptogram

have
you
figured
that
out
yet
no
no
we
have
not
and
as
soon
as
we
do

we
will
get
to
you
guys

okay
detective

come
on

youve
gotta
give
us
a
comment
about
something
dale

give
me
a
break
what
can
i
help
you
yes

maam

uhh

could
i
have
a
word
with
you
sure
i
guess
she
always
had
a
lot
of
boyfriends
but

but
none
of
them
are
serious
and
gails
husband

randall

he
was
okay
with
this
sure

it
wasnt
a
big
deal

alright
she
usually
brought
the
guys
home
to
meet
randall
she
didnt
want
to
hide
anything
from
anyone
i
know
weve
asked
you
this
before
patsy
but

can
you
think
of
anyone
that
might
have
wanted
to
hurt
gail
no

gail
would
have
told
me
did
she
ever
date
anyone
from
mare
island
no

sailor
boys
arent
her
type
there
was
this
one
guy

sammy
i
think
he
worked
at
mare
island
for
a
little
while
he
had
a
couple
of
screws
loose
so
she
finally
told
him
to
get
lost
that
was
months
ago
you
got
a
last
name
caruso
i
think
or
carasko
he
was
a
mechanic

he
um

drove
an
old
blue
pickup
patsy
did
he
look
anything
like
that
i
dont
know

i
never
met
him
well

the
special
attention
hes
given
to
the
female
victims
shows
a
pattern
of
sorts
indicating
some
sort
of
sexual
disfunction
hes
obviously
intimidated
by
the
male
victime
as
he
attacks
them
first
facing
and
conquering
the
immediate
threat
why
teenagers
well
not
just
teenage
victims
but
victims
engaging
in
intimate
situations
of
a
potentially
sexual
nature
again

hes
attacking
what
i
see
as
his
own
fears
most
likely
a
victim
himself

childhood
abuse
or
trauma
i
suppose
his
anger
towards
women
stems
from
his
relationship
with
his
mother
so
uh

why
the
letters
and
the
phone
calls
this
is
a
very
disturbed
individual

i
believe
he
wants
to
be
caught
he
wants
help
and
until
he
gets
it
his
violent
tendencies
will
only
become
stronger
thank
you
for
coming
after
extensive
study
by
expert
criminal
investigators
we
have
concluded
that
the
author
of
the
letter
and
cryptogram
may
not
be
the
killer
that
we
are
seeking
if
he
really
did
kill
mary
boucher
michael
newman
and
gale
lewinson
then
he
must
provide
the
police
with
more
definite
proof
thats
your
new
strategy
to
become
pen
pals
with
the
killer
this
is
the
zodiac
speaking
in
answer
to
your
asking
for
more
details
about
the
good
times
i
have
had
in
vallejo
i
shall
be
very
happy
to
supply
even
more
material
by
the
way

have
the
police
been
having
a
good
time
with
the
code
if
not

tell
them
to
cheer
up
when
they
do
crack
it
they
will
have
me
on
the
fourth
of
july

i
did
not
open
my
car
door
the
windows
was
rolled
down
already
the
boy
was
originally
sitting
in
the
front
seat
when
i
began
firing
when
i
fired
the
first
shot
at
his
head
he
leapt
backward
at
the
same
time

thus
spoiling
my
aim
thats
how
i
shot
him
in
the
knee
the
man
who
told
the
police
my
car
was
brown
was
a
negro
about

or
rather
shabbily
dressed
i
was
in
this
phone
booth
having
some
fun
with
the
cops
when
he
was
walking
by
last
christmas

in
that
episode
police
were
wondering
as
to
how
i
could
shoot
my
victims
in
the
dark
what
i
did
was
tape
a
small
pencil
flashlight
to
the
barrel
of
my
gun
if
you
notice
in
the
center
of
the
beam
of
light
if
you
aim
it
at
a
wall
or
ceiling
you
will
see
a
black

dark
spot
in
the
center
of
the
circle
of
light
about
three
to
six
inches
across
taped
to
a
gun
barrel
the
bullet
will
strike
right
in
the
center
of
the
black
dot
in
the
light
all
i
had
to
do
was
spray
them
all
i
had
to
do
was
spray
them
should
i
leave
dads
place
whats
a
aphelion
aphelion

papers
too
he
can
probably
find
out
where
you
guys
live
i
never
saw
him
much

he
mostly
kept
to
himself
come
out
to
get
his
mail

about

ive
got
the
forwarding
address
downstairs
i
think
its
somewhere
on
sonoma
street
he
has
no
reason
to
hide
he
can
just
go
wherever
he
wants

no
one
will
notice
hes
not
crazy

nobody
seems
to
get
that
its
like
he
has
this
plan
and
hes
following
every
detail
out
of
all
the
places
in
the
world

why
did
he
come
here
maybe
he
didnt
come
here

maybe
he
grew
up
here

this

dale
coverling
reporting
live
im
here
in
the
town
of
salinas
miles
south
of
san
francisco
outside
the
home
of
two
amateur
detectives
who
broke
the
code
of
the
zodiacs
cryptogram
fred
and
sheila
morris
they
succeeded
where
the
police
and
the
naval
intelligence
center
failed
the
bizarre
content
of
the
zodiacs
message
proves
beyond
a
doubt
that
a
cold
blooded
monster
is
stocking
the
foothills
of
vallejo
the
decoded
message
reads

and
i
quote
i
like
killing
people
because
it
is
so
much
fun
it
is
more
fun
than
killing
wild
game
in
the
forest
man
is
the
most
dangerous
animal
of
all
to
kill
something
that
gives
me
the
most
thrilling
experience
it
is
even
better
than
getting
your
rocks
off
with
a
girl
i
will
not
give
you
my
name
because
you
will
try
to
slow
down
or
stop
my
collection
of
slaves

heres
some
old
hospital
records
on
that
cordoza
guy

now

the
whole
thing
is
over
not
without
a
positive
id
what
did
he
say
the
recent
attack
by
the
zodiac
killer
demonstrates
that
this
deranged
murder
is
also
willing
to
seek
victims
outside
the
vallejo
area
most
shocking
of
all
is
the
bizarre
costume
the
zodiac
wore
when
he
attacked
gina
chambers
and
paul
carmichael
miraculously

carmichael
survived
the
attack
despite
receiving
seven
vicious
knife
wounds
gina
chambers
was
not
so
fortunate
she
was
stabbed
a
total
of
thirteen
times
and
died
almost
immediately
the
police
seem
helpless
to
stop
the
zodiac
from
killing

will

way

consequences

if

so
much
as

his
name
again
you
will
have
chosen
that
future
for
him
what
is
thy
will
my
lord
imprisonment
for
all
time
far
from
you
for

centuries
i
was
a
loyal
soldier
of
the
vampire
clan
but
i
was
betrayed
the
war
was
not
as
it
had
seemed
in
one
night
the
lies
that
have
united
our
kind
has
been
exposed
craven
our
second
in
command
had
formed
a
secret
alliance
with
lucian
ruler
of
the
werewolf
clan
to
overthrow
viktor

our
leader
but
cravens
lust
for
power
and
domination
had
failed
viktor
is
not
the
savior
i
had
lead
to
believe
he
had
betrayed
us
all
soon
the
hunt
will
be
on
for
his
killer
i
have
but
one
ally
left

michael
the
human
descendent
of
corvinus
not
a
vampire
nor
lycan
but
a
hybrid
its
only
a
matter
of
time
before
were
found
my
only
hope
now
is
to
awaken
markus
our
last
remaining
elder
and
expose
the
truth
before
craven
tries
to
murder
him
while
still
in
hibernation
craven
knows
he
is
no
match
for
him
awake
this
thing
has
been
dead
for
weeks
i
thought
lycans
went
back
to
their
human
form
when
they
died
they
do

this
ones
been
given
a
serum
to
stop
regression
so
it
can
be
studied
how
can
you
tell
not
quite
your
department
i
guess
i
just
kill
them
dont
pay
much
attention
to
their
anatomy
how
long
can
we
stay
here
not
long
these
safe
houses
are
all
linked
together
on
one
mainframe
motion
sensors
say
which
ones
are
active
someone
could
have
picked
us
up
already
its
only
about
an
hour
to
daylight
can
you
even
make
it
back
to
the
mansion
before
sunrise
ok

lets
get
what
we
need
and
go
open
it
markus
the
blood
memories
of
this
wretched
creature
has
shown
me
that
your
treachery
knows
no
bounds
my
lord

i
can
explain
why
should
i
listen
to
your
lies
when
the
journey
to
the
truth
is
so
much
sweeter
i
kept
the
secrets
cleaned
up
the
mess
you
will
go
before
viktor
and
tell
him
exactly
what
i
tell
you
to
please
i
can
assist
you
oh
you
already
have
if
i
complete
my
case
theres
a
chance
youll
be
granted
sanctuary
right
now
youll
be
killed
on
sight
not
willing
to
risk
it
what
am
i
supposed
to
do
sit
here
and
wait
craven
may
still
have
his
men
with
him

youre
not
going
alone
youre
not
as
strong
as
you
might
think
what
michael

youre
unique
there
has
never
been
a
hybrid
before
however
ambivalent
you
are
about
it

the
truth
is
your
powers
may
be
limitless
you
depend
on
blood

you
need
to
feed
without
it
you
will
be
growing
weaker
by
the
second

use
the
time
for
that
jesus
christ
and
what
if
i
dont
or
if
i
cant
it
could
be
lethal
if
you
dont
anticipate
your
cravings

you
will
attack
humans
and
believe
me
you
dont
want
that
on
your
conscience
there
really
is
no
going
back
michael
look
i
understand
what
you
did

im
grateful
you
saved
my
life
i
wasnt
ready
to
die
everything
has
changed
i
probably
needed
a
minute
to
think
the
process
all
at
once
look

go

ill
be
here
just
make
sure
you
come
back
witness
has
been
silenced
but
otherwise
unharmed
as
ordered
show
me
what
you
have
yes
sir
death
dealers
we
killed

we
found
no
lycan
bodies
apparently
they
we
using
some
kind
of
new
ammunition

some
sort
of
uv
round
amelia
no
one
survived
it
seems
cravens
men
may
have
been
present
but
did
nothing
to
prevent
it
and
viktor
no
trace
of
markus
amongst
the
ashes
it
seems
he
has
destroyed
his
own
coven
it
was
never
his
coven
give
me
a
moment
how
ya
doing
michael
corvin
michael
here

take
it
no
michael
youll
die
can
you
move
markus
i
know
what
youve
done

selene
viktor
deserved
his
fate
craven
was
no
better
craven
has
already
reaped
the
rewards
of
his
own
misdeeds
and
viktor

he
deserved
his
fate
a
terrible
business
the
slaying
of
your
family
yet
so
much
effort
was
spent
to
conceal
this
from
me
what
do
you
suppose
viktor
had
to
hide
or
perhaps

it
is
you
selene
as
the
last
of
your
wretched
family
who
has
something
to
hide
dead
or
alive

you
will
give
me
what
i
want
hes
a
hybrid
isnt
he
yes
he
wanted
this
why
but
we
have
another
problem
turn
off
up
here
keep
your
foot
on
the
gas
and
stay
down
hold
on
give
me
your
hand
theres
really
no
need
be
right
back
let
me
see
no
need
area
secure
sir
the
sun
is
setting
whats
wrong
if
supplies
were
taken
used
weapons
were
left
behind
they
couldnt
have
gone
very
far
remain
airborne
for
the
moment
im
sure
they
will
reappear
yes
sir
ive
seen
this
before
when
i
was
a
child
ive
held
it
when
it
was
open
like
this
how
is
that
possible
but
i
know
someone
that
might
andreas
tanis

he
was
the
official
historian
of
the
covens
he
fell
from
favor
after
documenting
what
viktor
considered
malicious
lies
of
course
as
it
turns
out
hes
been
telling
the
truth
what
happened
to
him
he
was
exiled
over

years
ago
years
what
makes
you
think
were
going
to
find
him
now
i
was
the
one
who
exiled
him
looks
like
a
monastery
it
used
to
be

more
like
a
prison
now
tanis
has
been
hiding
there
since
viktors
order
were
the
most
people
hed
seen
in
centuries
thats
odd
what
i
dont
remember
this
gate
being
here
before
i
knew
it
was
you
selene
the
stench
of
viktors
blood
still
lingers
in
your
veins
tanis

i
see
your
aim
hasnt
improved
you
havent
changed
you
dont
scare
me
selene
well
were
going
to
have
to
work
on
that
we
need
to
talk
your
exile
seems
a
bit
more
comfortable
than
i
remember
how
does
a
vampire
have
lycan
bodyguards
a
gift
from
a
most
persuasive
client
lucian
why
would
lucian
want
to
protect
you
because
he
was
trading
with
them
uv
rounds

how
long
have
you
been
in
the
business
of
killing
your
own
kind
ive
done
whats
necessary
to
survive
my
decision
was
easy
once
your
precious
viktor
betrayed
me
betrayal
was
something
he
did
very
well
viktors
dead
i
killed
him
you
killed
viktor
no
i
think
not
oh
unless
youve
learned
the
truth
so
your
eyes
are
finally
open
aint
it
interesting
that
the
truth
is
even
harder
to
absorb
than
lies
you
know
i
tried
to
stop
him
of
course

a
travesty
committing
such
a
horrible
crime
and
then
turning
you
that
was
too
much
to
take
my
protest
as
to
why
he
put
me
here
careful
with
that
dear
makes
a
terrible
bang
open
the
blades
and
theyre
active
good
to
know
viktor
put
you
here
for
a
reason
but
i
doubt
its
because
you
had
moral
qualms
what
do
you
know
very
little
of
anything
im
afraid
oh

then
perhaps
i
may
be
mistaken

then
theres
no
use
for
you
at
all
markus
was
after
this
why
some
history
is
based
on
truth
and
others
on
deception
viktor
was
not
the
first
of
our
kind
as
you
were
led
to
believe
he
was
once
human

ruler
of
his
lands
markus

hes
the
one
the
source

the
first
true
vampire
so
the
legend
is
true
toward
the
end
of
his
ruthless
life
his
next
breath
meant
more
to
viktor
than
silver
or
gold
markus
came
with
an
offer

a
reprieve
from
sickness
and
death
immortality
in
return

viktor
was
to
use
his
army
turned
immortal
to
protect
him
to
do
what
to
defeat
the
very
first
werewolves
a
dangerous
and
very
infectious
breed
created
by
markuss
own
flesh
and
blood
his
twin
brother
william
but
these
werent
the
lycans
we
know
disgusting
as
your
brethren
may
be
they
at
least
are
evolved
no
these
were
raging
monsters
never
able
to
take
human
form
again
its
only
the
later
generations
that
learned
to
channel
their
rage
and
williams
appetite
for
destruction
and
rampage
was
insatiable
he
had
to
be
stopped

so
once
viktors
army
was
turned
the
legions
of
vampires
under
his
control
tracked
down
and
destroyed
the
animals
then
captured
william
and
locked
him
away
viktors
prisoner
for
all
time
why
let
him
live
for
the
same
reason
why
viktor
never
conspired
against
markus
he
was
warned
if
markus
should
ever
be
killed

all
those
in
his
blood
line
would
follow
him
to
the
grave
so
in
viktors
mind

williams
death
would
be
the
end
for
all
lycans
his
slaves
yes
a
clever
deception
but
one
viktor
was
hardly
willing
to
put
to
the
test
so
markus
was
protected

at
all
costs
ah
yes

here
we
are
vampires
mortals
men
loyal
to
alexander
corvinus
the
father
of
us
all
you
should
know

its
williams
prison
the
prison
your
father
was
commissioned
to
build
she
now
understands
why
her
family
was
killed
but
that
was
many
years
later
the
winter
of
lucians
escape

your
father
knew
too
much
or
too
much
for
viktor
to
risk
especially
when
lucian
had
the
key
to
williams
cell
and
im
the
map
the
only
one
still
living
who
has
seen
its
location
oh
viktor
realized
youd
be
too
young
to
remember
explicitly
is
hidden
away
in
your
blood
why
is
markus
looking
for
him
now
after
all
this
time
that
i
cannot
answer
but
i
do
know
someone
who
could
stop
him

perhaps
i
could
arrange
a
meeting
in
exchange
for
your
discretion
of
course
of
course
tanis

you
seem
anxious
why
do
you
flee
the
very
sight
of
me
please

sit
theres
no
need
for
this
to
be
unpleasant
i
always
rather
enjoyed
your
company
now
youre
being
rude
viktor
struck

keys

what
do
you
know
of
them
keys
i
dont
know
of
any
keys
oh
yes

those
keys
yes
one
was
kept
in
plain
sight
draped
around
his
daughters
neck
right
there
for
you
to
see
and
the
other
kept
with
viktor
at
all
times
where
within
him
beneath
the
flesh
perhaps
i
could
arrange
a
meeting
go
to
pier


ask
for
lorenz
macaro
how
do
you
know
hes
not
just
setting
us
up
hes
not
brave
enough
to
set
me
up
you
can
go
youre
familiar
with
this
then
intimately
you
are
alexander
corvinus
there
was
a
time
when
i
was
known
by
that
name
by
any
name
i
am
still
your
forefather
how
have
you
stayed
hidden
all
these
years
for
centuries
i
have
stood
by
and
watched
the
havoc
my
sons
have
brought
upon
each
other
and
upon
humanity
not
the
legacy
i
prayed
for
the
morning
i
watched
them
enter
this
world
and
a
tiresome
duty
keeping
the
war
contained

cleaning
up
the
mess
hiding
my
familys
unfortunate
history
couldnt
you
have
stopped
it
yes
could
you
kill
your
own
sons
you
know
what
markus
will
do
if
he
finds
me

he
finds
williams
prison
you
need
to
help
us
stop
him
you
are
asking
me
to
help
you
kill
my
son
you
a
death
dealer
how
many
innocents
did
killed
in
the

century
quest
to
avenge
your
family
and
even
less
noble
than
william
at
least
he
cannot
control
his
savagery
anything
ive
done
can
be
laid
at
your
feet
hundreds
of
thousands
have
died
because
of
your
inability
to
accept
that
you
sons
are
monsters
that
they
create
monsters
you
could
have
stopped
all
of
this
dont
come
groveling
to
me
simply
because
you
are
weaker
than
your
adversary
you
know
the
devastation
william
caused
before
he
was
captured
he
cannot
be
set
free
no

wait
youre
no
match
for
him
soon

michael
hello
father
you

unwelcomed

my
presence
ah

the
predictable
heart

that
never
thaws
pity
it
beats
within
such
a
fool
the
eldest
of
the
immortals
yet
you
have
made
no
attempt
to
seize
your
destiny
we
are
oddities
of
nature
you
and
i
nothing
more
this
is
a
world
for
humanity
and
that
petty
sentiment
explains
why
you
rejected
your
sons
why
you
stood
by
for
half
a
millennium
as
william
suffered
alone
in
darkness
no
father

i
have
no
sympathy
for
your
petty
sentiment
viktors
key
where
is
it
whatever
plan
you
have
for
william
is
futile

you
cannot
control
him
oh
i
am
stronger
now
and
our
bond
is
greater
than
youve
ever
wanted
to
acknowledge
youre
wrong

soon
youll
be
drowning
in
lycans
just
like
before

lycans

hybrid
before
you
powers
could
be
limitless
where
is
he
he
went
right
through
there
all
we
have
is
uv
rounds

it
wont
take
him
down
no

but
itll
slow
him
down
no
these
are
not
the
lycans
you
know
raging
monsters
unable
to
take
human
form
ever
again
what
are
you
waiting
for
shoot
em
i
cant

not
without
taking
her
out
i
cant
get
a
shot
take
him
down
i
knew
viktor
made
a
mistake
by
keeping
you
as
a
pet
he
should
have
killed
you
with
the
rest
of
you
family
an
unknown
chapter
lies
ahead
the
lines
that
have
divided
the
clans
has
now
been
blurred
chaos
and
infighting
are
inevitable
all
that
is
certain
is
that
darkness
is
still
ahead
but
for
now
for
the
first
time
speak
italian
weve
arrived

i
stopped
here
so
we
could
stretch
our
legs
its
a
marvelous
painting
i
cried
the
first
time
i
saw
it
this
light
reminds
me
of
the
autumn
in
moscow
come
on

i
dont
want
to
ill
wait
for
you
inside

i
dont
want
to
im
tired
of
seeing
these
sickeningly
beautiful
sights
l
want
nothing
more
just
for
myself
thats
enough
have
you
come
to
pray
for
a
baby
too
or
to
be
spared
them
im
just
looking
if
there
are
any
casual
onlookers
who
arent
supplicants
then
nothing
happens
what
is
supposed
to
happen
whatever
you
like

whatever
you
need
most
but
you
should
at
least
kneel
down
i
cant

theyre
used
to
it
theyre
used
to
it
they
have
faith

probably
can
i
ask
you
something
why
do
you
think
its
only
the
women
who
pray
so
much
youre
asking
me
you
see
so
many
women
here
im
only
the
sacristan
but
you
must
wonder
why
women
are
more
devout
than
men
you
should
know
because
youre
a
woman
no

ive
never
understood
these
things
im
a
simple
man
but
i
think
a
woman
is
meant
to
have
children
to
raise
them
with
patience
and
selfsacrifice
thats
all
shes
meant
for
i
dont
know

thank
you
youve
been
a
great
help
you
asked
what
i
thought
you
want
to
be
happy
there
are
more
important
things
pitiful
mother

merciful
mother
painful
mother

tormented

tarkovskys

good
poet
poetry

the
whole
of
art

may
be
right

poetry
is
untranslatable

machiavelli
dont
help
its
impossible
for
us

know
each
other

with
his
family
for

years
to
wait
for
the
end
of
the
world
a
religious
fit

they
say
nonsense
he
was
jealous
of
his
wife
later
she
ran
off
with
the
children
jealous
my
foot

hes
nuts
thats
not
it

he
was
just
scared
scared
of
what
everything
youre
wrong

hes
a
man
of
great
faith
and
how

he
kept
his
family
locked
up
for

years
when
they
broke
down
the
door
his
kid
shot
out
like
a
rat
and
he
chased
after
him
we
thought
he
wanted
to
kill
him
heres
the
russian
poet
miss

i
dont
smoke
but
could
i
have
a
cigarette
of
course

as
you
dont
smoke
its
gone
out

so
it
has
never
forget
what
he
said
to
her
and
her
saint
catherine
so
what
did
god
say
to
st

catherine
you
are
she
who
is
not
but
i
am
he
who
is
did
you
hear
that
bravo

domenico
did
he
speak
to
st

catherine
himself
dont
tease
him
domenico
has
a
degree
in
what
what
is
faith
even
your
ltalian
was
better
when
you
first
came
what
does
faith
mean
in
russian
its
vera
why
do
they
say
hes
mad
hes
not
mad

he
has
faith
there
are
lots
of
these
lunatics
at
large
in
ltaly
asylums
have
been
closed
down
but
the
families
wont
have
them
what
is
madness
theyre
troublesome

inconvenient
we
refuse
to
understand
them
theyre
alone
but
theyre
certainly
closer
to
the
truth
he
has
another
fixation
now
what
he
gets
into
the
pool
with
a
lighted
candle
everyones
afraid
he
wants
to
drown
himself
so
they
throw
him
out
and
save
him
i
dont
believe
it
ask
them
can
we
ask
him
to
have
lunch
with
us
when
now
now
you
dont
know
what
time
is
it
what
time
is
it
its

in
the
morning
in
the
morning
does
that
man
with
the
wet
shoes
come
often
it
depends

sometimes
he
does

sometimes
he
doesnt
where
does
he
live
up
above
bagno
vignoni
in
the
square
whats
so
funny

his
family

how
should
i
know
ive
brought
a
famous
russian
writer

we
hear
you

a
lovely
experience
i
read
about
it
too

in
the
papers
its
not
worth
it
maybe
not

but
this
gentleman
has
come
from
moscow

me
hes
come
a
long
way
what
did
he

bigger
drop

l
smoke
when
i
dont
know
what
to
say
i
ask
for
a
cigarette
too
but
i
never
learned
to
smoke
its
too
hard
you
have
to
learn
to
not
smoke

to
do
important
things
some
wine
we
need
bigger
ideas
what
i
was
selfish
i
wanted
to
save
my
family
everyone
must
be
saved

the
whole
world
how
its
simple
you
see
the
candle
why
do
you
say
all
right
youre
confusing
me
you
cross
the
water
with
the
lighted
candle
which
water
the
hot
water
st

catherines
pool
by
the
hotel
the
steaming
water
all
right

when
i
cant
do
it
when
i
light
the
candle
and
get
into
the
water
they
pull
me
out
they
kick
me
out
and
they
shout

i
kept
shaking
my
head
until

it
before

the
wardrobe
but
it
was
no
good
i
kept
just
missing
it

just
couldnt
squash
it

since
that
night
i

touching
my
hair

his
chinese
music
but
you
wont
drive
me
away
dear
pyotr
nikolayevich
ive
been
in
ltaly

years
very
important
ones
both
for
my
profession
and
for
my
everyday
life
last
night
i
had
a
bad
dream
i
had
to
stage
an
opera
in
the
theater
of
my
lord
the
count
the
first
act
was
set
in
a
park
full
of
statues
but
they
were
naked
men
forced
to
stand
motionless
and
i
was
a
statue
too
i
knew
i
would
be
harshly
punished
if
i
moved
because
our
lord
and
master
was
watching
us
i
could
feel
the
cold
rising
from
my
marble
pedestal
as
the
autumn
leaves
settled
on
my
upraised
arm
yet
i
stood
still
but
when
i
sensed
i
could
resist
no
longer
i
awoke
i
was
afraid
for
i
knew
it
had
been
no
dream
but
my
reality
yet
i
would
die
if
i
never
returned
to
russia
if
i
never
again
saw
my
homeland
the
birches

the
air
of
my
childhood
an
affectionate
greeting
from
your
abandoned
friend
pavel
sosnovsky
maria
as
a
child
i
fell
ill
from
hunger
and
fear
i
tear
shreds
of
skin
from
my
lips

in
my
memory
i
lick
traces
of
salt

of
freshness
and
still
i
walk
i
sit
on
a
doorstep

looking
for
warmth
i
stagger
deliriously
as
to
the
pipers
tune
i
was
hot

i
opened
my
collar
and
i
lay
down
the
trumpets
sounded

a
light
pierced
my
eyelids
high
above
the
pavement
mother
flies

beckons
with
her
hand
and
flies
away
now
beneath
the
appletrees

i
dream
of
a
white
hospital
as
a
child
i
fell
ill
i
must
go
and
see
dad
ive
a
jacket
in
the
wardrobe

its
been
there
three
years
ill
wear
it
again
when
im
home
in
moscow
i
never
go
anywhere

i
never
see
anyone
what
are
you
doing
here
dont
be
afraid
dont
be
afraid
of
me

its
i
who
should
be
afraid
of
you
you
could
shoot
me
everyone
shoots
in
ltaly
and
there
are
too
many
ltalian
shoes
dreadful
why
does
everyone
buy
them
these
are

years
old

its
not
important
you
know
of
great
romances
no
kisses
nothing
at
all

very
pure
hence
great
feelings
unspoken
feelings
are
unforgettable
here
its
like
in
russia
i
dont
know
why
i
dont
speak
ltalian
well
heres
a
story
a
man
saves
another
who
was
sinking
into
a
slimy
pond
thereby
risking
his
own
life
now
they
are
both
lying
on
the
edge
of
the
pound
out
of
breath

exhausted
the
rescued
man
says

idiot
why
did
you
do
that
i
live
in
there
he
was
offended
angela

good
girl
are
you
glad
about
life
good
girl
sight
grows
dim

my
strength
is
two
occult

adamantine
darts
hearing
weavers
for
my
fathers
house
breathes
distant
thunder
the
tissues
of
hard
muscles
weaken
like
hoary
oxen
at
the
plough
and
no
longer
when
night
falls
do
two
wings
gleam
behind
me
during
the
party

like
a
candle
i
wasted
away
gather
up
at
dawn
my
melted
wax
and
read
in
it

real
evil
of
our
time
the
hearts
path
is
covered
in
shadow

must
listen
to
the
voices
that
seem
useless
in
brains
full
of
long
sewage
pipes
of
school
wall

tarmac
and
welfare
papers
the
buzzing
of
insects
must
enter
we
must
fill
the
eyes
and
ears
of
all
of
us
with
things
that
are
the
beginning
of
a
great
dream
it
doesnt
matter
if
we
dont
we
must
fuel
that
wish
and
stretch
the
corners
of
the
soul
like
an
endless
sheet
if
you
want
the
world
to
go
forward
we
must
hold
hands
we
must
mix
the
socalled
healthy
with
the
socalled
sick
you
healthy
ones
what
does
your
health
mean
the
eyes
of
all
mankind
are
looking
at
the
pit
into
which
we
are
plunging
freedom
is
useless
if
you
dont
have
the
courage
to
look
us
in
the
eye
to
eat

drink
and
sleep
with
us
its
the
socalled
healthy
who
have
brought
the
world
to
the
verge
of
ruin
man

listen
in
you

water

fire
and
then
ashes
and
the
bones
in
the
ashes
the
bones
and
the
ashes
wait
for
me
in
the
car
where
am
i
when
im
not
in
reality
or
in
my
imagination
heres
my
new
pact
it
must
be
sunny
at
night
and
snowy
in
august
great
things
end
small
things
endure
society
must
become
united
again
instead
of
so
disjointed
just
look
at
nature
and
youll
see
that
life
is
simple
we
must
go
back
to
where
we
were
to
the
point
where
you
took
the
wrong
turn
we
must
go
back
to
the
main
foundations
of
life
without
dirtying
the
water
what
kind
of
world
is
this
if
a
madman
tells
you
you
must
be
ashamed
of
yourselves

just
living

my
man

little
nervous
but

a
little
temptress

though

you
hey

hey

thanks

lot

thanks
a
lot
hey

theres
the
big
daddy
matthew

what
has
been
going
on
with
you
some
serious
shit
but

jesus

man

its
good
to
see
you
will
you
excuse
us

please
oh

my
god

am
i
blowing
it
just
try
and
control
yourself
just
breathe

okay
all
right
i
have
learned
a
lot
from
my
teachers
but
my
best
teacher
has
always
been
my
mother
a
woman
who
worked
three
jobs
trying
to
support
me
ever
since
i
was
a
little
ni�a
i
will
never
forget
the
day
she
said
to
me
and
that
is
why
i
have
always
tried
to
answer
the
call
of
the
great
john
f

kennedy
who
urged
us
to
ask
not
what
your
country
lets
see
here
i
cant
speak
a
foreign
language
so
thats
out
and
l
i
certainly
cant
quote
jfk

now
can
i

ryan
you
know
what
its
funny

i
have
this
whole
speech
prepared
and
ive
been
practicing
for
weeks
but
you
know
what
im
just
gonna
go
with
it
moral
fiber
so

what
is
moral
fiber
i
mean
its
funny

i
used
to
think
it
was
always
telling
the
truth
you
know

basically
being
a
fucking
boy
scout
but
lately

ive
been
seeing
it
differently
now
i
think
that
moral
fibers
about
finding
that
one
thing
you
really
care
about
that
one
special
thing
that
means
more
to
you
than
anything
else
in
the
world
and
when
you
find
her
you
fight
for
her

you
risk
it
all
your
future

your
life
your
future

your
life
all
of
it
and
maybe
the
stuff
you
do
to
help
her
isnt
so
clean
you
know
what
it
doesnt
matter
because
in
your
heart
you
know
that
the
juice
is
worth
the
squeeze
thats
what
moral
fibers
all
about
first

id
just
like
to
commend
the
candidates
on
their
impressive
remarks
this
year
was
a
very
tough
decision
and
as
much
as
wed
love
to
give
you
all
scholarships

cant

proud
to

a
quiet
corner
i
am
sir
tes
head
servant
and
this
is
another
of
our
guests
its
heavy
for
such
a
thin
piece
of
metal
the
handle
is
heavy

and
the
blade
is
no
ordinary
metal
still

the
sword
is
the
lightest
of
weapons
youre
just
not
used
to
handling
it
but

i
have
had
much
practice
as
a
child
in
the
west

a
platoon
lived
with
us
theyd
let
me
play
with
their
weapons
the
scabbard
is
so
beautiful
beautiful
but
dangerous
once
you
see
it
tainted
with
blood

its
beauty
is
hard
to
admire
its

years
old
exquisite
you
said
it
belongs
to
my
friend
li
mu
bai

hes
given
it
to
sir
te
as
a
gift
li
mu
bai
the
famous
warrior
why
would
he
give
his
sword
to
sir
te
youre
too
young
to
understand
youre
a
sword
fighter
too
yes

i
am
but
i
prefer
the
machete
certain
moves

however

call
for
a
sword
it
must
be
exciting
to
be
a
fighter

to
be
totally
free
fighters
have
rules
too
friendship

trust
integrity
without
rules
we
wouldnt
survive
for
long
ive
read
all
about
people
like
you
roaming
wild

beating
up
anyone
who
gets
in
your
way
writers
wouldnt
sell
many
books
if
they
told
how
it
really
is
but
youre
just
like
the
characters
in
the
stories
sure

no
place
to
bathe
for
days

sleeping
in
fleainfested
beds
they
tell
you
all
about
that
in
those
books
you
know
what
i
mean
im
getting
married
soon

but
i
havent
lived
the
life
i
want
so
i
heard

the
most
important
step
in
a
womans
life

before
the
chin
era
engraved
with
a
technique
lost
by
the
time
of
the
han
dynasty

remarkable

point

the
imperial
court

the
problem
with
royalty

with
caution
in
your
quest
for
law

the
court

maybe
it

i
wouldnt

i
hear
your
wedding
day

near
you

i

the
better
my
parents

arranging
everything
the
gous
are
a
very
powerful
family
my
marrying
one
will
be
good
for
my

career
you

fortunate
to

into
such
a
noble
family
am
i
i
wish
i
were
like
the
heroes
in
the
books
i
read
like
you
and
li
mu
bai
i
guess
im
happy
to
be
marrying
but
to
be
free
to
live
my
own
life
to
choose
whom
i
love
that
is
true
happiness
do
you
think
so
let
me
tell
you
a
story
about
you
and
li
mu
bai
did
you
know
i
was
once
engaged
to
be
married
no

really
his
name
was
meng
si
zhao
he
was
a
brother
to
li
mu
bai
by
oath
one
day

while
in
battle
he
was
killed
by
the
sword
of
li
mu
bais
enemy
after

li
mu
bai
and
i
went
through
a
lot
together
our
feelings
for
each
other
grew
stronger
but
how
could
we
dishonor
mengs
memory
so
the
freedom
you
talk
about

i
too
desire
it
but
i
have
never
tasted
it
too
bad
for
meng

but
its
not
your
fault

or
li
mu
bais
i
am
not
an
aristocrat

as
you
are
but
i
must
still
respect
a
womans
duties
dont
distance
us
from
now
on

lets
be
like
sisters
then
as
a
sister

let
me
wish

my

now
its
time
for

to
pay
your
master
underestimated
us
women
sure

hed
sleep
with
me

but
he
would
never

he
deserved
to
die
by
a
womans
hand
you
stole
the
secrets
of
wudans
highest
martial
arts
but
after
ten
years
of
training
your
moves
are
still
undisciplined
and
today
under
a
wudan
sword
you
will
die
disciple

well

them
all
i
must
get
rid
of
tsai
why

the
green
destiny
in
your
possession

to
you
my

li
mu
bai
the
green
destiny
is
mine
jade
fox
cant
be
your
master
where
did
you
learn
that
xuan
piu
move
im
just
playing
around
tell
me

who
is
your
master
lets
go
we
must
kill
them
this
is
tsai
my
father
police
inspector
from
shaan
this
should
be
reported
to
governor
yu
the
victim
is
an
officer
you
believe
the
killer
is
hiding
out
in
his
compound
id
bet
my
life
on
it
this
needs
to
be
resolved

and
quickly
ill
get
into
the
yu
household
and
get
her
ill
ferret
out
fox
and
her
gang
we
must
be
careful
yu
is
a
court
official

and
in
charge
of
security
any
disturbance
will
cast
suspicion
on
him
it
might
get
sir
te
in
trouble
this
is
a
delicate
matter
sir
te

can
you
find
some
excuse
to
invite
madam
yu
and
her
daughter
what
do
you
have
in
mind
the
best
way
to
trap
a
fox
is
through
her
cubs
madam
te
is
certainly
spoiling
us
with
these
wedding
gifts
shes
being
so
considerate
im
sorry
shes
not
feeling
well
enough
to
receive
you
today
i
heard
sir
te
lost
something
and
now
madam
tes
not
feeling
well
we
know
who
stole
the
missing
item
if
the
thief
returns
it

im
sure
sir
te
will
pursue
the
matter
no
further
sometimes
the
help
cant
keep
their
hands
to
themselves
its
very
embarrassing
sir
te
knows
that
even
wellmeaning
people
can
make
mistakes
that
can
bring
ruin
to
themselves
and
their
families
but
dont
be
too
lenient
no
mercy
will
be
shown
toward
the
murderer
who
turned
up
in
peking
a
murderer
the
very
killer
of
li
mu
bais
own
master
last
night
she
killed
a
policeman
who
had
tracked
her
down
a
female
criminal
now
thats
news
you
say
she
killed
a
policeman
yes

from
the
west
he
went
undercover

and
followed
her
here
maybe
the
murderer
and
the
thief
are
the
same
i
doubt
that
this
thief
is
very
unusual
and
most
likely
smarter
than
a
mere
killer

is

my
disciple
you
think
youve
been
teaching
me
all
these
years
from
the
manual
you
couldnt
even
decipher
the
symbols
i
studied
the
diagrams
but
you
hid
the
details
you
wouldnt
have
understood

even
if
i
had
tried
to
explain
youve
gone
as
far
as
you
can
go
i
hid
my
skills
so
as
not
to
hurt
you
if
i
hadnt
seen
you
fight
with
li
mu
bai
id
still
be
ignorant
of
all
youve
hidden
from
me
i
started
learning
from
you
in
secret
when
i
was
you
enchanted
me
with
the
world
of
giang
hu
but
once
i
realized
i
could
surpass
you
i
became
so
frightened
everything
fell
apart
i
had
no
one
to
guide
me
no
one
to
learn
from
believe
me
ive
a
lesson
or
two
left
to
teach
you
the
sword
is
back
are
you
happy
i
admit
getting
it
back
makes
me
realize
how
much
id
missed
it
but
its
not
your
sword
anymore
you
gave
it
to
sir
te
but
i
must
borrow
it
for
one
last
mission
jade
fox
must
die
at
its
edge
did
you
know
what
you
were
hiding
when
you
covered
for
that
girl
my
job
was
to
get
the
sword
back

without
embarrassing
anyone
i
wasnt
about
to
ruin
her
life

or
her
fathers
you
did
your
job
well
but

this
girl
i
saw
her
last
night
i
knew
she
would
intrigue
you
she
needs
direction
and
training
shes
an
aristocrats
daughter

shes
not
one
of
us
in
any
case

it
will
all
be
over
soon
youll
kill
fox

and
shell
marry
thats
not
for
her
she
should
come
to
wudan
and
become
a
disciple
but
wudan
does
not
accept
women
for
her

they
might
make
an
exception
if
not

im
afraid
shell
become
a
poisoned
dragon
its
not
our
affair
even
if
wudan
accepts
her

her
husband
might
object
i
thought
by
giving
away
the
sword
i
could
escape
the
giang
hu
world
but
the
cycle
of
bloodshed
continues
i
wish
there
were
something
more
i
could
do
to
help
you

be
patient
with
me

shu
lien

you
shouldnt
have
come
with

the
traffic
on
your
rooftop
these
days
it
took
me
a
while
to
get
in
here
i
cant
wait
any
longer
i
was
wrong
to
let
you
go
come
back

youll
be

in
the
desert
youll
be

as
lightning

you
like
that
arrow

i
can
make
you
a
bow
great
for
hunting
wild
chicken
theyre
delicious
you
need
to
eat

understand
then
youll
have
the
strength
to
fight
youre
eating
too
fast
slowly
youve
got
quite
a
temper
its
better
this
way
you
coward
still
in
a
bad
mood
at
least
youre
speaking
i
didnt
think
the
hans
had
names
like
that
if
i
had
wanted
to

i
would
already
have
done
it
you
must
be
dying
for
a
bath
fresh
waters
hard
to
get
here
but
i
managed
to
bring
some
up
you
can
wear
my
clothes
when
youre
done
theyre
clean
ill
sing

so
youll
know
where
i
am
after
the
bath

youll
be
calmer
no
more
hitting
on
the
head
all
this
trouble
for
a
comb
its
mine
it
means
a
lot
to
me

a
barbarian
like
you
wouldnt
understand
not
true

i
can
use
it
to
pick
fleas
from
my
horse
by
the
way

im
a
real
manchurian
i
guessed
wrong
i
thought
you
were
a
han
i
dont
take
orders
from
anyone
one
night
when
i
was
a
boy

i
saw
a
thousand
shooting
stars
i
thought

where
did
they
all
go
im
an
orphan

i
used
to
look
for
stars
alone
i
thought
if
i
rode
to
the
other
end
of
the
desert

id
find
them
ive
been
riding
in
the
desert
ever
since
and
so

the
little
boy
became
a
fearsome
bandit
he
couldnt
find
the
stars

so
he
stole
my
comb
out
here

you
always
fight
for
survival
you
have
to
be
part
of
a
gang
to
stand
a
chance
slowly

your
gang
becomes
your
family
all
that
dark
cloud
stuff
is
just
to
scare
people
and
make
my
life
easier
so
you
are
still
that
little
boy
looking
for
shooting
stars
i
am
a
man
and
now
ive
found
the
brightest
star
of
all
your
fathers
men
are
looking
for
you
theyre
still
out
there

circling
closer
let
them
look
it
is
trouble
for
me
dont
send
me
back
you
must
decide
you
might
get
tired
of
this
life
you
might
begin
to
miss
your
family
if
it
were
our
daughter

wed
look
for
her
too
she
would
miss
us

a
word
ive
got
to
talk
to
you

pastor
ill
call

this
evening
in
case
you

please
have
a
seat
goodbye

mr

and
mrs

persson
you
wished
to
speak
to
me
actually

thats
not
the
whole
truth
actually

jonas
is
the
one
but
he
wont
talk
about
it
so
this
morning
i
decided
we
should
come
to
church
and
see
someone
you
see

were
feeling
so
lost
well

not
me
so
much
but
jonas
is
at
his
wits
end
could
you
talk
to
him

please
how
long
have
you
felt
troubled
it
started
last
spring

jonas
read
about
china
in
the
papers
the
article
said
the
chinese
people
were
brought
up
to
hate
and
that
its
only
a
matter
of
time
before
china
has
atom
bombs
they
have
nothing
to
lose

thats
what
they
wrote
it
doesnt
worry
me
all
that
much
maybe
im
just
short
on
imagination
but
jonas
cant
stop
thinking
about
it

and
so
we
discuss
it
constantly
though
i
cant
help
him
much
not
with
three
kids
and
one
on
the
way
everyone
feels
this
dread
to
some
extent
we
must
trust
god
we
live
our
simple
daily
lives
and
atrocities
shatter
the
security
of
our
world
its
so
overwhelming

and
god
seems
so
very
remote
i
feel
so
helpless
i
dont
know
what
to
say
i
understand
your
anguish
but
life
must
go
on
why
do
we
have
to
go
on
living
the
pastors
not
feeling
well

i
shouldnt
be
bothering
you
with
this
besides

were
powerless
to
do
anything
take
me
home
and
then
come
back

and
the
pastor

private

jonas

decisive

brandy

flu

fine

seeing
as
its
a
gift
from
you
would
you
like
me
to
stay

that
wont
be
necessary
you
have
a
lot
to
learn
says
the
schoolmarm
you
must
learn
to
love
and
you
can
teach
me
that
i
cant
thats
not
in
my
power
he
has
to
show
up
my
love
we
find
it
difficult
to
talk
to
each
other
were
both
rather
shy
and
i
tend
to
retreat
into
sarcasm
thats
why
im
writing
i
have
something
important
to
say
do
you
remember
last
summer
when
that
awful
rash
broke
out
on
my
hands
one
evening
we
were
in
church
arranging
flowers
on
the
altar
preparing
for
a
confirmation
do
you
recall
what
bad
shape
i
was
in
my
hands
all
bandaged

and
itching
so
much
i
couldnt
sleep
the
skin
had
flaked
off

and
my
palms
were
like
open
sores
we
busied
ourselves
with
daisies
and
cornflowers

or
whatever
they
were
and
i
was
feeling
irritable
suddenly
i
got
mad
at
you
and
challenged
you
angrily
asking
if
you
actually
believed
in
the
power
of
prayer
you
replied
that
you
did
in
a
nasty
tone
i
asked
if
you
had
prayed
for
my
hands
but
it
hadnt
occurred
to
you
to
do
so
i
melodramatically
demanded
that
you
do
it
then
and
there
oddly
enough

you
agreed
your
compliance
enraged
me

and
i
tore
off
the
bandages
you
remember
the
rest
the
sight
of
those
open
sores
affected
you
greatly
you
couldnt
pray
the
entire
situation
disgusted
you
i
came
to
understand
you
later
but
you
never
understood
me
we
had
lived
together
for
some
time
at
that
point
almost
two
years
which
at
least
represented
some
capital
in
the
face
of
our
emotional
poverty
our
caresses
and
our
clumsy
attempts
to
evade
the
lack
of
love
between
us
when
the
rash
spread
to
my
forehead
and
scalp
i
soon
noticed
how
you
avoided
me
you
found
me
repugnant
though
you
tried
to
spare
my
feelings
then
the
rash
spread
to
my
hands
and
feet
and
our
relationship
ended
that
came
as
a
shock
to
me
i
had
to
face
the
fact
that
we
didnt
love
each
other
there
was
no
way
to
hide
from
that
fact
or
turn
a
blind
eye
to
it
i
have
never
believed
in
your
faith
mainly
because
ive
never
been
tortured
by
religious
tribulations
my
nonchristian
family
was
characterized
by
warmth
togetherness
and
joy
god
and
jesus
existed
only
as
vague
notions
to
me
your
faith
seems
obscure
and
neurotic
somehow
cruelly
overwrought
with
emotion

primitive
one
thing
in
particular
ive
never
been
able
to
fathom
your
peculiar
indifference
to
jesus
christ
and
now
im
going
to
tell
you
about
answered
prayers
laugh
if
you
feel
like
it
personally

i
dont
believe
the
two
are
connected
life
is
messy
enough
without
taking
the
supernatural
into
account
you
were
going
to
pray
for
my
weeping
hands
but
the
rash
left
you
dumbstruck
with
repulsion
something
you
later
denied
i
went
berserk
and
tried
to
provoke
you
be
quiet
since
you
cant
pray
for
me

ill
do
it
myself
god

why
have
you
created
me
so
eternally
dissatisfied
so
frightened

so
bitter
why
must
i
realize
how
wretched
i
am
why
must
i
suffer
so
hellishly
for
my
insignificance
if
there
is
a
purpose
to
my
suffering

then
tell
me
so
i
can
bear
my
pain
without
complaint
im
strong
you
made
me
so
very
strong
in
both
body
and
soul
but
you
never
give
me
a
task
worthy
of
my
strength
give
my
life
meaning
and
ill
be
your
obedient
slave
this
autumn
i
realized
that
my
prayers
had
been
answered
i
prayed
for
clarity
of
mind

and
i
got
it
i
realized
that
i
love
you
i
prayed
for
a
task
to
apply
my
strength
to
and
i
received
one
that
task
is
you
this
is
what
the
thoughts
of
a
schoolmarm
might
run
to
when
the
phone
refuses
to
ring

when
its
dark
and
lonely
what
i
lack
entirely
is
the
capacity
to
show
you
my
love
i
havent
a
clue
how
to
do
that
ive
been
so
miserable

ive
even
considered
praying
some
more
but
i
still
have
a
shred
of
selfrespect
left
in
spite
of
it
all
my
dearest
tomas
this
turned
out
to
be
a
long
letter
but
now
ive
put
down
in
writing
what
i
never
dared
say
when
you
were
in
my
arms
and
i
live
for
you
take
me
and
use
me
beneath
all
my
false
pride
and
independent
airs
i
have
only
one
wish
to
be
allowed
to
live
for
someone
else
its
so
terribly
difficult
when
i
think
about
it
i
cant
see
how
i
will
be
able
to
pull
it
off
maybe
its
all
just
a
mistake
tell
me
im
not
wrong

darling
im
so
glad
you
came

its
been
a
long
wait
im
sorry
im
late
i
didnt
mean
it
as
a
reproach
please

take
your
coat
off

ive
got
some
nice
hot
coffee
i
dont
expect
you
spend
much
time
at
sea
this
time
of
year
we
just
take
short
fishing
trips

thats
all
plenty
to
do
ashore
yes

im
building
a
new
boat
over
at
t�rnstr�ms
yard
an
excellent
establishment
i
had
my
own
boat
built
there
at
t�rnstr�ms
yard
do
you
have
money
worries
forgive
me
for
asking

but
things
like
that
can
drive
a
man
to
despair
how
long
have
you
considered
taking
your
own
life
a
long
time
have
you
spoken
to
a
doctor
i
mean

are
you
in
good
health
as
far
as
i
know
its
not
unusual
to
do
you
get
along
with
your
wife
karins
all
right

shes
all
right
so
it
all
boils
down
to
this
business
about
china
listen

jonas
im
going
to
be
frank
with
you
you
know
my
wife
died
four
years
ago
i
loved
her
my
life
was
over
im
not
afraid
to
die
and
there
was
no
reason
for
me
to
hang
on
but
i
did
not
for
my
own
sake

but
to
be
of
some
use
i
had
great
dreams
once
i
was
going
to
make
my
mark
on
the
world
the
sort
of
ideas
you
have
when
youre
young
i
knew
nothing
of
evil
or
cruelty
when
i
was
ordained

i
was
as
innocent
as
a
baby
then
everything
happened
at
once
i
was
a
seamans
pastor
in
lisbon
during
the
spanish
civil
war
i
refused
to
see
what
was
going
on
i
refused
to
accept
reality
my
god
and
i
resided
in
an
organized
world
where
everything
made
sense
im
no
good
as
a
clergyman
i
put
my
faith
in
an
improbable
and
private
image
of
a
fatherly
god
one
who
loved
mankind

of
course
but
me
most
of
all
do
you
see

jonas

what
a
monstrous
mistake
i
made
an
ignorant

spoiled
and
anxious
wretch
makes
a
rotten
clergyman
picture
my
prayers
to
an
echogod
who
gave
benign
answers
and
reassuring
blessings
every
time
i
confronted
god
with
the
realities
i
witnessed
he
turned
into
something
ugly
and
revolting
a
spider
god

a
monster
so
i
sought
to
shield
him
from
life
clutching
my
image
of
him
to
myself
in
the
dark
the
only
person
i
showed
my
god
to
was
my
wife
she
supported
me

encouraged
me
and
helped
me
patched
up
the
holes
our
dreams
id
better
be
going
no

dont
go
i
want
you
to
understand
why
i
talk
so
much
about
myself
so
you
realize
what
a
wretch
i
am

what
a
poor
beggar
i
must
be
going

or
karin
will
be
worried
please
stay
a
little
bit
longer
lets
have
a
nice

calm
discussion
forgive
me
for
talking
in
such
a
confused
manner
but
all
this
suddenly
hit
me
if
there
is
no
god
would
it
really
make
any
difference
life
would
become
understandable
what
a
relief
and
thus
death
would
be
a
snuffing
out
of
life
the
dissolution
of
body
and
soul
cruelty

loneliness
and
fear
all
these
things
would
be
straightforward
and
transparent
suffering
is
incomprehensible

so
it
needs
no
explanation
there
is
no
creator
no
sustainer
of
life
no
design
now
im
free
free
at
last
i
had
this
fleeting
hope

auntie
arrived
wellstocked
cant
i
come
to
frostn�s
with
you
im
going
to
the
perssons
place
i
can
wait
in
the
car
i
thought
your
aunt
baked
a
cake
are
you
trying
to
get
rid
of
me
dont
do
this
right
now
i
dont
have
the
strength
why
do
you
want
to
get
rid
of
me
my
dear
little
tomas

youre
getting
old
youre
dissatisfied
with
life

but
most
of
all
with
yourself
and
here
i
am
throwing
myself
in
your
arms

clouding
the
issue
or
am
i
forcing
it
you
be
the
judge
you
have
your
dreams

and
i
pay
no
attention
to
them
at
times
i
even
despise
them
i
should
have
been
kinder
those
are
just
trivialities

no

theyre
not
youve
been
unlucky
im
so
very
bossy

dont
bother
contradicting
me
could
you
just
listen
to
me
sorry

im
doing
all
the
talking
i
feel
humiliated
by
the
gossip
no
one
used
to
pay
much
attention
to
the
pastor
he
was
simply
a
fixture
though
no
one
knew
exactly
what
he
was
good
for
then
the
rumors
began
about
you
and
me
all
that
tittletattle
so
thats
your
reason
you
dont
have
to
sneer
at
me
marry
me

then
its
hard
to
plead
ones
own
cause
yes

it
certainly
is
you
cant
you
mustnt
push
me
away
how
can
you
be
so
blind
dont
get
hysterical
thats
what
you
always
say
whenever
you
see
me
crying
i
suppose
i
am
a
tad
hysterical
calm
down

dont
alarm
your
aunt
i
cant
hold
back
the
tears
just
go
on
talking

i
can
still
hear
your
every
word
i
thought
id
found
a
good
excuse
all
that
stuff
about
a
pastors
reputation
but
you
didnt
bite
and
i
understand
that
since
it
was
a
pack
of
lies
the
real
reason
is
that
i
dont
want
you
of
course
i
did
im
tired
of
your
loving
care
your
fussing
your
good
advice
your
candlesticks
and
table
runners
im
fed
up
with
your
shortsightedness
your
clumsy
hands
your
anxiousness
your
timid
displays
of
affection
you
force
me
to
occupy
myself
with
your
physical
condition
your
poor
digestion
your
rashes
your
periods
your
frostbitten
cheeks
once
and
for
all
i
have
to
escape
this
junkyard
of
idiotic
trivialities
im
sick
and
tired
of
it
all
of
everything
to
do
with
you
why
didnt
you
tell
me
this
before
because
of
my
upbringing
i
was
taught
to
regard
women
as
beings
of
a
higher
order
admirable
creatures
unassailable
martyrs
and
your
wife
you
hear
me
i
loved
her
and
i
dont
love
you

because
i
love
my
wife
when
she
died

so
did
i
i
couldnt
care
less
what
happens
to
me
am
i
making
myself
clear
i
loved
her

and
she
was
everything
you
could
never
be
but
insist
on
trying
to
be
the
way
you
mimic
her
behavior
is
such
an
ugly
parody
i
didnt
even
know
her
before
i
spout
even
worse
bits
of
senseless
drivel
could
it
get
any
worse
stop
rubbing
your
eyes
like
that
stare
all
you
like
i
can
take
it
i
can
barely
see
you
without
my
glasses
youre
all
fuzzy
and
your
face
is
just
a
white
blob
youre
not
really
real
yes

i
see
that
i
did
it
all
wrong
from
the
beginning
ive
got
to
go

i
have
to
talk
to
mrs

persson
every
time
ive
hated
you
ive
made
an
effort
to
turn
it
into
compassion
you
cant
make
it
on
your
own
you
wont
survive

tomas
dear
nothing
can
save
you
youll
hate
yourself
to
death
cant
you
be
quiet
cant
you
leave
me
alone
cant
you
just
shut
up
would
you
like
to
come
along
do
you
really
want
me
to
or
is
that
fear
talking
suit
yourself

but
im
asking
you
to
come
of
course
ill
come
i
dont
have
much
choice

do
i
auntie

ill
be
back
by
she
must
be
asleep

ill
just
go
check
the
stove
your
husband
is
dead

mrs

persson
theyve
taken
him
to
the
infirmary

but
theres
no
hope
he
shot
himself
so

im
all
alone
shall
we
read
from
the
bible
together
ive
got
to
let
the
children
know
ill
be
in
all
evening

if
theres
anything
i
can
do
for
you
ill
come
by
sometime
this
week
to
make
funeral
arrangements
i
spoke
to
him

but
there
was
so
little
i
could
do
im
sure
you
did
what
you
could

sir
it
was
my
parents
dream
that
i
become
a
clergyman
those
bells
rang
for

seconds
too
long
unfortunately

i
was
busy
replacing
the
candles
i
usually
turn
on
the
bells

light
the
candles
and
make
it
back
in
time
but
today
i
bungled
it

an
unfortunate
mishap
but
those
candles
were
tricky
to
light
probably
a
factory
defect
and
i
guess
my
brokendown
body
is
slowing
down
my
actions
the
reason
hardly
matters
i
leave
the
temple
in
semidarkness
until
just
before
the
bells
start
i
believe
electric
lights
disturb
our
spirit
of
reverence
dont
you
agree

miss
lundberg
you
asked
to
have
a
word
with
me
yes

about
a
rather
urgent
matter
once

when
i
complained
about
my
pains
keeping
me
up
nights
you
suggested
that
i
read
i
remember
to
distract
myself
i
began
with
the
gospels
and
real
sleeping
potions
they
were
too

if
i
may
say
so
at
least
now
and
then
now
ive
got
as
far
as
the
story
of
christs
passion
and
its
given
me
pause
so
i
figured
id
discuss
it
with
you

pastor
ericsson
i
feel
compelled
to
do
so
the
passion
of
christ

his
suffering
wouldnt
you
say
the
focus
on
his
suffering
is
all
wrong
this
emphasis
on
physical
pain
it
couldnt
have
been
all
that
bad
it
may
sound
presumptuous
of
me
but
in
my
humble
way
ive
suffered
as
much
physical
pain
as
jesus
and
his
torments
were
rather
brief
lasting
some
four
hours

i
gather
i
feel
he
was
tormented
far
worse
on
another
level
maybe
ive
got
it
all
wrong
but
just
think
of
gethsemane

pastor
christs
disciples
fell
asleep
they
hadnt
understood
the
meaning
of
the
last
supper
or
anything
and
when
the
servants
of
the
law
appeared

they
ran
away
and
peter
denied
him
christ
had
known
his
disciples
for
three
years
theyd
lived
together
day
in
and
day
out
but
they
never
grasped
what
he
meant
they
abandoned
him

down
to
the
last
man
he
was
left
all
alone
that
must
have
been
painful
to
realize
that
no
one
understands
to
be
abandoned
when
you
need
someone
to
rely
on
that
must
be
excruciatingly
painful
but
the
worst
was
yet
to
come
when
jesus
was
nailed
to
the
cross
and
hung
there
in
torment

he
cried
out
god

my
god
why
hast
thou
forsaken
me
he
cried
out
as
loud
as
he
could
he
thought
that
his
heavenly
father
had
abandoned
him
he
believed
everything
hed
ever
preached
was
a
lie
in
the
moments
before
he
died

christ
was
seized
by
doubt
surely
that
must
have
been
his
greatest
hardship
gods
silence
no
service
today

not
a
soul
turned
up
you
dont
count
you
belong

so
to
speak

in
the
sheep
pen
so

how
are
you
doing
that
pastor
youre
running
after
isnt
worth
much
dont
deny
it
you
dont
think
a
spinster
can
be
choosy
m�rta

for
your
own
sake
you
can
leave
this
place

so
get
out
as
quickly
as
you
can
everything
at
mittsunda
and
frostn�s
is
in
the
grip
of
death
and
decay
take
me

for
instance
remember
when
i
used
to
arrange
musical
soirees
on
that
pile
of
junk
upstairs
i
gave
concerts
and
the
things
tomas
achieved
people
actually
attended
church
but
his
wife
was
his
undoing
that
got
your
attention

didnt
it
the
little
woman
my
old
galoshes
knew
human
nature
better
than
tomas
did
he
only
had
eyes
for
her
he
was
utterly
smitten
so
much
for
their
love
story
god
is
love
and
love
is
god
love
proves
the
existence
of
god
love
is
a
real
force
for
mankind
you
see

i
know
the
drill
ive
been
an
attentive
listener
to
the
pastors
outpourings
byebye

you
old
turtledove
get

lundberg

there
guess
i
shouldnt
say
only
its
time
to
start
the
service
bell
that
usually
brings
them
in
if
only
we
could
feel
safe
and
dare
show
each
other
tenderness
if
only
we
had
some
truth
to
believe
in
if
only
we
could
believe
shall
we
have
the
service

then
holy

holy

holy

the
lord
of

pass
gandalf
i
am
a
servant
of
the
secret
fire

wielder
of
the
flame
of
anor
go
back
to
the
shadow
the
dark
fire

not
avall
you

flame
of
ud�n
you

not
pass
gandalf

bogs
and
rope

and
goodness
knows
what
its
not
natural

none
of
it
whats
in
this
nothing
just
a
bit
of
seasoning

thought
maybe
if
we
was
having
a
roast
chicken
one
night
or
something
roast
chicken
you
never
know
sam

my
dear
sam
its

this
here

follow
us
down
whos

from
the

signed
it
this
morning
keep
breathing

thats
the
key
theyve
run
as
if
the
very
whips
of
their
masters
were
behind
them
were
not
going
no
further
until
weve
had
a
breather
get
a
fire
going
i
think
we
might
have
made
a
mistake
leaving
the
shire

pippin
whats
making
that
noise
its
the
trees
you
remember
the
old
forest

on
the
borders
of
buckland
folk
used
to
say
there
was
something
in
the
water
that
made
the
trees
grow
tall
and
come
alive
alive
trees
that
could
whisper
talk
to
each
other
even
move
im
starving
we
aint
had
nothing
but
maggoty
bread
for
three
stinking
days
why
cant
we

some
meat

something

an
elvish
weapon
the
master
wants
it
for
the
war
they
think
we
have
the
ring
as
soon
as
they
find
out
we
dont

were
dead

mouthful
a
bit
of
the

those
loyal
to

and
for
that

strange
tracks

air

so
close

this
forest
is
old
full
of
memory
and
anger
the
trees
are
speaking
to
each
other
gimli
lower
your
ax
they
have
feelings

my
friend
the
elves
began
it
waking
up
the
trees

teaching
them
to
speak
talking
trees
what
do
trees
have
to
talk
about
except
the
consistency
of
squirrel
droppings
the
white
wizard
approaches
do
not
let
him
speak

he
will
put
a
spell
on
us
we
must
be
quick
you
are
tracking
the
footsteps
of
two
young
hobbits
where
are
they
they
passed
this
way
the
day
before
yesterday
they
met
someone
they
did
not
expect
does
that
comfort
you
show
yourself
i
mistook
you
for
saruman
i
am
saruman
or
rather

saruman
as
he
should
have
been
you
fell
through
fire
and
water
from
the
lowest
dungeon
to
the
hlghest
peak
i
fought
wlth
the
balrog
of
morgoth
u
ntll
at
last
i
threw
down
my
enemy
and
smote
hls
ruln
upon
the
mountalnslde
darkness
took
me
and
i
strayed
out
of
thought
and
tlme
stars
wheeled
overhead
and
every
day
was
as
long
as
a
ilfe
age
of
the
earth
but
it
was
not
the
end
i
felt
ilfe
in
me
agaln
ive
been
sent
back
until
my
task
is
done
that
was
what
they
used
to
call
me
gandalf
the
grey
that
was
my
name
i
am
gandalf
the
white
and
i
come
back
to
you
now
at
the
turn
of
the
tide
one
stage
of
your
journey
is
over

another
begins
we
must
travel
to
edoras
with
all
speed

edoras
that
is
no
short
distance
we
hear
of
trouble
in
rohan

it
goes
ill
with
the
king
yes

and
it
will
not
be
easily
cured
then
we
have
run
all
this
way
for
nothing
are
we
to
leave
those
poor
hobbits
here
in
this
horrid

dark

dank
treeinfested
i
mean

charming
quite
charming
forest
it
was
more
than
mere
chance
that
brought
merry
and
pippin
to
fangorn
a
great
power
has
been
sleeping
here
for
many
long
years
the
coming
of
merry
and
pippin
will
be
like
the
falling
of
small
stones
that
starts
an
avalanche
in
the
mountains
i
n
one
thing
you
have
not
changed

dear
friend
you
still
speak
in
riddles
a
thing
is
about
to
happen
that
has
not
happened
since
the
elder
days
the
ents
are
going
to
wake
up
and
find
that
they
are
strong

strong
oh

thats
good
so
stop
your
fretting

master
dwarf
merry
and
pippin
are
quite
safe
i
n
fact

they
are
far
safer
than
you
are
about
to
be
this
new
gandalfs
more
grumpy
than
the
old
one
that
is
one
of
the
mearas
unless
my
eyes
are
cheated
by
some
spell
shadowfax
he
is
the
lord
of
all
horses
and
has
been
my
friend
through
many
dangers
o
rowan
mlne
i
saw
you
shlne
u
pon
a
summers
day
u
pon
your
head
how
goldenred
the
crown
you
bore
aloft
such
a
beautiful
verse
is
it
much
further
brurahroom

dont
be
hasty
you
might
call
it
far

perhaps
my
home
lies
deep
in
the
forest
near
the
roots
of
the
mountain
i
told
gandalf
i
would
keep
you
safe
and
safe
is
where
ill
keep
you
i
believe
you
will
enjoy
this
next
one
too
its
one
of
my
own
compositions
beneath
the
roof
of
sleeplng
leaves
and
the
dreams
of
trees
unfold
when
woodland
halls
are
green
and
cool
and
the
wlnd
is
in
the
west
come
back
to
me
come
back
to
me
and
say
my
land
is
best
sleep

little
shirelings
heed
no
nightly
noise
sleep
till
morning
light
i
have
business
in
the
forest
there
are
many
to
call

many
that
must
come
the
shadow
lies
on
fangorn
the
withering
of
all
woods
is
drawing
near
the
veiling
shadow
that
glowers
in
the
east
takes
shape
sauron
will
suffer
no
rival
from
the
summit
of
baradd�r

his
eye
watches
ceaselessly
but
he
is
not
so
mighty
yet
that
he
is
above
fear
doubt
ever
gnaws
at
him
the
rumor
has
reached
him
the
heir
of
n�menor
still
lives
sauron
fears
you

aragorn
he
fears
what
you
may
become
and
so
hell
strike
hard
and
fast
at
the
world
of
men
he
will
use
his
puppet
saruman
to
destroy
rohan
war
is
coming
rohan
must
defend
itself

and
therein
lies
our
first
challenge
for
rohan
is
weak
and
ready
to
fall
the
kings
mind
is
enslaved

its
an
old
device
of
sarumans
his
hold
over
king
th�oden
is
now
very
strong
sauron
and
saruman
are
tightening
the
noose
but
for
all
their
cunning
we
have
one
advantage
the
ring
remains
hidden
and
that
we
should
seek
to
destroy
it
has
not
yet
entered
their
darkest
dreams
in
the
hands
of
a
hobbit
each
day
brings
it
closer
to
the
fires
of
mount
doom
we
must
trust
now
in
frodo
everything
depends
upon
speed
and
the
secrecy
of
his
quest
do
not
regret
your
decision
to
leave
him
frodo
must
finish
this
task
alone
hes
not
alone
sam
went
with
him
did
he

indeed
good
yes

very
good
the
black
gate
of
mordor
oh

save
us
master
says
to
show
him
the
way
into
mordor
so
good
sm�agol
does

master
says
so
thats
it

then
we
cant
get
past
that
the
gate
its
opening
i
can
see
a
way
down
sam

no
i
do
not
ask
you
to
come
with
me

sam

i
know

mr

frodo
i
doubt
even
these
elvish
cloaks
will
hide
us
in
there
now
no
no
no

master
they
catch
you
they
catch
you
dont
take
it
to
him
he
wants
the
precious
always
he
is
looking
for
it
and
the
precious
is
wanting
to
go
back
to
him
but
we
mustnt
let
him
have
it
no
theres
another
way
more
secret

a
dark
way
why
havent
you
spoken
of
this
before
because
master
did
not
ask
hes
up
to
something
are
you
saying
theres
another
way
into
mordor
yes

theres
a
path
and
some
stairs
and
then
a
tunnel
hes
led
us
this
far

sam
mr

frodo

no
hes
been
true
to
his
word
lead
the
way

deserted
you
leave
me
alone

snake
oh

but
you
are
alone
who
knows
what
youve
spoken
to
the
darkness
in
the
bitter
watches
of
the
night
when
all
your
life
seems
to
shrink
the
walls
of
your
bower
closing
in
about
you
a
hutch
to
trammel
some
wild
thing
in
so
fair
so
cold
like
a
morning
of
pale
spring
still
clinging
to
winters
chill
your
words
are
poison
youll
find
more
cheer
in
a
graveyard
i
cannot
allow
you
before
th�oden
king
so
armed

gandalf
greyhame
by
order
of
gr�ma
wormtongue
your
staff
you
would
not
part
an
old
man
from
his
walking
stick
my
lord

gandalf
the
grey
is
coming
hes
a
herald
of
woe
the
courtesy
of
your
hall
is
somewhat
lessened
of
late
th�oden
king
hes
not
welcome
why
should
i
welcome
you
gandalf
stormcrow
a
just
question

my
liege
late
is
the
hour
in
which
this
conjurer
chooses
to
appear
l�thspell
i
name
him
ill
news
is
an
ill
guest
be
silent

keep
your
forked
tongue
behind
your
teeth
i
have
not
passed
through
fire
and
death
to
bandy
crooked
words
with
a
witless
worm
his
staff
i
told
you
to
take
the
wizards
staff
th�oden
son
of
thengel
too
long
have
you
sat
in
the
shadows
i
would
stay
still
if
i
were
you
i
release
you
from
the
spell
you
have
no
power
here
i
will
draw
you

saruman

as
poison
is
drawn
from
a
wound
if
i
go

th�oden
dies
you
did
not
kill
me
you
will
not
kill
him
rohan
is
mine
i
know
your
face
�owyn
breathe
the
free
air
again

my
friend
dark
have
been
my
dreams
of
late
your
fingers
would
remember
their
old
strength
better
if
they
grasped
your
sword
ever
served
you

my
lord
your
leechcraft
would
have
had
me
crawling
on
all
fours
like
a
beast
send
me
not
from
your
sight
no

my
lord
no

my
lord
let
him
go
enough
blood
has
been
spilt
on
his
account
get
out
of
my
way
hail

th�oden
king
where
is
th�odred
where
is
my
son
simbelmyn�
ever
has
it
grown
on
the
tombs
of
my
forebearers
now
it
shall
cover
the
grave
of
my
son
alas
that
these
evil
days
should
be
mine
the
young
perish
and
the
old
linger
that
i
should
live
to
see
the
last
days
of
my
house
th�odreds
death
was
not
of
your
making
no
parent
should
have
to
bury
their
child
he
was
strong
in
life
his
spirit
will
find
its
way
to
the
halls
of
your
fathers
they
had
no
warning
they
were
unarmed
now
the
wild
men
are
moving
through
the
westfold

burning
as
they
go
rick

cot
and
tree
where
is
mama
this
is
but
a
taste
of
the
terror
that
saruman
will
unleash
all
the
more
potent
for
he
is
driven
now
by
fear
of
sauron
ride
out
and
meet
him
head
on
draw
him
away
from
your
women
and
children
you
must
fight
you
have

good
men
riding
north
as
we
speak
�omer
is
loyal
to
you
his
men
will
return
and
fight
for
their
king
they
will
be

leagues
from
here
by
now
i
know
what
it
is
you
want
of
me
but
i
will
not
bring
further
death
to
my
people
i
will
not
risk
open
war
open
war
is
upon
you

whether
you
would
risk
it
or
not
when
last
i
looked
th�oden

not
aragorn

was
king
of
rohan
then
what
is
the
kings
decision
by
order
of
the
klng
the
city
must
empty
we
make
for
the
refuge
of
helms
deep
do
not
burden
yourself
with
treasures

take
only
what
provisions
you
need
helms
deep
they
flee
to
the
mountains
when
they
should
stand
and
fight
who
will
defend
them
if
not
their
king
hes
only
doing
what
he
thinks
is
best
for
his
people
helms
deep
has
saved
them
in
the
past
there
is
no
way
out
of
that
ravine

th�oden
is
walking
into
a
trap
he
thinks
hes
leading
them
to
safety
what
they
will
get
is
a
massacre
th�oden
has
a
strong
will

but
i
fear
for
him
i
fear
for
the
survival
of
rohan
he
will
need
you
before
the
end

aragorn
the
people
of
rohan
will
need
you
the
defenses
have
to
hold
they
will
hold
the
grey
pilgrim
thats
what
they
used
to
call
me
three
hundred
lives
of
men
ive
walked
this
earth

and
now
i
have
no
time
with
luck

my
search
will
not
be
in
vain
look
to
my
coming
at
first
light
on
the
fifth
day
at
dawn

look
to
the
east
that
horse
is
half
mad

my
lord

theres
nothing
you
can
do

leave
him
his
name
is
brego
he
was
my
cousins
horse
brego
i
have
heard
of
the
magic
of
elves
but
i
did
not
look
for
it
in
a
ranger
from
the
north
you
speak
as
one
of
their
own
i
was
raised
in
rivendell
for
a
time
turn
this
fellow
free
hes
seen
enough
of
war
gandalf
the
white
gandalf
the
fool
does
he
seek
to
humble
me
with
his
newfound
piety
there
were
three
who
followed
the
wizard
an
elf

a
dwarf
and
a
man
you
stink
of
horse
the
man
was
he
from
gondor
no

from
the
north
one
of
the
d�nedain
rangers

i
thought
he
was
his
cloth
was
poor
and
yet
he
bore
a
strange
ring
two
serpents
with
emerald
eyes
one
devouring

the
other
crowned
with
golden
flowers
the
ring
of
barahir
so
gandalf
greyhame
thinks
he
has
found
isildurs
heir
the
lost
king
of
gondor

he
is
a
fool
the
line
was
broken
years
ago
the
world
of
men
shall
fall
it
will
begin
at
edoras
i
am
ready

gamling

my
horse

is
not
a
defeat
we
will
return
you
have
some
skill
with
a
blade
women
of
this
country
learned
long
ago
those
without
swords
can
still
die
upon
them
i
fear
neither
death
nor
pain
what
do
you
fear

my
lady
a
cage
to
stay
behind
bars
until
use
and
old
age

them
and
all
chance
of
valor
has
gone
beyond
recall
or
desire
youre
a
daughter
of
kings

shieldmaiden
of
rohan

do
not
think
that
would
be
your
fate
th�oden

this
he

expect
an
attack
on
the
city
they

to
helms
deep
the
great
fortress
of
rohan
it
is
a
dangerous
road

men

fighting
the
new
fascist
regime
military
posts
are
established
to
exterminate
the
resistance
a
long
time
ago
in
the
underground
realm

where
there
are
no
lies
or
pain
there
lived
a
princess
who
dreamt
of
the
human
world
she
dreamt
of
blue
skies

soft
breeze
and
sunshine
one
day
eluding
her
keepers

the
princess
escaped
once
outside
the
bright
sun
blinded
her
and
erased
her
memory
she
forgot
who
she
was
and
where
she
came
from
her
body
suffered
cold

sickness
and
pain

and
eventually
she
died
however

her
father

the
king
always
knew
that
the
princess
soul
would
return
perhaps
in
another
body
in
another
place

at
another
time
he
would
wait
for
her

until
he
drew
his
last
breath
until
the
world
stopped
turning

my
brother
many

many
years
ago
in
a
sad

faraway
land
there
was
an
enormous
mountain
made
of
rough

black
stone
at
sunset
on
top
of
that
mountain
a
magic
rose
blossomed
every
night
that
made
whoever
plucked
it
immortal
but
no
one
dared
go
near
it
because
its
thorns
were
full
of
poison
men
talked
amongst
themselves
about
their
fear
of
death
and
pain

but
never
about
the
promise
of
eternal
life
and
every
day

the
rose
wilted
unable
to
bequeath
its
gift
to
anyone
forgotten
and
lost
at
the
top
of
that
cold

dark
mountain
forever
alone

until
the
end
of
time
come
in
how
is
she
very
weak
shell

as
much
rest

as

needs

creatures

full
of
magic
and
wonder
they
protected
one
another
and
slept
in
the
shade
of
a
colossal
fig
tree
that

on
a
hill

near
the
mill

the
tree
is
dying
lts
branches

dry

its
trunk
old
and
twisted
a
monstrous
toad
has
settled
in
its
roots
and
wont

the
tree
thrive
you
must
put
the
three
magic
stones
in
the
toads
mouth
and
retrieve
the
golden
key
from
inside
his
belly
only
then
will
the
fig
tree
flourish
again

captain
we

wrong
about
that
l
choose
to
be
here
because
l
want
my
son
to
be
born
in
a
new

clean
spain
because
these
people
hold
the
mistaken
belief
that
were
all
equal
but
theres
a
big
difference
the
war
is
over
and
we
won
and
if
we
need
to
kill
every
one
of
these
vermin
to
settle
it
then
well
kill
them
all

and
thats
that
were
all
here

by

and
l
met

l
mean

finding
each
other
again
oh

yes

very

very
curious
please

forgive
my
wife

she
hasnt
been
exposed
to
the
world
she
thinks
these
silly
stories
are
interesting
to
others
we

excuse
me

madam
ofelia

here

l
told
you
that
l
was
acquainted
with
your
father

captain
no

l
had
no
idea
ln
morocco
l
knew
him
only
briefly

but
he
left
a
great
impression
an
excellent
soldier
the
men
in
his
battalion
said
that
when
general
vidal
died
on
the
battlefield
he
smashed
his
watch
on
a
rock
so
that
his
son
would
know
the
exact
hour
and
minute
of
his
death
so
he
would
know
how
a
brave
man
dies
nonsense

he
didnt
own
a
watch
what
youve
done

she
was
hiding
under
your

what

of
this
ofelia

what
is
this
thing
doing
under
the
bed
lts
a
magic
root
the
faun

me
this

you

to
stop
all
this
no

l
want
to
leave
this
place
please

take
me
away
from

lets
just
go

please
things
are
not
that
simple
youre
getting
older
soon
youll
see
that
life
isnt
like
your
fairy
tales
the
world
is
a
cruel
place
and
youll
learn
that

even
if
it
hurts
no
no
ofelia
magic
does
not
exist

not
for
you

me
or
anyone
else
mom
help
why
did
you
do
it
lt
was
the
only
thing

no

you

obeyed
me
l

lt

for
you

you

l
dont

why
didnt
you
obey
me
to
obeyjust
like
thatfor
the
sake
of
obeying

without
questioning
thats
something
only
people
like
you
can
do

captain
captain
garces
call
the
troop
paramedic
get
up
immediately
yes

captain
your
wife
is
dead
because
the
paths
to
the
lord
are
inscrutable
because
the
essence
of
his
forgiveness
lies
in
his
word
and
in
his
mystery
because
although
god
sends
us
the
message
it
is
our
task
to
decipher
it
because
when
we
open
our
arms
the
earth
takes
in
only
a
hollow
and
senseless
shell
far
away
now
is
the
soul
in
its
eternal
glory
because
it
is
in
pain
that
we
find
the
meaning
of
life
and
the
state
of
grace
that
we
lose
when
we
are
born
because
god

in
his
infinite
wisdom

puts
the
solution
in
our
hands
and
because
it
is
only
in
his
physical
absence
that
the
place
he
occupies
in
our
souls
is
reaffirmed
you
knew
dr

ferreiro
pretty
well

didnt
you

mercedes
we
all
knew
him

sir

everyone
around
here
the
stutterer
spoke
of

informer

the
mill

you
imagine
right
under
my
nose
mercedes

please
what
must
you
think
of

valet
parking

an
unidentified
person

that
individual
was
driving
a
blue
s
ford
mustang
which
may
have
been
dented
on
the
left
side
police
have
released
a
surveillance
tape
confirming
the
eyewitness
account
but

seven
chicks

a
year
after
the
alleged
killer
abandoned
the
property
no
leads

no
way
of
iding
whoever
lived
there
cause
he
used
a
fake

hes
got
this
neighbor
who
i
guess

by
definition

would
also
be
your
neighbor
who
may

in
point
of
fact
be
a
coldblooded
killer
right
from
texas

right

well

hes
from
austin
yeah

is
that
so
yeah

yeah

thats
exhibit
a

robert
turner
yeah

ive
seen
him

so
well

so

the
missing
girls
from
madison
on
the
news
you
think
he
has
something
to
do
with
that
he
drives
a
car
just
like
the
one
she
was
last
seen
in

which
is
a
sera
mustang
a
sera
mustang
same
color

yeah

and
its
the
same
color
gee

that
really
narrows
it
down
well

you
know

the
news
said
that
car
was
dented
yeah

and
his
front
fenders
dented

yeah
right
its
cohesive
it
matches

the
whole
story

yeah
it
fits
i
am
seeing
the
mustang
but
no
bashedin
fender
what
yeah

no

its
there

its
there
if
i
could
just
it
should
be
there
thats
weird

howd
he
get
it
fixed
so
fast
maybe
cause
it
was
never
there
in
the
first
place
however

he
is
clearly
a
pack
rat
he
plays
volleyball
he
collects
skulls
what
here

let
me
see
thats
a
longhorn
skull
you
know
what
states
famous
for
longhorns
texas

and
what
states
the
killer
from
texas
fine

wheres
the
coffee
and
donuts
you
cant
have
a
stakeout
without
coffee
and
donuts
thats
everything
i
could
find
got
most
of
it
off
of
my
uncle

hes
a
typea
sociopath
how
long
has
turner
lived
there
i
dont
know

a
few
years
hey

check
this
out
the
victims
they
found
in
texas
were
preserved
delaying
their
decomposition
this
guy
was
so
sick
they
say
their
bodies
were
twisted
and
jammed
into
the
basement
walls
this
girl
died
from
blunt
trauma

most
likely
blows
to
the
head
and
face
gnarly

im
hungry
lets
order
pizza
hes
been
gone
a
while
howd
you
get
my

up

down
im
robert
turner
i
live
behind
you
its
just
a
little
rude
well

im
officially
welcoming
you
to
the
neighborhood
i
know
that
youve
been
following
me
dont

no

dont
dont
deny
it
im
not
upset

and

quite
frankly

i
dont
even
want
to
know
why
i
just
would
like
you
to
know
that
im
a
little
on
the
shy
side
so

short
of
all
this
sneaking
around
in
some
kind
of
hip

newaged
way
of
coming
on
to
a
somewhat
older
man
i
really
feel
obliged
to
tell
you
that
i
rather
enjoy
my
privacy
you
see

the
world
is
its
in
a
heightened
state
of
paranoia
and
i
tend
to
think
that
someone
as
intelligent
and
attractive
as
you
doesnt
need
to
be
wasting
her
time
stoking
the
fire
so

now
you
know
youre
not
the
only
one
whos
watching
so

feel
free
to
pass
that
along
if
youd
like
cool
are
we
cool
cool

cool
all
right

thats
it

give
me
the
phone

im
calling
the
cops
wait

he
didnt
do
anything
all
he
said
was
that
he
liked
his
privacy
but
think
about
that

why
does
he
want
his
privacy
i
mean

hes
hiding
something

we
know
that
yeah

definitely

right
and
he
knows
that
we
know
that

he
knows
that
and
regardless
of
if
he
had
a
bad
day
or
a
good
it
doesnt
matter
he
scared
the
hell
out
of
you

thats
a
grown
man
look

kale

he
freaked
me
out

but
hes
right
were
the
ones
spying

when

my
real
father

he
filled
in
all
the
missing
pieces
but
it
was
too
late

i
was
hooked
by
then

he
was
such
a
bitter
old
man
or
i
should
say

bitter

old

young
man
that
all
he
wanted
to
do
was
end
the
suffering
like
all
our
bloodline
before
us
he
was
more
than
willing
to
break
the
laws
of
your
sacred
little
club
so
i
got
him
to
give
me
his
share
of
the
power
and
he
died
knowing
that
his
son
was
going
to
get
revenge
on
your
covenant
you
keep
her
in
that
spell

and
shell
die
what
is
this
all

maybe
a
little
the
truth
is

it
is
but
almost
everyone
here

top
of
their

a
situation
up
here
could
you
please
come
to
surface
level
surprise
damn

i
hate
that
song
you
like
the
tunes
there

preach
carter

join
us

theres
too
much
woman
on
this
deck
for
scoggs
to
handle
vodka

straight
and
by
the
way

food
was
excellent

brother
youre
that
guy
that
got
caught
in
that
avalanche

right
black
men
have
enough
ways
to
get
killed
without
climbing
up
some
mountain
in
the
middle
of
nowhere
you
need
to
leave
that
to
the
white
folks

brother
ill
let
you
know
tomorrow
hows
life
underwater
thats
for
sure
nice
work
with
that
new
tiger
shark
today
one
day

youll
have
to
tell
me
how
you
learned
that
one
day

youll
take
me
up
on
that
beer
and
maybe
i
will
its
all
work
for
me

carter
but

like
you
said

one
day
sharks
never
get
cancer

go
blind
or
show
loss
of
brain
activity
as
they
age
unlike
some
people
i
know
sharks
are
the
oldest
creatures
on
the
planet
from
a
time
when
the
world
was
just
flesh
and
teeth
by
using
a
hormonal
enhancer
we
increased
this
females
forebrain
to
five
times
its
normal
size
to
harvest
more
protein
exactly

a
protein
that
may
reactivate
that
will
that
will
reactivate
human
brain
cells
stored
in
the
forebrain
of
the
shark
im
just
amazed
that
weve
come
so
far

so
fast

without
genetic
tampering
genetic
engineering
to
increase
brain
mass
violates
the
harvard
genetics
compact
not
to
mention
chimera
policy
theyre
hunting
in
packs
like
wild
dogs
theyll
only
eat
other
sharks
youre
reading
too
much
into
it
that
gen

attacked
a
foot
boat
am
i
reading
too
much
into
that
too
did
you
tell
franklin
im
just
a
fish
keeper

lady
but
bringing
in
that
shark
ahead
of
schedule
was
a
very
bad
idea
do
you
like
your
job
are
you
threatening
me

doc
but
if
we

pull
off
that
test

level
elevator
it
seals
off
automatically
to
keep
the
shaft
from
filling
theres
no
way
up
all
right

okay
if
this
is
a
lesson
about
the
drinking

lets
just
say
ive
learned
it
no
need
to
get
carried
away

showing
me
your
vengeful
side
i
know
your
wrath

lord
if
corridor
b
is
dry
we
go
back
to
the
maintenance
ladder

climb
down
to
level
we
get
to
the
wet
entry
we
take
the
sub
topside

two
at
a
time

we
go
down
to
get
up
all
right

lets
move

come
on
sounds
like
somebody
made
it
over
here
were
over
here
preach
lab
equipment
maybe

banging
around
think
so
we
got
to
get
past
that
door
go
go
bird
come
on

bird
where
are
you

bird
hey

dickhead
cowboy

let
me
ask
you
a
question

we
should
keep
moving
im
talking
to
him
was
that
a
goddamn
shark
that
broke
through
that
door
you
expect
so
well

well

well
am
i
the
only
asshole
down
here
who
thinks
that
a
tad
bit
odd
it
can
do
that
bust
through
a
steel
door
i
aint
the
expert
given
gen
s
size
and
some
room
to
move
she
could
put
a
couple
tons

maybe
more

into
a
hit
so

yeah

in
my
opinion
if
she
wants
through

shes
coming
and
these
sharks
they
arent
breaking
down
doors
for
the
sheer
joy
of
it

are
they
theyre
after
us
its
obvious
we
dont
know
what
theyre
doing
what
the
hell
did
you
do
to
those
sharks
their
brains
werent
large
enough
to
harvest
sufficient
amounts
of
the
protein
so
we
violated
the
harvard
compact
jim
and
i
used
gene
therapies
to
increase
their
brain
mass
larger
brain
means
more
protein
as
a
side
effect

the
sharks
got
smarter
you
stupid
bitch
i
didnt
want
this
to
happen
think
of
the
generations
that
would
be
saved
how
much
dynamite
do
you
have
to
set
off
in
your
ears
before
your
head
clears
i
wouldnt
dumb
old
carter
wouldnt
understand
that
you
used
us
that
you
used
me
someone
on
the
water
who
wouldnt
make
waves
someone
who
wouldnt
ask
too
many
questions
because
he
had
something
to
lose
you
dont
see
what
weve
done
here
youve
taken
gods
oldest
killing
machine
and
given
it
will
and
desire
its
not
a
great
leap
forward

in
my
book
the
people
well
save
jim
brenda
these
sharks
are
thinking
hard
and
clear
so
heres
the
riddle
what
does
an
pound
mako
shark
with
a
brain
the
size
of
a
v
engine
and
no
natural
predators

think
about
im
not
waiting
around
here
to
find
out
now
you
see
how
that
works
she
screwed
with
the
sharks
and
now
the
sharks
are
screwing
with
us
please
let
me
get
out
of
here
what
if
the
sharks
get
through
the
fence
and
into
the
ocean
its
okay

the
fence
on
the
ocean
side
is
titanium
and
it
gives

so
it
works
just
like
a
net
lets
get
to
the
sub

well
discuss
it
on
the
way
to
the
top
eat
me

asshole
please

baby
dickhead
see
daddy
smiling
bring
your
feathery
ass
here

come
on
explosion
caused
that
no
nothing
in
here
couldve
blown
with
enough
force
to
move
that
damn
sub
whatever

its
junk
we
could
all
just
dive
in
and
see
who
makes
it
to
the
top
you
could
go
first

to
lead
by
example
he
was
my
best
friend

janice
im
not
going
in
the
water
no
way

man
the
sharks
are
in
there

listen
we
put
these
on

they
help
fight
hypothermia

thats
a
start
and
unless
someones
got
a
better
idea
were
going
to
have
to
swim
out
of
here
cook
dies
in
his
own
oven
you
ate
my
bird
i
wouldnt
get
that
close
just
a
suggestion
waters
murky

we
might
make
it
no
way
no

we
wont
from
the
lagoon
floor
to
the
lagoon
surface
the
average
human
swims
two
feet
per
second
the
average
shark
swims

feet
per
second
theres
no
way
im
getting
into
that
pool
this
leads
up
to
the
surface
i
love
you

scoggs

i
really
do
why
do
i
feel
a
but
coming
on
but
we
dont
know
what
shape
the
surface
level
is
in
the
shaft
is
airlocked
but
if
the
explosion
breached
the
shaft
at
surface
level
we
wont
have
enough
pressure
to
stabilize
the
wet
pool
if
the
pool
isnt
stabilized

theres
tons
of
ocean
dying
to
get
in
youll
bring
the
whole
facility
down
were
better
off
with
the
sharks
you
want
to
swim
with
your
fishes
go
ahead
im
opening
this
door
and
climbing
out
of
here
thats
enough
now

from
all
of
you
you
think
waters
fast
you
should
see
ice

it
moves
like
it
has
a
mind
like
it
knows
it
killed
the
world
once

it
got
a
taste
for
murder
when
the
avalanche
came
it
took
us
a
week
to
climb
out
and
somewhere
we
lost
hope
i
dont
know
when
we
turned
on
each
other
i
just
know
that
seven
of
us
survived
the
slide
and
only
five
made
it
out
now

we
took
an
oath
that
im
breaking
now
swore
that
wed
say
it
was
the
snow
that
killed
the
other
two
nature
can
be
lethal
but
it
doesnt
hold
a
candle
to
man
youve
seen
how
bad
things
can
get
and
how
quick
they
can
get
that
way
well

they
can
get
a
whole
lot
worse
so
were
not
going
to
fight
anymore
were
going
to
pull
together
and
find
a
way
to
get
out
of
here
first

were
going
to
seal
off
this
pool
it
just
ate
him
it
just
ate
him

christ
im
not
moving
im
not
moving

someone
will
come
theyll
come
and
theyll
get
us

and
well
be
fine
listen

tom

what
is
the
precise
structural
failure
limit
for
aquatica
what
happens
when
we
get
more
than

tons
of
water
in
this
rig
the
support
struts
go
first

their
tolerance
is
about
seven
tons
theyll
crack
like
toothpicks
the
walls
will
buckle

they
cant
handle
more
than

tons
of
pressure
you
want
to
be
here
for
that
hell

no
the
moment
of
truth

again
go
go
go
if
we
make
it
to
level


we
can
take
the
stairs
out
if
we
make
it
to
level


we
can
take
the
stairs
out
what
are
you
doing
if
they
break
through

water
will
bring
them
right
to
us
level

is
only
partially
flooded

if
i
can
get
that
door
open
the
water
will
run
off
there

buy
us
some
time
whats
that
the
size
of
your
brass
balls
jan

stay
there
i
dont
want
to
die
grab
my
hand
come
on
i
cant
reach
good
thing
you
came
to
this
side

the
other
sides
underwater
are
you
all
that
made
it
were
on
level


we
can
take
the
stairs
to
the
surface
the
stairs
are
flooded

trust
me

i
know
give
us
a
goddamn
break

cant
you
he
always
answers
sometimes

the
answer
you
get
isnt
the
answer
you
want
were

feet
from
the
surface
theres
an
emergency
hatch
on
this
level

right
this
level
has
bilge
pumps
on
it
for
storm
runoff
if
we
reroute
the
emergency
generators

we
could
drain
a
stairway
who
you
going
to
trust
you

thats
right
you
trust
me
we
had
poker
here
tomorrow
night
even
in
death
standards
jan
was
a
healthy
girl

something
in
here
has
to
run
on
batteries
nice

where
would
a
girl
keep
her
whats
the
matter
with
you
my
skins
starting
to
hemorrhage
the
sharks
smell
the
blood

dont
think
i
couldve
done
it
without

seem
like
a
second
i

physics
explanation
ive
heard
it
works

me
and
scoggs
are
going

get
some
things
from
my
quarters

research
data
the
tests

they
worked
so
much
death
around
us

to
risk
any
more
life
for
some
numbers
without
that
data

everyone
dying
isnt
just
tragic

its
useless
death
is
always
useless

doctor
this
is
it
stay

i
hate
to
interrupt
this
moment
of
burgeoning
intimacy

get
the
fuck
out
of
here
whole
place
is
sinking

its
this
way
or
no
way
at
all
sharks
are
attracted
to
churning
water

bright
colors
these
extinguishers
will
be
a
distraction
the
vestll
bring
you
up
too
fast

your
lungsll
pop
like
a
balloon
you
werent
the
sunny
kid
in
your
class
how
far
to
the
surface
sixty
feet
exhale
on
the
way
up

and
get
the
hell
out
of
the
water
i
got
to
let
the
room
fill
up
with
water
itll
only
take
a
few
seconds
you
ready
not
in
the
least
for
thou
art
with
me
for
thou
art
with
me
thy
rod
and
thy
staff

they
comfort
me
surely
goodness
and
mercy
shall
follow
me
all
the
days
of
my
life
because
i

to
jeremy
goober

with
attorney
general
office
jeremy
is
in
charge
of
the
seattle
slayer
task
force
dr

gramm

its
so
good
to
meet
you

this
is
a
really
big
honor
for
me
sorry
about
the
oh

this
is
such
a
beautiful
conference
room
too
and
this
special
agent
mactire
from
the
fbi
pleasure

have
a
seat
hey

big
fellow
jeremy
seattle
slayer
task
force
well

okay

im
sure
you
have
a
lot
of
questions
ill
do
the
best
i
can
to
answer
them

but
first
i
no

first
i
think
we
should
all
have
a
cookie
these
are
from
janie
kay

whose
sister

janie
was
murdered
by
john
forster
jeremy
sure

thank
you
frank
no

thanks

jack
mr

mactire
you
are
a
good
sport

jeremy
a
little
milk
maybe

what
do
you
think
shelley

we
got
milk

dont
we
bring
in
three
glasses
nothing
for
me

jack
all
right

make
that
two
no

make
it
three
maybe
you
have
a
change
of
heart
so

lets
see
i
can
assume
that
last
night
crime
scene
was
very
much
like
forsters
previous
crime
scene

right
they
totally
match

yeah

what
totally
matches
i
have
in
here
halothane
on
the
breath

subdued
by
halothane
rape

yeah
the
body
was
hung
up
side
down
slashed
throat
and
where
this
takes
us
looks
like
a
copy
cat
it
could
be

maybe
could
be
maybe
maybe

its
a
stage
scene

maybe
what
maybe

and
this
might
be
farfetched
but
what
if
the
perp
worked
with
forster
and
these
stage
scenes
were
intended
to
throw
some
doubts
on
his
guilty
verdict
go
with
it

possibly
providing
him
with
a
stay
of
execution
or
even
a
new
trial
goal
star

jeremy

big
goal
star
i
mean

thats
exactly
what
i
think
is
happening
here
no

im
sticking
with
copy
cat
of
course
there
is
another
possibility
yeah
forster
is
innocent
wrongly
convicted

no
the
task
force
is
aware
that
your
expert
opinion
was
critical
in
convicting
forster
but
then
why
he
walked
his
first
trial
procedural
error
why
is
he
never
been
tried
in
any
of
the
other
five
pending
murderers
that
youve
attributed
to
him
you
realize
that
it
is
the
dude
of
my
office
to
ensure
that
an
innocent
man
is
not
executed
tonight

you
do
understand
that
look

jack

if
you
have
any
reconsideration
of
testimony
or
anything
new
you
wanna
lay
on
the
table
now
it
would
be
the
time
would
you
say
it
was
fair
to
characterize
your
attitude
towards
john
forster
as
a
personal
vendetta
lf
were
been
fair

yeah

sure
its
a
personal
vendetta

i
have
a
personal
vendetta
against
ted
bundy
and
gacy
and
about

or

other
serial
murders
that
are
on
the
streets
right
now

we

a
relationship

dr

mental
puzzle

theyre
no
actual
tangible
pieces
per
say
he
made
a
guess
based
on
what
happened
to
kate
a
guess
based
on
his
intuition

a
personal
bias

ego
and
he
sold
that
fiction

expert
in
forensic
psychiatry
what

forensic
psychiatry

profession

macmortons
life
by
conjuring
up
images
of
child
molestation
none
of
the
charges
were
ever
proved

and
the
accused

though
innocent
was
public
crucified

sorry

im

again

thank

kim
i
see
that
the
size
of
our
class
is
dwindling
once
again
it
could
be
because
you
keep
booting
everyone
my
favorite
student

mike
stempt
okay

the
legal
distinction
between
sanity
and
insanity
rests
upon
what
free
will

the
concept
of
the
free
will
and
what
is
the
most
important
thing
one
should
remember
when
entering
a
courtroom
that
insanity
its
a
legal
concept

its
not
a
medical
or
psychiatric
term
but
despite
the
fact
that
insanity
is
a
legal
concept
it
doesnt
mean
that
someone
is
not
sick
yes

lauren
of
all
the
serial
killers
that
ive
interviewed
and
studied
witch
include
our
boy
bundy

dahmer

gacy
none
of
them
was
legally
insane
this
is
not
saying
that
they
were
normal
i
could
argue
that
they
couldnt
help
themselves
precisely
because
of
their
mental
disorder
well

if
you
wanna
argue

mike
school
of
law
is
across
campus
come
on

dr

gramm
its
ingenuous
to
pretend
that
our
presentations
are
not
arguments
we
create
a
narrative
of
the
crime
and
the
criminal
narrative
is
based
on
facts

based
on
logic
we
dont
walk
into
a
courtroom
and
advocate
set
scenes

do
we
we
dont
take
sides

we
check
our
views
at
the
door
you
mean
you
want
us
to
pretend
we
dont
have
an
opinion
we
have
opinions

lauren

but
we
just
keep
them
to
ourselves
share
them
with
your
dog

if
you
have
to
not
with
your
parrot

because
it
talks
back
it
is
that
kind
of
logic
thats
gonna
get
you
in
a
law
school
across
campus
ive
been
there

ive
done
that
well

my
condolences

ive

why

your
conclusions
is
it
possible
that
forster
is
innocent
you
wont
even
consider
the
possibility
youre
completely
convinced
the
scenario
you
put
together
is
the
only
one
first
of
all

i
didnt
put
together
a
scenario
i
recreated
the
crime
scene

second
i
didnt
convict
forster

a
jury
did
but
the
evidence
was
circumstantial
no
dna

no
murder
weapon
nothing
directly
linking
forster
to
the
crime

your
narrative
and
janie

okay
you

joining

dr

are
you
there
im
here
have
you
been
watching
the

call

to
say
or
you
wouldnt

i
think
its
very
interesting
that
forster
talks
about
forgiveness
i
just
want
him
to
know
that
his
victims
have
not
forgiven
him
look

youve
lied
under
oath

dr

gramm

and
you
know
it
this
is
not
about
me

this
about
the
women
youve
raped
and
tortured
and
murdered
women
like
janie
kay

i
have
nothing
to
do
with
her
death
and
you
know
it

nothing
to
do
with
her
death
there
was
an
eyewitness

a
twin
sister
who
identified
you
she
was
at
the
scene
and
identified
you
she
was
drugged
and
beaten
so
badly
she
said
that
she
couldnt
be
sure

but
you
you
bereaved
her
until
she
said
it
was
me
interesting
that
you
didnt
say
that
youre
innocent
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
death
no

i
dont

i
know
youre
convicted
youre
convicted
by
a
jury
you
were
trialed
and
convicted

thats
what
i
know
trial
that
wasnt
a
trial

that
was
an
inquisition
and
the
jury
believed
your
lies
you
had
to
cause
pain

suffer
and
death

so
you
could
feel
alive
wait
a
second
pain
and
suffer
is
something
that
you

forensics

know
how
to
inflict
even
your
idol

ted
bundy

ultimately

identified
his
victims
how
about

your
victims

my
apartment
in
new
york
city
she
was


i
was
and
i
was
late
for
a
meeting

very
important
meeting
a
meeting
that
was
gonna
change
my
life
it
was
gonna
make
me
into
somebody
important
make
all
my
dreams
come
true

so
i
went
to
this
meeting
on
my
dissertation
and
i
left
her
there
by
herself
i
could
have
taken
her
with
me

i
could
have
left
her
with
friends
i
could
have
postpone
the
meeting
but
i
chose
not
to

because
i
was
in
a
hurry
anyway

i
left
her
there
alone
at
that
time
i
was
working
in
a
case
and
this
guy
had
strangled
six
women
we
were
very
close
to
nail
him
he
was
upset
and
he
wanted
to
get
back
at
me
so
he
came
to
my
apartment

only
i
wasnt
there
and
that
time
i
wasnt
concerned
with
security
i
was
careless
so
he
broke
the
door
down
and
he
went
in
things
to
my
baby
sister
katheryn

was
her
name
he
did
things
that
you
wouldnt
do
to
an
animal
that
was
bred
for
slaughter
anyway
when
they
caught
him
he
laughed
and
said
it
took
him

minutes
it
took
him

minutes
to
have
my
sister
dead
he
is
in
prison
now
coming
up
for
his
fifth
parole
hearing
i
left
new
york

all
that
behind
me

off
corner
of
the
continent

to
my
class

i
remember
you

individual
you
challenged
things
you
challenged
me

challenged
ideas
youre
your
own
person
how
could
you
ever
allowed
yourself
to
be
so
manipulated
by
this
guy
seconds

take
the
fall

guy
if

what
he
wants

so
be

walla

im
placing
a
call
from
john
forster
to
his
attorney
lydia
doherty
lydia
did
you
finish
with
gramm
shes
downstairs

gramm
put
my
attorney
on
the
phone

please
shes
indisposed
look

youre
meddling
her

you
shouldnt
be
meddling
in
you
seized
a
naive
junior
lawyer
on
your
legal
staff
you
realized
that
shes
damaged
psychologically
and
genius

isnt
it
susceptible
to
your
craps

and
what
you
do
you
get
her
to
kill
people
for
you
so
you
can
stay
alive
thats
an
innovative
legal
strategy

if
i
have
ever
heard
of
any
dr

gramm

im
flattered
with
your
imagination
but
youre
grasping
in
straw
she
becomes
a
student
of
mine

no
less
you
keep
her
on
the
appeal
process

but
shes
still
your
lawyer
so
she
has
unlimited
access
to
you
so
you
can
plan
your
copy
cat
murders
together
and
then
you
can
get
a
new
trial
and
live
happily
ever
after

isnt
that
the
case
dr

gramm

i
want
you
to
listen
very
closely
because
when
i
get
out
of
here
im
gonna
go
out
and
have
a
nice
meal
stop
by
your
grave
and
piss
all
over
it
now

please

put
my
angelical
attorney
on
the
phone
its
over

forster
except
for
the
clock

that
goes
tictac
tictac

you

hours
to
live
all
right

fellows
how
is
lynn
johnson
well
she
just
threw
out
of
the

didnt
want
me

jack

i
have
to
ask
you
something
was
lydia
telling
the
truth
did
you
coach
janie
you
believe
forster
killed
those
people
all
those
people
yes

janies
sister
and
everybody
yes

beyond
reasonable
doubt
absolutely

what
would
you
have
done
in
my
shoes
dont
answer
it
think
about
it
justice
and
truth
where
do
they
intersect
hello

everyone
john
forster
is
dead
his
execution
is
not
a
cause
for
celebration
nor
is
a
vindication
it
is
a
chapter
in
the
road
to
justice
and
recovery
i
personally
dont
believe
in
capital
punishment
i
do
believe
in
the
rights
of
the
victims
i
do
believe
that
they
deserve
recompense
no
matter
how
significant
or
insignificant
it
may
be
in
comparison
to
the
loss
suffered
ive
suffered
such
a
loss
and
like
some
of
you
here
ive
spent
those
sleepless
nights
trying
desperately
to
squelch
down
that
bullish
instinct
for
revenge
and
i
have
wondered
jack

look
at
me

look
at
the
kite
if
this
pain
will
ever
abate

smile
ive
learnt
that
time
does
not
heal
the
wound
it
will
though

in
its
most
merciful
way
plant
the
edge
ever

slightly

yours
all
yours
look

sara

youre
great
youre
a
very
sexy

smart

interesting

somewhat
unusual
woman
but
we
i
always
think
its
best
to
clarify
issues
you
are
the
most
egotistical
man
ive
ever
met
i
am
talking
about
a
month
the
truth
is

i
dont
have
a
month

time
is
money
okay

lets
just
how
long
do
you
think
you
could
put
this
big

lucrative
career
of
yours
on
hold
just

just
god

what
am
i
talking
about
you
are
unemployed
you
dont
have
a
job
you
got
fired

nelson
you
have
nothing
to
go
back
to
this
project
of
yours
feels
like
an
excuse
to
get
laid
sara

im
sorry

i
sara

i
didnt
mean
to
i
didnt
think
youd
i
dont
understand
why
youre
doing
this

is
all
i
told
you
i
have
my
reasons
still
friends
only
if
you
give
me
what
i
want
all
i
can
do
is
a
day

ill
take
it
ill
take
it
always
a
thrill
to
explore
new
career
possibilities
how
much
do
you
charge
i
dont
do
this
for
the
money

why
do
you
do
it
i
like
it

you
can
take
them
off
the
leashes
come
on

oh

yes

youre
so
excited

i
know
yeah

you
go
raise
some
hell
dont
tell
your
mom

okay
you
can
let
them
go

you
know

nelson
come
on
come
on

lets
go

come
on
get
off
me
so
when
was
the
last
time
you
spent
a
whole
day
outside
when
my
parents
dragged
me
to
alcatraz
for
the
day
at
the
age
of
now
you
tell
me
something

anything
what
was
so
enlightening
about
what
we
did
today
why
is
letting
some
dogs
go
wild
a
better
way
to
live
than
my
way
granted

it
was
mildly
amusing

but
my
third
eye
didnt
open
well

these
things
take
time
and
you
dont
have
time
no

seriously

its
a
question
of
values
why
is
doing
something
fundamentally
trivial
better
than
living
a
responsible
life
boring
as
that
might
seem
to
you
and
who
made
you
the
expert

the
doctor

the
guru
why
do
you
have
all
the
answers
well

i
used
to
own
this
company
called
sublime
pets
no

i
really
did
and
then
i
quit

it
wasnt
fun
anymore

you
know
before
or
after
you
toured
as
a
standup
comedian
i
never
did
that
this
would
be
really
good
for
you
sharpen
your
instincts
not
those
kind
of
instincts
so
the
object
of
the
game
get
your
hands
off
me
i
run
around

you
lose
track
of
me

then
you
no

no
peeking

hands
off
count
to
then
come
find
me
one

two

three
im
gonna
get
you
four

five

six
i
know
where
you
are
seven

eight

nine

ten
oh

nelson

that
was
terrible
you
didnt
even
get
close
im
sorry

are
you
okay
sara

youre
not
going
to
be
upset
when
i
leave
tonight
i
told
you
one
day
yeah

of
course
mitch
was
my
october
he
was
so
shy
i
think
he
was
the
shyest
man
ive
ever
met
we
focused
on
strengthening
his

chaz

your

why
does

me

talk

thats
not
fair
you
expect

honest
so
forthcoming
because
its
your
month

nelson
not
mine
come
on

you
dont
want
to
hear
about
stupid
family
stuff
dont
be
mad
youre
not
feeling
well

are
you
maybe
tomorrow
well
get

pjs
every
woman
i

on
a
haircut
quit
trying
to
change
the
subject
you
made
a
commitment

nelson

our
time
isnt
over
its
one
meeting
why
is
going
to
some
powwow
with
this
slicko
guy

vince

such
a
big
deal
because
its
probably
the
chance
of
a
lifetime

thats
why
if
its
a
whole
lifetime

why
not
just
postpone
it
for
one
more
week
sara

when
edgar
price
says
hell
meet
you
you
dont
say
wait

how
about
next
month
you
say

thank
you

ill
be
there
hes
one
of
the
greats
wheres
my
phone
i
hate
it
we
can
take
anything
and
just
sell
it

make
it
work
exactly

i
mean

weve
done
very
well
with
telecomputer
actually

im
sure
youre
aware
of
no

i
wasnt
i
think
that
was
last
years
spot
so
we
have
a
symbiosis

the
two
of
us

as
a
team
we
know
a
lot
of
guys
who
do
this
for
the
awards

mr

price
not
to
say
we
dont
get
the
awards
but
still
were
not
about
the
acclaim
handholding

dinners
sending
prostitutes
to
the
client

prostitutes
who
sends
prostitutes
who
doesnt
were
about
the
work
if
the
work
is
great

it
speaks
for
itself
thats
all
i
need
to
know
but
are
you
married

any
kids
no

weve
avoided
the
family
thing
for
quite
some
time
most
of
our
lives

good
because
if
youre
worried
about
quality
of
life
or
paternity
leave
as
much
as
i
like
you

we
can
stop
right
here
i
want
to
be
your
fulltime
commitment
i
can
do
that
we
still
had
two
weeks
to
go

whats
two
weeks
youre
kicking
him
out
anyway

good
shot
you
know
what
i
shouldve
locked
him
in
there
i
shouldve
tied
him
to
the
bed
what

do
you
mean
you
didnt
it
wouldnt
have
stopped
him
you
cant
force
people
to
do
what
they
dont
want
to
thats
the
whole
point
of
this
thing

isnt
it
besides

i
know
guys
like
nelson
you
may
have
bitten
off
more
than
you
can
chew
this
time
thats
what
i
like
about
him
its
also
what
scares
the
hell
out
of
me
plus

some
leads
on
some
new
accounts

so
we
come
to
you
fully
loaded
youre
not
selling
me
a
car

holland
frankly

im
not
impressed
with
you

but
your
reputation
precedes
you
and
if
i
have
to
take
him
to
get
you

i
will
so
heres
my
offer
its
good
as
long
as

this
table
oh

my
thats
okay

stop
it
you
know

sweetie
we
are
what
we
do
in
this
world

and
youre
a
waitress
all
that
requires
is
that
you
bring
food
and
drink
to
and
from
the
table
without
making
a
mess
so
when
you
screw
up
something
as
incredibly
simple
as
that
it
doesnt
say
a
whole
hell
of
a
lot
about
you

does
it
im
im
sorry
if
you
gave
a
penny
for
her
thoughts

get
change

got
to
understand
something
shes
completely
powerless
with

rules

you
know
they
give
her
the
illusion
and
dignity
of
control
its
kept
her
alive
the
rift
with
her
family

thats
what
its
about
these
rules
her
family
couldnt
handle
it

they
wouldnt
let
go
they
kept
trying
to
run
her
disease
so
she
took
off
and
came
here
she
told
me
if
she
couldnt
live
a
normal
life
she
was
determined
to
live
an
abnormal
one
the
best
way
she
could
she
loves

ever
met

most
of
the

k�bi
my

the
jetty
that

refreshing
if
papa
and
martin

the

minus
and
i
will
get

karin
and
i
put
out
the
nets

while
minus

wont
do
either

ill
decide
for
myself
what
i
want
to
do
i
havent
seen
you
all
day

minus

lets
go
why
should
women
always
decide
i
say
we
do
as
karin
says

that
way
we
wont
lose
our
dignity
think
of
the
time
wed
have
saved
if
papa
had
decided
that
right
off
should
we
get
dressed
before
we
put
out
the
nets

do
you
think
isnt
it
rather
chilly

my
bathrobe

thinner
than
yours
if
youre
cold
me
cold
not
a
bit

are
you
youre
the
one
who
said
it
was
chilly

there
is
a
bit
of
a
breeze

though
well
harden
ourselves

virility
overrules
health

right
if
hemingway
could
do
it

so
can
we

forward
march
think
therell
be
a
thunderstorm
no

not
tonight
i
dont
know

look
at
those
clouds
are
you
afraid
of
thunder
you
have
no
idea
how
terrified
i
am
of
it
when
it
would
roll
through
the
alps

god
help
us
did
you
like
it
there
otherwise
i
was
homesick
but
i
wasnt
coming
home
until
id
finished
the
novel
and
now
its
finished
hows
your
ulcer
soso
can
you
prescribe
something
it
hurts
due
to
the
climate
change
well
go
to
the
pharmacy
tomorrow

i
have
errands
to
run
anyway
did
you
get
my
last
letter
i
sent
it
on
monday
i
was
in
basel
visiting
the
waldsteins

they
send
their
regards
then
you
didnt
get
it
i
flew
here
on
wednesday

then
you
didnt
get
it
was
it
important
it
was
about
karin
i
felt
i
had
to
write
even
if
it
disturbed
your
writing
a
cuckoo

didnt
you
hear
it
no
surely
you
hear
it
now

where
there
when
did
you
wash
your
ears
out
last
stop
it

yours
are
too
sensitive
its
strange

but
since
my
illness

my
hearing
has
become
so
acute
maybe
its
the
electric
shock
therapy
how
did
papa
look
to
you
yesterday
when
he
arrived
from
switzerland
how
do
you
mean
i
thought
he
looked
gray
tired
from
the
journey

i
suppose

probably
but
he
doesnt
seem
happy
is
marianne
coming
here
martin
said
they
broke
up
poor
papa

alone
again
i
never
liked
marianne
she
put
on
such
airs
and
poor
papa
looked
so
ordinary
next
to
her
and
then
she
sneered
at
his
books
papa
has
to
get
good
reviews
on
this
book
but
everybody
reads
his
books
he
doesnt
care
about
the
sales
he
wants
to
be
a
writer
youre
so
tall
and
so
serious
dont
look
so
hurt

i
love
you

little
minus
youve
grown
so
tall

stop
being
so
silly
seventeen
and
nearly
ten
feet
tall
wheres
your
girlfriend
whod
want
to
be
with
me
dont
be
mad
because
i
laughed
at
you
edgar
is
the
only
psychiatrist
i
trust
hes
treated
her
all
along
when
karin
came
home
from
the
hospital
last
month
he
and
i
had
a
good
talk
he
couldnt
guarantee
a
permanent
recovery
she
seems
unusually
well
she
hasnt
been
sleeping
well
her
hearing
has
become
very
acute

thats
about
it
how
much
does
she
know
she
actually
knows
the
whole
truth
about
her
illness
but
not
that
its
relatively
incurable
you
say
relatively
edgar
has
had
cases
of
full
recovery

so
there
is
hope
how
are
things
between
you
the
days
pass
by
as
usual
ive
given
my
lectures
all
spring
and
examined
numerous
students
ive
come
to
realize
that
i
love
her
and
that
im
helplessly
bound
to
her

whatever
happens
ive
become
the
anchor
of
her
existence
perhaps
her
only
security
well

shall
we
put
out
the
nets
keep
away
from
me
stop
hugging
and
kissing
me
stop
sunbathing
half
naked

you
disgust
me
you
know
very
well
what
i
mean

women
are
horrible
how
they
smell
and
move
around

how
they
stick
out
their
stomachs
how
they
comb
their
hair
and
talk
makes
me
feel
like
a
skinned
rabbit
thanks

i
can
give
myself
all
the
pity
i
want
whats
wrong
ive
never
seen
you
like
this
please
dont
tell
martin
or
papa
dont
be
silly
i
wish
i
could
talk
to
papa

just
once
hes
so
wrapped
up
in
himself
him
too
lets
go
home
i
spilled
the
milk

careless
boy
damn
i
hate
it
when
i
hurt
my
finger

a
bandage
on
it
martin

his
finger

lets
have
a
look
ill
put
the
milk

bandage

fuss

a
little
finger
isnt
it
beautiful

david

thanks
for
the
lovely
gloves
weve
got
a
surprise
for
you
too
we
have
to
blindfold
you

dont
peek
ill
take
care
of
this

you
go
ahead
i
cant
see
a
thing
its
like
walking
on
clouds

whos
idea
was
this
karin
and
i
helped
wait
and
see
this
is
almost
like
shakespeare
our
play
is
called
the
artistic
haunting
or
the
tomb
of
illusions
let
the
play
begin
its
midnight
in
saint
teresas
chapel
here
i
shall
meet
my
hearts
desire
here

by
this
tomb
redolent
with
the
smell
of
death
someone
moved
inside

could
it
be
her
ill
hide
so
as
not
to
frighten
her
i
am
the
princess
of
castile
who
died
in
childbirth
in
her
th
year
my
husband
and
beloved
master

who
was
my
playmate
as
a
child
has
turned
to
other
women
princess

i
love
you
i
cannot
speak
to
just
anybody

even
though
i
am
dead
fear
not

fair
lady
i
am
ruler
of
my
own
kingdom

small
and
poor
though
it
may
be
i
am
an
artist
an
artist
yes

princess
an
artist
of
the
purest
kind
a
poet
without
poems

a
painter
without
paintings
musician

a
musician
without
notes
i
scorn
readymade
art

the
banal
result
of
vulgar
effort
my
life
is
my
work

and
it
is
dedicated
to
my
love
for
you
beautiful
words

but
hard
to
believe
i
beg
of
you

put
me
to
the
test
listen
carefully

in
a
moment
i
will
leave
you
when
the
convent
clock
strikes
you
shall
enter
the
tomb
and
blow
out
the
three
candles
inside
at
that
instant
the
doors
will
close
forever
and
you
shall
join
me
in
death
an
easy
sacrifice

my
princess
for
what
is
life
to
a
true
artist
you
thus
perfect
your
work
of
art
and
crown
your
love
you
ennoble
your
life
and
show
the
skeptics
what
a
true
artist
can
do
do
not
fail
me
i
face
the
moment
of
ultimate
perfection
i
tremble
with
anticipation
oblivion
shall
own
me
and
death
alone
shall
love
me
i
will
go

nothing
can
stop
me
i
am
waiting
ye
devils

what
am
i
about
to
do
sacrifice
my
life
for
what
for
eternity
for
the
perfect
work
of
art
for
love
have
i
gone
mad
i
am
waiting
who
shall
see
my
sacrifice
death
who
shall
gauge
the
depth
of
my
love
a
ghost
and
who
shall
thank
me
eternity
my
knees
turn
to
clay

my
whole
body
trembles
and
my
insides
run
like
water
i
cannot
enter
eternity
with
i
shall
wait
no
longer
well
such
is
life
i
could

of
course

write
a
poem
about
my
meeting
with
the
princess
or
paint
a
picture
or
compose
an
opera
although
it
would
need
a
more
heroic
ending
oblivion
shall
own
me
and
death
alone
shall
love
me
the
cock
heralds
the
dawn
i
shall
go
home
to
bed
thats
all

so
defenseless

out
into
the
wilderness
at
night
the
owls
fly
past

watching
you
with
their
yellow
eyes
you
hear
the
pitterpatter
and
rustling

the
soughing
and
sighing
all
the
damp
noses
sniffing
at
you
the
wolves
bare
their
teeth
dont
worry

you
and
i
have
each
other
you
look
worried

not
so
sure

not
worried

no
wolves
i
see
nothing

and
theres
no
owl

sound

wolf

rosy
from
the
blustering
wind
they
met
on
the
beach

kajsa

later
than
hello

papa

my
book
which
is
never
much
fun
read
to
me

later

when
i
get
the
proofs
how
come
youre
not
asleep
some
birds
made
frightening
noises
right
at
sunrise
they
woke
me
up
and
then
i
didnt
dare
go
back
to
sleep
just
like
when
i
was
little
now
youll
sleep

youll
see
they
met
on
the
beach
it
was
a
clear
day
autumn
was
in
the
air
karin
just
fell
asleep
want
to
come
and
pull
in
the
nets
ill
be
right
there
last
summer
i
was
as
good
at
walking
on
my
hands
as
on
my
feet
now
im
so
tall

ive
lost
all
balance
same
here
you
mean
spiritually

i
get
it
do
you
write
these
days
plays
may
i
read
some
of
it

theyre
not
very
good
have
you
written
a
lot
thirteen
plays
and
an
opera
this
summer
my
goodness
it
comes
gushing
out
of
me

isnt
it
the
same
for
you
what
did
you
think
of
our
play
last
night
honestly
i
thought
it
was
crap
her
illness
is
incurable
with
periods
of
temporary
improvement
i
have
long
suspected
it
but
the
certainty
is
nevertheless
almost
unbearable
im
horrified
by
my
curiosity
by
my
urge
to
record
its
course
to
make
an
accurate
description
of
her
gradual
disintegration
to
use
her
martin

wake
up

how
long
are
you
going
to
sleep
time
for
a
swim

get
up
now
what
time
is
it
almost
heavens

have
i
slept
that
long
you
little
imp

its
only


so
what
ive
been
up
for
ages
and
had
all
kinds
of
odd
experiences
while
you

over
here

no

get
up

were
going
for
a
swim
papa
and
minus

the
nets

much
thats
what
makes
you
such
a
knowitall
my
little
one

whats
wrong
what
is
it

karin
i
have
a
confession
when
papa
went
out
just
now

i
rummaged
through
his
desk
i
dont
know
why

i
just
felt
i
had
to
i
found
his
diary

and
hed
written
things
in
it

like
what
about
me
what
had
he
written
i
cant
tell
you
about
your
illness
is
it
true
its
incurable
dearest
karin

listen
to
me
listen
to
me

a
relapse
its
possible
he
misunderstood
me
no
one
can
say
your
illness
is
incurable
word
of
honor
there
was
more
please

i
couldnt
possibly
ask
him
yourself
karin

little
karin
martin
you
must
be
patient
with
me
im
sure
my
desire
will
come
back
dont
you
think
oh

does
it
worry
you
not
in
the
least
listen

im
terribly
tired
but
i
still
think
we
should
go
for
a
swim
its
not
cold
at
all
imagine
having
a
stable
wife
who
gave
you
children

and
coffee
in
bed
who
was
big
and
soft
and
warm
and
beautiful
its
you
i
love

of
course

but
all
the
same
i
dont
want
anyone
else
funny
even
though
you
always
say
and
do
the
right
thing
it
turns
out
wrong
if
i
do

its
out
of
love
he
that
loves
for
real
always
does
right
by
his
loved
one
in
that
case
you
dont
love
me
bye

minus
make
sure
poor
minus
doesnt
fall
asleep
over
his
latin
i
said
id
test
him
on
his
grammar

bye

my
girl
dont
forget
your
brandy

and
get
a
bottle
of
white
wine
my
very
thought
bye

darling

well
be
back
for
dinner
what
the
hell
are
you
laughing
at
have
a
look

if
its
so
amusing
which
are
your
favorites
dont
be
such
an
old
maid

come
and
show
me
you
like
her
best
why
shes
so
soft
i
think
shes
pretty
too

but
isnt
she
a
bit
fat
and
her
hair
is
so
long
she
doesnt
look
too
deep
but
it
doesnt
help
me
a
damn
bit
are
you
going
to
hit
me
it
was
my
fault

forgive
me
calm
down

minus
it
doesnt
matter

dont
worry
i
was
silly
and
curious

forgive
me
i
dont
mean
to

it
just
happens
did
you
study
more
or
less
shall
i
test
you
if
youd
like
i
wonder
if
everyone
is
caged
in
you
in
your
cage

i
in
mine
each
in
his
own
little
cube

everybody
i
dont
feel
caged
in
at
all
then
im
wrong

as
usual
constructio
ad
sensum

what
does
that
mean
it
means
that
a
grammatically
correct
construction
is
changed
to
suit
the
context
for
example
its
so
hot
and
ive
been
up
since
lets
have
a
cigarette

got
any
if
you
look
long
enough
with
your
head
tilted
to
one
side
it
gives
you
the
creeps
the
creeps
though
its
fascinating
i
dont
talk
to
papa
or
martin
about
it

they
dont
understand
particularly
not
martin

hes
too
anxious
and
has
enough
worries
as
it
is
they
dont
understand

they
just
think
im
sick
do
you
think
so
too
no
i
knew
you
didnt
youre
stronger
ive
so
often
wanted
to
talk
to
you
about
it
all

its
like
a
you
can
trust
me
its
hard
not
to
talk
about
something
thats
constantly
on
your
mind
but
i
dont
think
the
others
would
mind
my
telling
you
dont
fluster
me
with
a
lot
of
stupid
questions
either
i
tell
you
all
i
dare

or
its
over
im
curious

thats
fine
for
you
let
me
show
you
something
i
walk
through
the
wall

you
see
early
in
the
morning
im
woken
by
someone
calling
me
in
a
firm
voice
i
rise
and
come
to
this
room
one
day
someone
called
me
from
behind
the
wallpaper
i
looked
in
the
closet

but
there
was
no
one
there
but
the
voice
kept
calling
me
so
i
pressed
myself
against
the
wall

and
it
gave
way

like
foliage
and
i
was
inside
you
think
im
making
it
up
i
enter
a
large
room
its
bright
and
peaceful
people
are
moving
back
and
forth
some
of
them
talk
to
me

and
i
understand
them
its
so
nice

and
i
feel
safe
in
some
of
their
faces
theres
a
shining
light
everyone
is
waiting
for
him
to
come
but
no
one
is
anxious
they
say
that
i
can
be
there
when
it
happens
why
are
you
crying
nothing
to
worry
about
but
sometimes
i
have
this
intense
yearning
i
long
for
that
moment
when
the
door
will
open
and
all
the
faces
will
turn
to
him
who
is
coming
no
one
has
said
for
certain
but
i
think
its
god
who
will
reveal
himself
to
us
that
it
will
be
him
coming
into
the
room
through
that
door
i
have
something
difficult
to
tell
you
whats
that
i
turn
away
from
martin
he
stands
there
calling
me

but
i
cant
help
him
it
all
becomes
like
a
game
does
he
notice
anything
im
not
sure
i
must
choose
between
him
and
the
others
ive
made
up
my
mind
ive
sacrificed
martin
is
all
this
for
real
i
dont
know
im
caught
in
the
middle

and
sometimes
im
uncertain
i
know
ive
been
ill
and
that
my
illness
was
like
a
dream
but
these
are
no
dreams
they
must
be
real

they
must
be
real
theyre
not
real
for
me

not
in
the
least
theyre
not
real
for
me

oh

yes
a
god
steps
down
from
the
mountain
he
walks
through
the
dark
forest
there
are
wild
beasts
everywhere
in
the
silent
darkness
it
must
be
real
im
not
dreaming

im
telling
the
truth
now
im
in
one
world

now
in
the
other
i
cant
stop
it
shall
we
go
for
a
swim
ill
go
alone
then
im
sleepy
im
going
to
sleep
a
bit
close
the
door
when
you
leave
stop
that
get
out
what
the
hell
am
i
to
do
well

have
you
prepared
your
latin
lets
continue
but
first
well
have
some
tea
will
you
tell
papa
and
martin
clever
answer

but
you
dont
fool
me
tonight
youll
take
martin
aside
and
say
i
have
to
talk
to
you
about
karin

and
then
youll
tell
him
everything
cant
you
tell
him
promise
not
to
say
anything
youre
the
only
one
who
understands
say
one
word
and
youve
betrayed
me
it
looks
like
rain

do
you
think
so
whats
with
you
what
do
you
mean
youre
so
quiet

almost
hostile
its
not
worth
talking
about

please
its
about
karin

karin
she
rummaged
through
your
desk
and
found
your
diary
and
she
read
it

of
course
what
did
you
write
karin
wanted
me
to
ask
you
i
wrote
that
her
illness
is
incurable
that
i
felt
a
horrible
urge
to
record
its
course
theres
no
one
else
to
blame
ive
no
excuse
its
always
about
you
and
yours
your
callousness
is
perverse
record
its
course

thats
so
typical
no

i
dont
but
one
thing
i
do
understand
youre
always
on
the
hunt
for
subjects
your
daughters
insanity
what
a
great
idea
i
love
her

martin
love
her
youre
void
of
all
feeling
you
lack
common
decency
you
know
how
to
express
yourself

you
always
have
just
the
right
words
theres
just
one
thing
you
havent
the
slightest
clue
about
life
itself
youre
a
craven
coward
but
a
genius
at
evasions
and
excuses
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
write
your
book
maybe
it
will
give
you
your
hearts
desire
your
big
breakthrough
as
a
writer
then
you
wont
have
sacrificed
your
daughter
in
vain

and
go
ahead

say
it
in
your
novels
youre
always
courting
some
god
but
let
me
tell
you
your
faith
and
your
doubt
are
very
unconvincing
all
thats
apparent
is
your
ingenuity
dont
you
think
i
know
that
then
why
go
on
why
not
do
something
respectable
instead
such
as
have
you
written
one
word
of
truth
in
your
life
as
an
author
i
dont
know

see
your
halflies
are
so
refined
that
they
look
like
truth
i
do
my
best

maybe
you
do
but
you
fall
short
i
know
youre
empty
but
clever
now
youre
trying
to
fill
your
void
with
karins
extinction
but
i
dont
see
how
youll
bring
god
into
that
itll
make
him
more
inscrutable
than
ever
can
i
ask
you
something
of
course
can
you
always
control
your
innermost
thoughts
fortunately
im
not
very
complex
my
world
is
very
simple

quite
clear
and
human
still
youve
wished
karin
would
die
only
you
could
think
such
a
thing
can
you
swear
youve
never
thought
of
it
it
would
be
logical
you
know
that
her
case
is
hopeless
and
that
both
your
suffering
is
pointless
she
might
as
well
be
dead
you
are
grotesque
that
depends
entirely
on
your
point
of
view
im
powerless
i
can
only
stand
by
and
watch
as
she
is
transformed
into
a
poor

tormented
animal
let
me
tell
you
something
when
i
was
in
switzerland

i
decided
to
kill
myself
i
hired
a
car
and
found
a
cliff
i
set
out
calmly
it
was
afternoon

the
valley
was
already
in
darkness
i
was
empty

no
fear

no
regrets

no
expectations
i
aimed
the
car
at
the
cliff

stepped
on
the
gas
and
stalled

stopping
dead
the
transmission
went
out

you
see
the
car
slid
on
the
gravel
and
came
to
a
halt
front
wheels
over
the
edge
i
crawled
out
of
the
car

trembling
i
leaned
against
a
rock
across
the
road
i
sat
gasping
for
breath
for
hours
why
are
you
telling
me
this
to
tell
you
i
no
longer
have
any
pretense
to
keep
up
the
truth
wont
bring
catastrophe
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
karin
i
think
it
does
from
the
void
within
me

something
was
born
that
i
cant
touch
or
name
a
love
for
karin

and
minus
one
day
i
may
tell
you
about
it
i
dare
not
do
it
now
but
if
but
if

the
way
im
hoping
lets
leave
it
for
now

rain

and
the
other
it
cant
go
on
the
hatred
what
hatred
i
didnt
do
it
of
my
own
free
will
a
voice
told
me
what
to
do
the
voice
told
you
to
read
my
diary
it
also
told
you
to
tell
martin
what
you
read
ive
done
worse
than
that
much
worse
i
tried
to
resist

but
i
couldnt
get
away
i
was
forced
to
do
it
when
was
this
poor
little
minus
i
just
dont
understand
try
to
stay
calm

karin
and
then
the
room
with
the
people
waiting
those
good

brightfaced
people
waiting
for
the
door
to
open
for
god
to
come
to
them
then
the
voices
start
and
i
have
to
do
as
they
say
i
cant
make
sense
of
it
all
is
it
really
just
my
illness
its
so
horrible
to
see
your
own
confusion
and
understand
it
i
want
to
apologize
to
you
ive
always
had
a
guilty
conscience
about
you

so
i
turned
away
it
makes
me
sick
to
think
of
the
life
i
sacrificed
to
my
socalled
art
i
first
became
successful
around
the
time
your
mother
died
it
meant
more
to
me
than
her
death
i
was
secretly
rejoicing

yet
i
loved
your
mother
in
my
own
confused
way
when
i
fell
ill

you
went
to
switzerland
i
couldnt
bear
that
you
had
inherited
your
mothers
illness

so
i
fled
i
had
to
finish
my
novel
is
it
any
good
you
see

karin
one
draws
a
magic
circle
around
oneself
to
keep
everything
out
that
doesnt
fit
ones
secret
games
each
time
life
breaks
through
the
circle
the
games
become
puny
and
ridiculous
so
one
draws
a
new
circle
and
builds
new
defenses
poor
little
papa
yes

little
papa

forced
to
live
in
reality

dearest
martin
im
sorry
i
was
so
mean
just
now
couldnt
you
kneel
down
next
to
me
and
put
your
hands
together
you
look
so
funny
and
conspicuous
sitting
there
i
know
you
dont
believe
but
for
my
sake

martin
hold
her
legs
calm
down

karin
i
was
frightened
but
the
god
that
came
out
was
a
spider
he
came
towards
me
and
i
saw
his
face
it
was
a
terrible

stony
face
he
crawled
up
and
tried
to
force
himself
into
me
but
i
defended
myself
the
whole
time
i
saw
his
eyes
they
were
cold
and
calm
when
he
couldnt
penetrate
me
he
continued
up
my
chest
up
onto
my
face
and
on
up
the
wall
i
have
seen
god
wait
by
the
jetty

well
be
there
as
soon
as
we
can
theyll
be
waiting
by
the
jetty
im
scared

papa
when
i
sat
holding
karin
down
in
the
wreck
reality
burst
open
reality
burst
open
and
i
tumbled
out
its
like
in
a
dream
anything
can
happen
i
cant
live
in
this
new
world
yes

you
can
but
you
must
have
something
to
hold
on
to
what
would
that
be
a
god
give
me
some
proof
of
god
you
cant

yes

i
can
but
you
have
to
listen
carefully
i
can
only
give
you
a
hint
of
my
own
hope
its
knowing
that
love
exists
for
real
in
the
human
world
a
special
kind
of
love

i
suppose
all
kinds

minus
the
highest
and
the
lowest

the
most
absurd
and
the
most
sublime
all
kinds
of
love
the
longing
for
love
longing
and
denial
trust
and
distrust
so
love
is
the
proof
i
dont
know
if
love
is
proof
of
gods
existence
or
if
love
is
god
himself
for
you

love
and
god
are
the
same
that
thought
helps
me
in
my
emptiness
and
my
dirty
despair
tell
me
more

papa
suddenly
the
emptiness
turns
into
abundance
and
despair
into
life
its
like
a
reprieve

minus
from
a
death
sentence
papa

if
it
is
as
you
say
then
karin
is
surrounded
by
god

since
we
love
her
can
that
help
her
i
believe
so
would
you
mind
if
i
go
for
a
run
off
you
go

ill
make
dinner

fantastic
read
some

have
you

had
feelings
for
a
nun
there

i
could
take

this
robe
so
she
could
see
how
strong
i
am
well

bring
her
to
our
next
wrestling
match
then
ill

an
idea

my
recreation

mean

yes
they
may

the
appearance
of
riches

beneath
the
clothes

find
a
man
and
beneath
a
man
we
find
his
nucleus
nucleus

dont

guys
just
looked
at
you

real
douche
well

win
the
battle
jam
this
week
and
you
can
fight
him
yourself
because
i
cant
go
on
living
a
lie
earth
to
steven
im
a
friar
im
not
for
that
world
the
orphans

they
need
me

and
i
have
forsaken
them
i
got
no
groceries
for
breakfast
because
of
you
im
sick
of
hearing
about
your
stupid
orphans
what
did
you
just
say
i
hate
orphans
say
it
again
to
my
face

i
hate
them
i
hate
all
the
orphans
in
the
whole
world
im
not
listening
to
you
you
only
believe
in
science

thats
probably
why
we
never
win
we
never
win
because
you
are
fat
buenos
d�as

sister
so

what
you
cooking
breakfast
ignacio

you
have
a
responsibility
to
these
children
well

where
have
you
been
ive
been
gone
because
i
had
a
lot
of
churchy
opportunities
lately
outside
of
the
orphanage
like
what
where
were
you
last
night
to
tell
you
the
truth

i
went
to
a
wrestling
match
you
went
to
watch
a
wrestling
match
kind
of
you
are
a
man
of
the
cloth
lucha
libre

its
a
sin
because
those
men
fight
for
vanity
for
money
for
false
pride
yes

its
terrible

terrible
but
is
it
always
a
sin
to
fight
lf
you
fight
for
something
noble
or
for
someone
who
needs
your
help
only
then
will
god
bless
you
in
battle
you
must
pray
for
forgiveness
excuse
me

ignacio
precious
father
why
have
you
given
me
this
desire
to
wrestle
and
then
made
me
such
a
stinky
warrior
have
i
focused
too
much
on
my
boots
and
all
my
fame
and
my
stretchy
pants
wait
a
second
maybe
you
want
me
to
fight
and
give
everything
i
win
to
the
little
ones
who
have
nothing
so
they
can
have
better
foods
and
a
better
life
yeah

maybe
that
okay

if
i
win
tonight
at
the
battle
jam
i
will
know
that
you
bless
my
mission
and
that
you
want
me
to
be
a
wrestling
servant
of
you
i
smell
cookies
flame
flame
no

no

no
no

no

no

no

no
roll

you
fool
flame

flame

flame
yes

its
true
i
am
nacho

the
luchador
who
maybe
you
have
seen
me
on
tv
no

this
is
forbidden
i
knew
it
he
is
not
a
man
of
god
i
will
fight
the
seven
strongest
men
in
town
maybe
the
world
and
i
will
win
because
our
heavenly
father
will
be
in
the
ring
with
me
and
he
and
i
will
win

pesos
and
with
it
i
will
buy
the
orphans
a
big
bus
to
go
on
field
trips
to
parks
and
places
like
that
im
serious
nipple
twist
you
cant
win
them
all
where
are
you
going
there
is
no
place
for
me
in
this
world

chanchito
i
dont
belong
out
there
and
i
dont
belong
in
here
so
im
going
into
the
wilderness
probably
to
die
well

you
might
need
this
my
mother
gave
it
to
me
before
she
died
it
was
her
lucky
machete

you
can
have
it
i
hope
to
see
you
again

little
chancho
maybe
in
the
next
life
how
did
you
find
me
here
i
saw
you
from
the
village
i
have
some
news
silencio

that
i
must
have

ago
in
the
wilderness
but
you
are

ill
be
fighting

great
ramses
i
know
you
dont
like
wrestling
but
know
that
i
am
leaving
all
my
monies
to
the
orphans
and
if
i
die
in
the
ring

that
i
always
loved
you
as
a
brother
in
god
ps

lf
we
didnt
end
up
taking
our
vows
of
celibacy
we

maybe

ni�os

vertebrae
kick

i
did
it
our
sun
is
dying
mankind
faces
extinction
seven
years
ago

the
icarus
project
sent
a
mission
to
restart
the
sun
but
that
mission
was
lost
before
it
reached
the
star
sixteen
months
ago

i

robert
capa

and
a
crew
of
seven
left
earth
frozen
in
a
solar
winter
our
payload
a
stellar
bomb
with
the
mass
equivalent
to
manhattan
island
our
purpose
to
create
a
star
within
a
star
eight
astronauts
strapped
to
the
back
of
a
bomb
my
bomb
welcome
to
icarus
ii
icarus
yes

dr

searle
please
refilter
the
observation
room
portal
filter
up
or
down

dr

searle
down
icarus

how
close
is
this
to
full
brightness
at
this
distance
of

million
miles
you
are
observing
the
sun
at

percent
of
full
brightness
two
percent
can
you
show
me

percent
four
percent
would
result
in
irreversible
damage
to
your
retinas
however

you
could
observe

percent
for
a
period
of
not
longer
than

seconds
all
right

icarus

im
gonna
reset
the
filter
to

percent
well

its
invigorating
its
like
taking
a
shower
in
light
you
lose
yourself
a
little

like
a
flotation
tank
actually

no
look

what
is
it

beef
if
you
dont
like
it

you
take
my
shift
next
time
for
psych
tests
on
deep
space

i
ran
sensorydeprivation
trials
testing
total
darkness
on
flotation
tanks
and
the
point
about
darkness
is

you
float
in
it
you
and
the
darkness
are
distinct
from
each
other
because
darkness
is
an
absence
of
something

its
a
vacuum
but
total
light

it
envelops
you
it
becomes
you
its
very
strange

i
dont
i
recommend
it
whats
strange

searle

is
that
youre
the
psych
officer
and
im
clearly
a
lot
saner
than
you
are
all
right

if
no
ones
gonna
say
it

im
going
to
the
solar
wind
reading
is
much
higher
than
wed
anticipated
at
this
distance
for
the
moment
we
can
still
send
package
messages
back
highfrequency
bursts
will
rise
above
interference
and
the
moon
stations
will
be
able
to
pick
them
up
but
its
possible
that
within

hours
we
wont
be
able
to
communicate
at
all
probable
well
finally
be
on
our
own
were

million
miles
from
earth

id
say
were
already
on
our
own
come
on

guys

we
were
expecting
this
no
great
drama

were
flying
into
the
dead
zone
seven
days
sooner
than
we
thought
but
if
any
of
you
are
planning
on
sending
a
final
message
home
you
should
do
it
now
well

mom
and
dad
i
hope
youre
proud
of
your
son
saving
mankind
and
so
on
by
the
time
you
get
this
message

ill
be
in
the
dead
zone
it
came
a
little
sooner
than
we
thought
but
this
means
that
you
wont
be
able
to
send
a
message
back
so
i
just
wanted
to
let
you
know
that
i
dont
need
the
message
because
i
know
everything
you
wanna
say
just
remember
it
takes
eight
minutes
for
light
to
travel
from
sun
to
earth
which
means
youll
know
weve
succeeded
about
eight
minutes
after
we
deliver
the
payload
all
you
have
to
do
is
look
out
for
a
little
extra
brightness
in
the
sky
so

if
you
wake
up
one
morning

and
its
a
particularly
beautiful
day
youll
know
we
made
it
im
signing
out
and
ill
see
you
in
a
couple
of
years
icarus

dial
it
down
a
little

will
you
yes

corazon
captain
im
guessing
youve
been
talking
to
searle
so

do
you
have
that
report
for
me
yeah
the
o
productivity
is
good

in
fact

if
anything

were
overproducing
it
will
trail
off
dramatically
when
we
get
nearer
but
in
truth

we
have
the
reserves
to
make
it
there
and
a
quarterway
back
youre
thinking
about
icarus
i
well

whatever
it
was
that
tripped
them
up
i
dont
think
it
was
a
lack
of
oxygen
not
on
the
outward
journey

at
any
rate
mace

what
are
you
doing
come
on
fuck

this
work

i
supposed
to
tell
you
about

childhood

first
capa

its
me

im
the
one
apologizing

all
right
was
that
the
apology
yeah
consider
it
accepted

okay
it
was
a
sequence
of
contact
reports
on
the
topleft
shield
quadrant
which

by


had
turned
into
a
minor
asteroid
storm
none
bigger
than
a
raindrop
but
we
had

punctures
and
a
secondary
contact
to
the
engine
compartment
took
three
alpha
shifts
to
patch
it
up
lost
a
little
vapor

nothing
serious

watched

mercury
twentythree
hours
ago

on
the
comms
systems
while
listening
to
your
space
music
while
scanning
the
frequencies

i
heard
a
transmission
it
appeared
as
we
flew
into
the
dark
side
of
mercury
the
iron
content
of
the
planet
is
acting
as
an
antenna
theres
high
background

but
the
signal
is
clear
enough

yes

harvey

its
the
icarus
i
that
signal
is
their
distress
beacon
thats

not
impossible
because
you
can
hear
it
theyre
still
alive
we
dont
know
but
they
could
be

oxygen
is
selfreplenishing
water
is
recycled
they
have
the
solar
power
they
need
what
about
food
their
supplies
couldnt
last
that
depends
they
had
stock
to
cover
eight
people
for
three
years
thats
a
fouryear
shortfall

hell
of
a
diet
we
dont
know
what
happened
to
icarus
i
there
might
have
been
an
accident
there
might
not
have
been
eight
people
to
feed
captain

do
we
know
where
they
are
well
done

capa

that
is
the
question
please
plot
our
trajectory
following
the
slingshot
around
mercury
now
plot
the
source
of
the
icarus
i
beacon
jesus

they
almost
made
it
thats
why
no
one
picked
up
the
signal
until
now
it
was
lost
in
the
background
light
and
noise
were
gonna
pass
right
by
them
within

or

thousand
miles
can
anyone
survive
if
the
shield
is
intact
well
be
able
to
see
them
id
need
to
look
at
all
of
this
pretty
carefully

very
carefully
but
if
i
had
to
make
a
guess
right
now

id
say
we
could
adjust
our
trajectory
we
could
fly
straight
to
them
but
were
not
gonna
do
that
just
to
make
it
absolutely
clear

theres
no
way
were
gonna
do
that
do
i
have
to
spell
it
out
for
you
we
have
a
payload
to
deliver
to
the
heart
of
our
nearest
star
were
doing
it
because
that
star
is
dying
and
if
it
dies

we
die
everything
dies
so
that
is
our
mission

there
is
nothing
literally
nothing

more
important
than
completing
our
mission

end
of
story
hes
right

hes
right

of
course
im
right
is
anyone
here
seriously
considering
otherwise
may
i
put
a
counter
argument
no
it
would

of
course
be
absurd
to
alter
our
trajectory
to
assist
the
crew
of
the
icarus
i
even
if
we
knew
that
some
or
even
all
of
that
crew
are
still
alive
their
lives
are
expendable
when
seen
in
the
context
of
our
mission
as
are
our
own
lives
exactly

however
there
is
something
onboard
the
icarus
i
that
may
be
worth
the
detour
as
you
pointed
out

mace

we
have
a
payload
to
deliver
a
payload

singular
now

everything
about
the
delivery
and
effectiveness
of
that
payload
is
entirely
theoretical
simply
put
we
dont
know
if
its
gonna
work
but
what
we
do
know
is
this
if
we
had
two
bombs

wed
have
two
chances
youre
assuming
wed
be
able
to
pilot
icarus
i
yes

which
is
assuming
that
whatever
stopped
them
wasnt
a
fault
or
a
damage
to
the
spacecraft
yes

its
a
lot
of
assumptions
its
a
risk
assessment
the
question
is
does
the
risk
of
a
detour
outweigh
the
benefits
of
an
extra
payload
well
have
a
vote

no

no
no

we
wont
we
are
not
a
democracy
were
a
collection
of
astronauts
and
scientists
so
were
gonna
make
the
most
informed
decision
available
to
us
made
by
you

by
any
chance
made
by
the
person
best
qualified
to
understand
the
complexities
of
a
payload
delivery
our
physicist
okay

icarus

run
the
math
on
the
successful
delivery
of
the
payload
okay

payload
delivery
point
reached
detach
the
payload
stellar
bomb
initiated
and
detached
crew
and
living
section
have
four
minutes
to
clear
and
commence
homeward
journey
and
four
minutes
after
separation

boosters
automatically
fire
payload
boosters
will
automatically
fire
after
fourminute
delay
entering
coronal
hole
in
south
polar
cap
magnetic
field
structure
open
temperature
reliability
of
projection
has
dropped
below

percent
remaining
projection
is
not
open
to
useful
speculation
variables
infinite
accuracy
unknown
thats
the
problem
right
there
between
the
boosters
and
the
gravity
of
the
sun
the
velocity
will
be
so
great
space
and
time
will
become
smeared
together
everything
will
distort

everything
will
be
unquantifiable
you
have
to
come
down
on
one
side
or
the
other
i
need
a
decision

its
not
a
decision

its
a
guess
its
like
flipping
a
coin
and
asking
me
to
decide
whether
itll
be
heads
or
tails
weve
mined
all
earths
fissile
materials
for
this
bomb
theres
not
gonna
be
another
payload
the
one
we
carry
is
our
last
chance
our
last
best
hope
searles
argument
is
sound
two
last
hopes
are
better
than
one
slingshot
complete
icarus
leaving
mercury
orbit
good
dream
the
surface
of
the
sun
only
dream
i
ever
have
every
time
i
shut
my
eyes
its
always
the
same
maybe
you
should
talk
to
dr

searle
about
that
see
if
he
can
help
you
out
i
just
wanted
to
let
you
know
i
think
you
made
the
right
decision
but
i
do
get
the
alarm

whats
going
on
i
screwed
up
its
not
you

its
my
responsibility
we
shouldnt
be
straying

trey

cut
to
it
in
order
to
change
the
route

i
had
to
manually
override
icarus
so
i
made
all
the
calculations
myself

and
i
double
and
triplechecked
them
they
all
worked
out
so
i
set
the
new
coordinates
and
put
us
on
our
way
whats
the
problem
the
trajectory
is
wrong
the
trajectory
is
good
but
it
changes
our
angle
of
approach
to
the
sun
by

degrees
you
didnt
reset
the
shields
to
the
new
angle
jesus
christ

trey
i
forgot
my
head
was
full
of
velocities
and
fuel
calculations
and
a
million
different
i
fucked
up

all
right
people
do
shit
they
get
stressed
and
fuck
up
i
fucked
up
the
fact
is

were
still
alive
a
hole
hasnt
burnt
in
the
side
of
the
ship
we
dont
have
a
degree
climate
so

whats
the
actual
damage
we
dont
know
icarus
tried
to
reset
the
shields
independently
when
the
alarm
triggered
but
all
the
sensors
up
there
are
burned
out
so
we
have
no
idea
of
the
state
of
the
affected
area
only
way
were
gonna
know
is
if
we
go
out
there
ill
get
suited
up
its
a
twoman
job
as
second

youre
not
going

youre
gonna
be
fine
okay

icarus
im
gonna
be
taking
control
for
a
while
okay

cassie

im
gonna
be
cutting
speed
im
gonna
rotate
us
so
the
damage
is
facing
away
from
the

do
we
understand

other
yes

cassie
rotate
by
that
much

were
gonna
lose
comm
towers
three
and
four
well

its
a
good
thing
we
dont
need
them

then
we
dont
need
them
now

were
gonna
need
them
to
go
home
well
cross
that
bridge
when
we
come
to
it
in
the
meantime

im
gonna
try

i
dont

any
of
us
are
about
to
question
that
diagnosis
as
second

i
am
now
the
captain
of

ii
thanks
both
to
kaneda
and
capa

our
shields
are
intact
as
is
the
payload
but
the
oxygen
garden
is
totally
destroyed
in
addition

a
large
amount
of
o
was
burned
in
the
fire
as
it
stands
now
we
dont
have
enough
oxygen
reserves
to
get
us
to
our
payload
delivery
point
let
alone
to
survive
the
return
journey
so
cancel
the
tickertape
parade
we
now
have
no
choice
but
to
rendezvous
with
icarus
i
if
were
gonna
complete
the
mission
the
icarus
i
is
our
only
hope
technically

he
made
a
mistake
what
are
you
trying
to
say

cory
harvey
said
theres
not
enough
oxygen
to
get
us
to
the
delivery
point
there
just
isnt
enough
oxygen
to
get
all
of
us
there
are
you
suggesting
we
let
trey
kill
himself
and
in
any
case
trey
wouldnt
be
enough
we
need
to
lose
two
more
three
out
of
seven

thats
a
lot
of
short
straws
capa

its
me
its
different
being
afraid
that
you
wont
make
it
back
home
and
then
knowing
that
you
wont
our
survival
depends
on
what
we
can
salvage
from
icarus
i
were
gonna
die
out
here
like
the
other
crew
i
know
it
are
you
scared
when
the
stellar
bomb
is
triggered
very
little
will
happen
at
first
and
then
a
spark
will
pop
into
existence
and
it
will
hang
for
an
instant

hovering
in
space

and
then
it
will
split
into
two
and
those
will
split
again
and
again
and
again
detonation
beyond
all
imagining
a
big
bang
on
a
small
scale
a
new
star
born
out
of
a
dying
one
i
think
itll
be
beautiful
no

im
not
scared
i
am
searle

capa

theyre
waiting
for
you
okay

lets
go
be
careful

watch
your
step
cassie

are
you
getting
this
on
the
feed
getting
what
the
air

its
full
of
dust
human
skin
eighty
percent
of
all
dust
is
human
skin
no
lights
no
no
surprise
anyone
afraid
of
the
dark
we
should
split
up
im
not
sure
thats
such
a
good
idea
yeah

probably
right
might
get
picked
off
one
at
a
time
by
aliens
icarus
i
is
a
big
ship

we
cant
search
it
effectively
in
one
group
okay

youre
right
mace

head
up
for
the
flight
deck

see
if
you
cant
get
her
to
fly
searle

check
the
social
area
and
the
sleeping
quarters
capa

aim
for
the
payload
ill
check
the
garden
lets
keep
in
contact

guys
you
gotta
see
this

seven
years
of
unchecked
growth
can
you
see
this
its
an
ecosystem
working
beautifully
after
all
this
time
you
seeing
this
readout

o

everybody
cory

look
at
the
ferns
thats
strange
subsystems
are
fine

solar
harvest
is
fine
the
ship
should
be
running
except
im
getting
nothing
from
the
flight
computer
got
water
food
no
crew
no
bodies
you
can
hardly
walk

its
so
thick
i
am
pinbacker
commander
of
the
icarus
i
we
have
abandoned
our
mission
our
star
is
dying
all
our
science
all
our
hopes
our
dreams

are
foolish
in
the
face
of
this
dust

nothing
more
and
to
this
dust

we
will
return
when
he
chooses
for
us
to
die
it
is
not
our
place
to
challenge
god
okay

that
make
sense
to
anyone
transmission
code
is
six
and
a
half
years
ago
that
would
be
after
they
entered
the
noncom
zone
that
should
be
the
time
they
were
supposed
to
deliver
the
payload
payload
is
fully
operational
say
again

capa
the
payload
is
fully
operational

its
aokay
thats
great
news

looks
like
we
got
what
we
came
for
no

we
dont
go
ahead

mace
i
know
what
caused
the
distress
signal
theres
a
coolant
failure
of
some
kind

the
bottom
line
is
it
doesnt
matter
that
capa
has
his
payload
without
the
mainframe

we
cant
fly
its
been
sabotaged
we
should
never
have
gone
off
the
mission
i
have
something
to
say
found
the
crew
what
happened
they
had
an
epiphany
they
saw
the
light
they
burned
themselves
no
shit
i
suspect
the
observation
filter
is
fully
open
if
we
werent
behind
the
screen
of
icarus
ii

wed
join
them
ashes
to
ashes
stardust
to
stardust
icarus

stabilizers
what
was
that
guys

get
back
to
the
airlock

now
we
have
a
major
incident
we
are
floating
free
from
you
repeat

we
are
floating
free
all
crew
back
to
the
airlock
cassie

the
airlock
has
decoupled
we
dont
know
why
the
locking
system
on
icarus
i
is
totally
ripped
open
i
can
hold
our
position
but
we
arent
gonna
be
able
to
dock
again
theres
another
thing

guys
youve
got
a
breach

i
can
see
it

youre
losing
atmosphere
one
of
us
isnt

anyway
airlocks
destroyed

theres
only
one
suit

capas
taking
it
why
capa
the
rest
of
us
are
lower
priority
im
not
a
low
priority
youre
a
comms
officer
on
a
ship
that
has
no
communication
i
am
the
captain
the
mission
needs
a
captain
to
hold
it
together
harvey

capas
the
only
person
outside
of
icarus
who
can
operate
the
payload
there
is
no
choice
no

theres
no
choice
for
you
capa

i
order
you
to
remove
that
suit
get
out
of
the
suit
that
is
a
direct
order
i
assure
you

when
im
onboard
icarus
ii
that
ill
do
everything
within
my
power
to
what
shuttle
back
with
more
suits
the
airlock
is
ripped
in
half
once
we
break
that
seal

how
are
we
gonna
repressurize
cassie
listen

we
cant
depressurize
when
we
open
the
airlock
so
the
force
of
the
gas
is
gonna
fire
him
out

right
if
you
open
your
airlock
and
we
line
it
up
right

hell
fire
inside
and
so
will
we
without
suits
get
as
close
as
you
can

youll
have

meters
to
cover
at
minus

degrees
celsius
its
gonna
be
cold
but
well
make
it
anyone
got
any
better
ideas
copy
that
one
problem
the
computers
down
one
of
us
has
to
manually
operate
the
seal
from
inside
youre
right
so

whatever
happens

one
of
us
is
staying
behind
i
see

i
get
it
its
me

thats
what
youre
all
thinking
no

harvey
hey

capa
were
only
stardust
mace

were
lined
up
everythings
set
searle

are
you
ready
all
right

we
only
got
one
shot
at
this
harvey

keep
your
eyes
shut
and
exhale
slowly
crew
detected
in
airlock
recommend
sealing
outer
airlock
door
i
lost
harvey

i

harvey
harveys
gone

crew

breathe
get
my

get
my
hand
breathe

mace

capa
youre
okay

mace

youre
okay

mace

please

breathe
capa

are
you
all
right
yeah

yeah
lets
get
you
out
of
here
searle
were
leaving
now
were
gonna
complete
the
mission
were
all
thinking
of
you

searle
were
gonna
go
now
we
love
you
ive
been
through
icaruss
activity
file
and
i
checked
it
doublechecked
it

cory
triplechecked
it
and
its
the
same
results
in
other
words

unless
icarus
is
deleting
her
own
files

she
didnt
do
it
and
there
was
no
malfunction
on
the
airlock
hardware
which
means
the
airlock
was
decoupled
manually
cassie
and
i
were
on
the
flight
deck
and
i
was
with
capa
and
searle
and
i
think
we
can
all
assume
it
wasnt
harvey
which
leaves
one
possibility
trey
is
so
doped
up
he
can
hardly
walk
or
feed
himself
he
sleeps
for

hours
a
day

and
he
blames
himself
for
everything
why
would
he
do
it
we
dont
know
the
possibility
remains
that
it
was
him
and
we
gotta
take
that
seriously
by
doping
him
up
more
this
isnt
just
about
the
possibility
whether
he
sabotaged
the
airlock
there
is
something
else
too
when
searle
and
harvey
died

we
lost
two
breathers
if
trey
dies
well
have
the
oxygen
to
make
it
to
the
delivery
point
at
least
now
we
know
what
happened
on
icarus
i
the
same
thing
thats
happening
here

fuck
you

capa
what
are
you
trying
to
remind
us
of
our
lost
humanity
im
not
passing
any
bucks
do
it
how
thats
between
me
and
trey
well
have
a
vote
this
time

unanimous
decision
required
so
you
know
where
i
stand
what
are
you
asking
that
we
weigh
the
life
of
one
against
the
future
of
mankind
kill
him
cassie

one
night

and
we
hit
a
woman
we

off
she
died
in
a
ditch
beside
the
road

probably
hours
later
i
mean

we
couldve
helped
we
shouldve
helped

but
we
were
too
afraid
of
what
our
father
was
gonna
do
a
young
man
named
andy
mills
found
himself
putting
his
young
wife
into
the
ground
he
knows
wed
done
it

but
he
couldnt
prove
it
not
when
our
father
was
the
sheriff
and
he
was
keeping
things
quiet
so
andy
went
off
into
the
woods
and
he
did
what
ed
harley
had
done
before
him
called
on
this
thing

pumpkinhead
and
i
saw
it
kill
my
brother
and
i
went
to
andy
and
i
begged
him
to
call
it
off
but
he
couldnt

even
if
he
wanted
to
that
thing
damn
near
killed
me

too
howd
you
get
away
from
that
well

i
figured
i
was
gonna
die
anyway
i
might
as
well
take
andy
with
me
and
i
killed
him
when
he
died

that

of
someone
you

we

what
we
do
i
lost
no
time

of
course

in
telling
my
mother
all
that
i
knew
and
we
saw
ourselves
at
once
in
a
difficult
and
dangerous
position
something
must
speedily
be
resolved
upon

and
it
occurred
to
us
at
last
to
go
forth
together
and
seek
help
in
the
neighboring
hamlet
no
sooner
said
than
done

bareheaded
as
we
were
we
ran
out
at
once
in
the
gathering
evening
and
the
frosty
fog
the
hamlet
lay
not
many
hundred
yards
away
though
out
of
view

on
the
other
side
of
the
next
cove
and
what
greatly
encouraged
me
it
was
in
an
opposite
direction
from
that
whence
the
blind
man
had
made
his
appearance
and
i
shall
never
forget
how
much
i
was
cheered
to
see
the
yellow
shine
in
doors
and
windows
but
that

as
it
proved
was
the
best
of
the
help
we
were
likely
to
get
in
that
quarter
for
you
would
have
thought
men
would
have
been
ashamed
of
themselves
no
soul
would
consent
to
return
with
us
to
the
audrey
sorry
mr

talcotts

dont

housework

im
the
only
one
that
knows
how
how
long
have
you
two
lived
here
we
came
over
from
savannah
in
we
bought
this
house
from
a
brother
and
a
sister
theyd
inherited
it
a
long
time
ago

from
their
parents
lived
here
since
they
were
children
there
they
are

martin
and
grace
charming
people
but
they
fell
on
hard
times

had
to
sell
you
keep
their
picture
yes

i
like
to
pay
my
respects
to
the
memories
of
this
house
all
right

come
along
now
this
is
the
dining
room
we
only
use
about
half
of
the
rooms
the
others
are
for
bens
antique
business
what
he
couldnt
sell

we
stored
here
except
for
the
attic
that
has
crystal
and
china
and
i
keep
a
very
close
account
on
that

just
so
as
you
know
there
are
more
than

rooms
in
all
in
the
old
days

they
made
a
separate
key
for
each
room
for
the
owner

they
made
a
skeleton
key
this
will
open
every
door
this
one
is
yours
i
have
mine
now

the
pantrys
right
out
here
you
know

we
may
have
to
ask
you
to
go
into
town
now
and
then
was
there
a
mirror
here
once
i
noticed
in
the
bathrooms
also
there
are
no
mirrors
child

when
you
get
as
wornout
and
wrinkled
as
we
are
you
dont
need
any
reminding
if
you
want
a
small
one
for
your
own
purposes
whatd
you
do
with
them
put
them
away
the
boy
tells
me
you
dont
smoke
i
do
smoke

i
smoke
a
lot
and
i
enjoy
it
very
much
i
trust
that
wont
be
an
issue
it
wont
be
good

then
for
the
most
part
just
realize
that
ill
live
here
as
if
youre
not
in
residence
after
all

were
not
kin

are
your
parents
still
alive
my
mom
left
when
i
was
little

my
dad
raised
me
and
he
died
last
year
oh

my

so
you
cared
for
him
as
well
i
just
thought
i
had
more
time
you
think
too
much
about
the
time
you
have
left
you
dont
spend
it
living
be
good
to
my
husband

be
good
to
his
house
remedies
at
you
dont
see
gardens

this
back
in
new
jersey

expect
actually

its
the
garden
state
i
doubt
that
very
much
nothing
more
glorious
than
a
garden
gone
every
winter

back
every
spring
you
religious
at
all
i
try
to
keep
an
open
mind

very
good
where

my
trilliums
oh

fiddlesticks

do
me
a
blessing

child

you
run
up
to
the
attic
for
me
i
have
some
seed
packets
in
a
box
right
next
to
the
stairs
what
took
you
i
thought
the
key
opens
everything
the
key
what
key
the
key
you
gave
me

a
room
like
that
you
leave
them
just
where
you
found
them
the
house
is
theirs
just
as
much
as
ours
the
house
is
whose
whose
things
are
in
that
room
about

years
ago
there
was
a
banker
here

his
name
was
thorpe
he
made
his
fortune
cheating
the
poor
he
was
a
mean
man

he
was
a
cruel
man
it
was
him

and
his
family

and
couple
of
servants
name
of
mama
cecile
and
papa
justify
the
way
i
heard
it

old
man
thorpe

he
didnt
know
that
papa
justify
was
a
twoheaded
doctor
he
was
a
conjure
man

so
was
cecile
they
believed
in
hoodoo
that
was
their
room
they
were
famous
all
through
the
bayous
they
healed
the
sick
and
they
hurt
the
mean
but
old
thorpe

he
just
saw
them
as
help
and
he
worked
them
to
the
bone
he
abused
them
until
one
night

as
the
story
goes
there
was
a
party
it
was
the
banks
anniversary

all
the
big
mucketymucks
were
here
politicians

sugar
barons

riverboat
tycoons
there
was
a
lot
of
drinking
and
dancing
and
a
couple
of
trysts

im
sure
and
then

finally

when
it
was
time
to
say
farewell
some
of
the
guests
wanted
to
wish
goodbye
to
the
children
but
nobody
could
find
them

they
hadnt
seen
them
in
hours
so

being
all
full
of
brandy

they
made
it
a
game
lets
find
the
children
room
after
room
after
room
finally

someone
heard
music
martin
grace
and
voices
and
shouting
up
in
the
attic
from
the
devils
house
it
is
time

lord
the
servants
were
up
there
with
the
children
they
were
trying
to
teach
them
how
to
conjure
hoodoo
and
take
his
head
thorpe
went
about
insane

and
so
did
the
rest
of
the
guests
i
mean

how
long
had
this
blasphemy
been
going
on
the
children
said
it
was
their
fault

that
theyd
wanted
to
learn
but
they
werent
having
any
of
that
all
that
power
and
rage
and
insanity
the
party
was
over
it
was
a
terrible
thing
rumors
got
out

but
no
arrests

no
trial
money
had
its
way
what
happened
to
the
family
the
bank
went
under
thorpe
shot
his
wife
to
death

and
then
turned
the
gun
on
himself
people
in
the
bayou
say
it
was
justify
and
ceciles
revenge
the
children
stayed
here
till
but
they
never

ever

told
us
why
that
room
was
locked
or
why
there
were
no
mirrors
in
the
whole
house
now
we
know
you
see
them
in
the
mirrors
the
servants
ive
gone
and
read
some
hoodoo
books

and
they
say
so
i
made
a
big
circle
of
it
around
the
whole
house
you
cant
expect
me
to
believe
you
see
ghosts
in
your
mirrors
the
ghosts
are
here
now
but
whatever
they
did
to
him
i
am
not
going
to
let
them
do
it
to
me
like
all
the
rest
of
them
thats
some
superstitious
wife
you
got
there

she
thinks
you

ghosts
in
the
attic

fine
that
brick
dust
at
the
door

how
does
it
work
you
lay
a
line
down
nobody
that
means
you
harm
can
cross
it
its
how
you
tell
who
your
enemies
are
its
like
hypnotism

right
suggestion
and
when
this
stuff
works

its
because
someone
believes
it
works
and
if
you
thought

you
know
magic
made
you
sick
you
might
believe
in
a
magic
cure

right
even
though
its
all
in
your
head
somebody
been
working
roots
on
you
say
i
knew
someone
who
believed
hed
been
crossed

crossed

he
believe
he
could
be
uncrossed
whats
the
nature
of
his
condition
he
cant
speak

barely
moves

he
had
a
stroke
but
he
seems
to
think
someone
else
made
him
that
way
and
you
want
to
know
what
happened
to
him
you
went
in
there

you
actually
went
in
are
you
out
of
your
mind
come
on

havent
you
ever
heard
of
psychosomatic
treatment
yeah

but
this
is
not
that
how
much
of
a
patients
recovery
depends
on
his
believing
he
can
what
recovery
this
is
hospice
youre
just
supposed
to
help
this
guy
die
he
believes
in
this
stuff
so
what
who
is
he

been
nothing
but
blood
and
tears
that
the
last
owners
were
some
rich
brother
and
sister
crazy
people

supposedly
they
died
of
strokes
right
after
they
sold
the
place
maybe
they
found
something
they
shouldnt
maybe
now
ben
did

too
it
may
be
their
mess
in
that
room
but
aint
no

a
spell

that
old
man

you
i
mean

it
cant
hurt
you
if
you
dont

then
i
suggest
you

that
house
before

for
gods

this
is
insane

the
man
had
a
stroke
that
isnt
what
he

youre
gonna
take
him
away
from
her
from
his
own
wife

to
them
this
music

i

this
music
you
sure
this
is
a
good
idea
excuse
me

maam
we
heard
the
music

your
record

i
was
wondering
theres
no
record
for
anyone
here
how
about
records
by
a
man
named
justify
how
do
you
know
that
name
who
sent
you
who
else
is
in
here
someone
else
in
here
its
just
me

maam
stop
now

dont
you
go
touching
do
you
know
a
record
called
the
conjure
of
sacrifice
because
i
have
it

if
you
do
you
had
that

you
wouldnt
say
so
you
do
know
it
the
strongest
conjuration
of
all

they
say
justify
discovered
it
but
he
got
killed
before
he
learned
to
work
it
him
and
his
poor
wife
both

its
never
been
found
what
does
it
do
it
keeps
you
from
dying
not
forever

but
for
a
while
you
have
to
sacrifice
somebody
and
take
the
years
that
they
have
left
hurry
up
hes
alone
with
her
hang
on

caroline
wait
shit
now
you
got
me
spooked
if
i
get
proof

whatever
you
need
she
meant
so
much
to
them

her
being
here
i
know
it
wasnt
for
long

but
they
really
loved
her
why
do
you
say
that
its
in
their
wills
as
long
as
humanity
has
existed

there
have
been
others
among
us
theyre
human

yet
they
have
abilities
beyond
those
of
ordinary
men
witches

sorcerers

shapeshifters
the
others
are
as
varied
as
stars
in
the
sky
the
others
are
soldiers
in
the
eternal
war
the
struggle
between
dark
and
light
light
others
protected
mankind
from
the
dark
others
who
plagued
and
tortured
humans
legend
tells
of
a
day
when
the
two
armies
met
on
a
bridge
geser

lord
of
the
light
and
zavulon

general
of
the
darkness

faced
each
other
and
neither
one
would
give
way
and
so
began
a
great
battle
bloody
and
merciless
zavulon
gloried
in
the
slaughter
but
lord
geser
wept
as
the
screams
of
the
dying
reached
heaven
geser
realized
the
armies
were
equally
matched
and
he
knew
that
unless
the
fighting
stopped
every
last
soul
would
perish
so
he
stopped
the
battle
thus

the
forces
of
light
and
darkness
forged
a
truce
geser
spoke
for
the
light
and
zavulon
spoke
for
the
darkness
and
these
things
were
agreed
no
one
could
be
forced
to
good
or
evil
without
choosing
freely
the
soldiers
of
light
would
be
called
night
watch
making
sure
dark
others
obeyed
the
truce
and
the
soldiers
of
darkness
would
be
called
day
watch

to
do
the
same
and
so
the
balance
would
be
kept
for
centuries
to
come
but
one
day

an
other
would
come
more
powerful
than
any
before
him
like
all
others

he
would
have
to
choose
between
light
and
dark
and
his
choice
would
change
the
balance
forever

anything
unusual
over
the

in
the
next

hours
gotcha
tornado
warning
for
moscow
legends
of
byzantium
shes
the
virgin

the
girl
you
saw
long
ago

when
the
world
was
young
there
was
a
virgin
in
byzantium
she
was
a
good
woman

pure
and
kind
and
someone
cursed
her
wherever
she
went

misfortune
followed
when
she
held
a
candle

it
went
out
if
she
petted
a
puppy

it
died
when
a
bird
ate
from
her
hand

it
dropped
to
the
ground
in
houses
she
visited

children
died
the
force
of
the
curse
opened
a
vortex
of
damnation
around
her
and
with
it

the
first
forces
of
darkness
were
born
into
the
world
warriors
of
light
rose
up
to
fight
them
and
the
great
battle
between
light
and
dark
began
all
because
one
human
cursed
another
legend
says
that
one
day
the
virgin
shall
again
appear
again
she
shall
be
cursed
but
this
time
her
appearance
heralds
the
last
battle
for
when
the
virgin
returns

the
final
battle
between
good
and
evil
shall
begin
and
the
balance
will
be
broken
forever
the
great
other
will
appear

if
he
takes
the
side
of
light

light
will
triumph
but
wise
men
say
he
will
choose
the
darkness
for
it
is
easier
for
a
man
to
destroy
the
light
inside
himself
than
to
defeat
the
darkness
all
around
him
the
prophecy
is
coming
true
its
begun

the

middle
of
the
night
wondering
where

and
then
i
remember
i
know
you
miss
him

too

but
its
really
been
hardest
on
me

rattling
on

if
you
dont
vent
your
emotions
they
just
well
up
inside
of
you
and
burst
out
the
harder
you
try

the
harder
it
all
gets
till

it
off
anymore

burden
sometimes
your

so
big
and
then

say
to
yourself
jesus

can
turn
to
religion
or

the
fuck
is
this
these
fucking
pigs
like
to
do
it
with
the
curtains
open
you
should
have
known
that

this
is
a
big
mistake
for
you

earl
almost
like
a
want
to
get
caught
on

marshall
oh

dont
fucking
do
that
i
dont
think
either

us
will
enjoy
spending
the

of

lives
on
death
row
or
a
lethal
injection
please
forgive
me
youre
a
fucking
artist
earl

i
give
you
that
dont
even
think
about
it
you
know
the
rules
now
go
upstairs
and
make
love
to
your
beautiful
wife
do
we
have
the
room

please
theres
a
thumbprint

right
there
one
his

one
hers
thats
what
it
looks
like
this
guy
has
not
been
active
for
over

years
he
always
rearranges
the
bodies

but
this
is
way
out
of
character
usually
its
much
more
romantic
arms
around
each
other

kissing
mouths
open

tongues
touching
bullets
from
straight
through
the
victims
killer
recovered
the
slugs
were
these
open
or
closed
when
you
got
here
could
be
the
work
of
a
copycat
it
has
never
been
revealed
to
the
public
that
the
killer
retrieves
the
slugs
jesus

i
was
hoping
this
guy
was
either
dead
or
in
jail
on
some
other
charge
we
checked
the
whole
neighbourhood

so
far
nobody
saw
a
thing
leaving
them
like
this
he
must
have
been
really
angry
at
them
for
some
reason
where
would
they
keep
their
vacuum
cleaner
so
i
bet
you

bucks

hawkins

there
is
no
bag
in
this
vacuum
cleaner
i
have
no
idea
what
the
hell
you
are
looking
for
he
vacuumed
the
house
and
took
the
bag
what
if
he
kills
somebody
that
didnt
have
a
vacuum
cleaner
he
wouldnt
do
that
our
best
hope
is
if
someone
in
there
saw
something
detective

and
then
ill
decide
i
dropped
out
of
school
oh
jane
okay
have
you
told
your
mother
no

i
wanted
to
talk
to
you
first
well

you
gonna
have
to
tell
her

jane

all
right
im
not
going
to
do
that
for
you
why
cant
you
sit
and
then
together

the
three
of
us

will
decide
where
itll
go
from
here
okay

but
i
thought
a
lot
about
this

college
is
a
waste
of
time
for
me
how
does
somebody
know
that

half
way
through
their
freshmen
year
you
didnt
even
go
to
college

daddy

and
you
are
successful
i
want
to
come
work
for
you
she
is
not
telling
you
everything

she
is
hiding
something
i
am
not
hiring
right
now

sweetheart
okay

but
just
listen
to
me
for
one
second
all
right
look
what
would
happen
to
the
business
if

god
forbid

something
would
happen
to
you
mom
would
probably
have
to
sell
to
strangers
now
look

i
am
willing
to
start
at
the
bottom
you
can
treat
me
like
a
regular
employee
i
just
want
to
learn
everything
there
is
to
know
about
running
the
box
business
then

when
the
time
comes
it
can
stay
in
the
family
well

thats
sweet

honey

but
you
are
not
talking
about
business

you
are
talking
about
emotion

now
get
up
in
fact

your
mother
and
i
came
this
close
to
selling
out
last
year
thats
right

and
had
we
been
offered
a
little
more
money
and
they
still
may
come
back
to
us
we
would
sell
what
would
you
do
without
the
business
im
sorry

the
man
outside
insisted
that
i
give
this
to
you
he
claims
that
youll
find
whats
inside
very
interesting
what
is
he

sunday
is
he
a
salesman
ive
never
seen
him
before
ill
just
give
him
back
to
him
and
ill
tell
him
to
call
no

sunday

sunday

come
here
jane

part
of
spending
four
years
at
college
is
to
give
yourself
a
chance
to
find
out
and
what
you
want
to
do
ill
talk
to
mom
but
i
am
not
going
back
to
school
and
where
would
you
live
to
save
money

i
would
move
back
home
but
no
rules

no
curfew

i
want
to
be
treated
as
an
adult
would
you
pay
for
rent
would
you
pay
for
food
no
dad

you
are
a
very
wealthy
man

i
think
you
can
afford
to
keep
me
sunday

would
you
show
the
gentleman
who
gave
you
the
envelope
into
the
conference
room
and
tell
him
that
i
would
meet
him
there
no
problem

mr

brooks
and

uh
what
happened
to
the
bmw

jane
a
friend
is
going
to
drive
it
up

will
be
here
next
weekend
and
get
jane
a
cab
call
your
mother
are
you
going
to
give
me
a
job
if
this
were
up
to
me

and
i
think
your
mother
will
agree
with
this

i
i
think
you
should
go
back
to
school
you
see
that

marshall
thats
why
i
didnt
want
to
do
the
dance
couple
stop
your
fucking
whining

earl

enjoyed
doing
that
couple
just
as
as
much
i
did
and
look
at
the
bright
side
he
came
to
us

he
didnt
go
to
the
cops
if
hes
trying
to
shake
us
down

we
kill
him

period
we
make
it
fun

but
well
kill
him
end
of
story
what
can
i
do
for
you

mister
lets
say
smith
okay

mr

smith
before
you
get
the
wrong
impression

mr

brooks

im
not
here
to
shake
you
down
well

then
these
are
the
only
copies
of
these
photos
and
you
have
no
others
no

i
have
other
copies
and
other
photos
and
if
anything
happens
to
me
how
did
you
find
me

mr

smith
you
are
the
man
of
the
year

mr

brooks
your
picture
is
in
the
paper
and
if
it
had
not
have
been
i
dont
know

i
dont
know
what
i
would
have
done
lucky
me
what
is
it
that
i
can
help
you
with
ive
been
watching
that
couple
for
months
yeah

they
liked
to
make
love
with
the
blinds
opened
sometimes
i
would
take
pictures
visual
aids

for
later
its
a
great
way
to
get
off

i
tell
you
that
it
was
fun

i
thought
until
i
saw
youve
killed
them
and
i
have
never
ever
felt
that
rush
like
that

ever
i
know
you
are
the
thumbprint
killer
you
have
done
this
before
what
i
want
is
for
you
to
take
me
with
you
next
time
you
kill
someone
and
id
like
that
to
be
soon
and
you
were
worried
this
was
going
to
be
unpleasant
the
answer
is
simple
just
tell
mr

smith
that
you
have
decided
never
to
kill
again
and
hell
go
away
you
enjoy
watching
me
suffer

dont
you
in
a
word

yes
where
do
you
think
he
has
the
other
pictures
he
put
them
in
a
safety
deposit
box
but
i
bet
the
box
is
at
the
bank
where
he
keeps
his
checking
account
and
the
key
its
on
his
key
chain
he
really
wants
us
to
do
this
he
is
not
going
to
the
cops
we
have
a
deal
from
the
angle
of
these
pictures
you
live
on
the
rd
floor
of
the
apartment
building
across
the
alley
from
the
couples
house
yes
or
no

mr

smith
what
time
do
you
get
home
from
work
depending
of
the
traffic
you
can
never
come
here
again
you
can
never
call
me

do
you
understand
that
yes

okay
tomorrow
night
not
tonight

tomorrow
night
at

oclock
leave
your
apartment
building
and
walk
east
i
will
pick
you
up
there
if
you
are
thinking
about
doing
anything
were
both
aware
of
the
rules

mr

smith
but
i
feel
i
must
warn
you
if
it
turns
out
that
you
enjoy
killing
it
can
become
very
addictive
it
could
ruin
your
life
i
want
to
do
this

okay
have
i
covered
everything
i
cant
think
of
anything
else
then
ill
see
you
tomorrow
night

mr

smith
weve
talked
to
our
client
and
weve
come
up
with
a
figure
that
we
feel
is
more
than
fair
we
can
have
a
check
for
that
amount
in
your
office
by

oclock
we
told
you
at
the
beginning
what
we
wanted
that
hasnt
changed
we
feel
our
offer
is
more
than
generous
i
paid
for
everything
while
we
were
together
and
now
im
being
asked
to
give
this
guy
a
bonus
for
spending
time
with
me

time
that
ive
already
paid
for
in
the
first
place
you
know
as
well
as
i
do

counselor

youre
not
going
to
get
a
million
five
oh

i
dont
know
that

no

i
well

in
fact

this
is
the
front
page
of
yesterdays
paper
hangman
escapes
after
torturing
his
victims
thorton
meeks

hang
them

is
going
well

your
client
captured
mr

meeks
come
on
tracy

is
not
a
lot
of
money
for
you

we
both
know
how
frightened
i
was
after
meeks
said
that
he
was
going
to
escape
and
come
back
and
kill
you
let
me
ask
again
our
point
is
that
meeks

or
someone
like
meeks
may
come
after
my
client
in
order
to
hurt
your
client
that
is
very
imaginative

counsellor
but
its
not
based
in
reality
at
all
jesse
lets
just
let
us
handle
this

please
tracy
jesse
you
know
what
would
make
me
feel
really
safe
right
now
if
you
got
hit
by
a
truck
and
died
well

thats
it
mr

vialo
and
i
are
leaving
you

the
safety
of
my
client

to
have
to
get
a
restraint
order
see
you
in
court
get
hit
by
a
truck
and
die
fuck
it

i
felt
good
its
not
whats
here

its
whats
not
here
thats
interesting
if
i
had
a
number

id
say
these
people
have
been
killed
by
a
ghost
the
autopsy
said
there
was
a
tiny
piece
of
plastic
in
the
female
victims
brain
its
a
dead
end

he
bags
the
gun

he
puts
a
one
gallon
plastic
freezer
bag
over
his
hand
to
his
wrists
little
bit
of
plastic
comes
out
with
the
first
slug
when
the
shells
gone
in
the
bag
were
you
looking
for
me
ive
received
the
subpena
from
your
husband
for
your
work
records
where
you
worked

date
and
times
for
the
past
two
years
hes
just
trying
to
blackmail
me

until
a
settlement

but
my
lawyers
assure
me
that
ill
go
never
to
court
i
cant
take
that
chance
almost
three
quarters
of
your
cases
are
current
so

until
youre
settling
your
divorce

im
gonna
have
to
put
you
on
a
desk
thats
also
blackmail
do
you
have
any
idea
what
this
guy
has
done
to
me
while
we
were
married

while
i
was
paying
for
everything
he
was
just
out
fucking
every
woman
he
can
get
his
hands
on
he
fucked
my
friends

he
fucked
my
cousins
he
made
me
look
like
an
idiot
and
and
what
you
cant
grow
old
as
a
woman
without
having
at
least
one
frowzy
man
in
your
life
well

i
made
him
an
offer
and
i
am
not
going
to
give
him
a
dime
more
did
you
hear
that
meeks
escaped
we
got
every
unit
looking
for
him

you
want
me
to
put
a
detail
on
you
i
think
i
can
take
care
of
myself
its
one
of
your
biggest
problems

tracy

you
dont
know
how
to
ask
for
help
what
the
fuck

what
the
fuck

what
dont
worry

if
i
were
here
to
kill
you

you
would
already
be
dead
after
you
left
today

i
realized
that
our
friendship
was
a
little
onesided
so

tomorrow
night
when
we
meet

would
you
be
so
kind
as
to
bring
all
the
pictures
and
the
memory
card
from
your
camera
that
way
we
can
like
each
other
simply
for
who
we
are
if
you
dont
show
up
i
will
presume
that
you

and
you
wouldnt
risk
a
shot
in
the
dark
where

you
been
did
you
miss
the
thrill
of
killing
what
if
these
are
stuck
closed
because
you
yanked
them
closed
which
would
mean
they

open
when
you

you
we
doing
look

doing
this
a
long
time

pen

paper
look
out
the
window
and
write
it
down
what

your
first
time
like
you
really
dont
want
to

that
much
about
me

mr

smith
no

i
dont
think
it
was
right

go
back
ok

we
are
in
for
all
the
taxes
we
pay
youd
think
theyd
make
it
more
difficult
to
hack
into
the
police
personnel
file
her
father
is
john
atwood

why
why
does
that
ring
a
bell
someone
you
did
business
with
someone
we
killed
no

not
someone
we
killed
let
me
see
here

mba
master
of
business
association
college
of
william

mary

she
has
been
a
cop
for

years
married
dr

carlson
divorced
dr

carlson

married
a
jesse
vialo
a
restaurateur

seperates
from
jesse
vialo
sued
for
support
by
jesse
vialo

seeing
seeing
a
shrink
because
of
jesse
vialo
she
has
caught
a
lot
of
people
and
look
here

this
is
not
the
first
time
she
has
been
looking
for
us
okay

here
we
are
jesse
vialo

good
looking

a
little
younger
than
she
is
younger

restaurateur
she
married
him
on
a
rebound
from
the
doctor
and
ill
bet
he
married
her
for
her
money
and
connections
just
because
the
old
men
is
rich
doesnt
mean
she
is
rich
maybe
is
one
of
the
kind
of
guys
thatd
rather
give
it
to
the
opera
what
does
she
have
to
declare
any
outside
incoming
holdings
oh

you
are
a
you
are
a
genius
the
opera
didnt
get
much
why
would
a
woman

worth

plus
million
dollars
and
probably
more
to
come
want
to
be
a
cop
i
like
that
about
her
you
are
a
such
a
fucking
snob

earl

you
like
her
because
she
is
rich
no

i
like
her
because
she
has
found
something
thats
hers
its
not
the
family
business

and
she
is
good
at
it
id
like
jane
to
find
something
thats
hers
and
that
she
could
be
good
at
thats
exactly
why
atwood
scares
the
shit
out
of
me
shes
a
cop
who
doesnt
need
the
money
and
she
is
looking
for
us
thats
one
fucking
dangerous
human
being
the
fact
that
you
are
not
wrong
just
not
makes
me
admire
her
any
less
hey

you

your

a
lot
of
political
muscle

be
that

so
thats
it
just
no
you

the
licence

they

in

you
it

the

number
these
are
the
women

meeks
steroids
weve
had
a
tap
on
his

you

im
trying
to
stitch
you
up
here
and
your
ego
can
handle
that
no

but
it
doesnt
likes
the
other
choices
because
the
fbi
is
wiring
hard
on
me
to
take
over
the
thumbprint
killer
until
meeks
is
caught

hawkins
is
with
you
nothing
personal

hawkins

ugly
mr

i
know
you
are
upset

mr

smith

and
i
am
sorry
yeah

upset
maybe
i
was
a
little
brut
back
there

but
let
me
explain
finding
someone
you
think
would
be
fun
to
kill
is
a
bit
like
hell

its
a
bit
like
falling
in
love
you
meet
a
lot
of
candidates

you
like
some
of
them
and
theyre
nice
but
they
are
not
right
and
that
special
one
comes
along
and
your
heart
it
beats
faster
and
you
know
thats
the
one
the
man
in
the
pickup
did
not
make
my
heart
beat
faster
the
man
didnt
make
your
heart
beat
faster

have
someone
in
mind

want
me
to
do
some
work

just
lets
just
see

knew
died
or
some
somebody
in
her
dorm
died
no

why
well

there
are
two
detectives
downstairs

one
of
them
is
from
palo
alto
they
want
to
ask
her
some
questions
about
a
murder
that
occurred
there
shortly
before
she
came
home
well

im
sure
if
she
was
close
to
somebody
who
was
murdered
she
would
have
said
something
i
called
roger

he
suggested
a
criminal
attorney
they
will
be
here
within
the
hour
yeah

ill
get
dressed
this
is
too
close

i
know
jane

how
well
did
you
know
philip
ramsey
he
and
i
were
in
a
couple
of
classes
together

thats
about
it
did
you
ever
drive
him
to
class
no
youve
ever
been
to
his
apartment
do
you
know
where
he
lives
which
complex
was
he
in
it
was
actually
stolen
well

that
was
interesting
you
know

i
dont
feel
so
well
i
think
you
should
lie
down

okay
i
think
she
should
lie
down
dad

im
sorry
i
didnt
say
anything
before
it
was
really
horrible

but
i
didnt
know
the
guy
that
well
and
it
happened
around
the
same
time
i
found
out
i
was
pregnant

so
just
can
i
lie
down
i
understand
i
am
going
to
go
up
with
her
now
tell
me

what
do
i
do
she
did
it
didnt
she
itll
take
the
cops
a
week
to
ten
days
to
put
their
case
together
and
then
and
then
they
will
come
back
and
arrest
her
what
are
you
going
to
do
ive
been
afraid
of
this
since
before
she
was
born
she
has
she
has
what
i
have
yes

she
does
but
youre
always
smarter
about
it

she
was
stupid
she
did
it
because
she
got
off
on
it

okay

i
understand
she
did
it
for
fun

okay

i
understand
but
why
didnt
she
think
it
through
a
hatchet

and
she
left
it
there
you
are
pretty
graphic
all
day
that
was
the
shock
of
her
making
a
mistake
what
does
she
think
i
think
i
wish
shed
remember
what
she
told
me
that
the
bmw
was
being
driven
across
the
country
by
her
friend
and
now

right

she
tells
the
cops
that
it
was
stolen
youve
always
cleaned
her
bathroom

whatever
she
did

all
her
life
its
the
bmw

as
anything
incriminating
i
hope
it
was
stolen
i
hope
she
dropped
it
at
the
bottom
of
a
very
deep
lake
do
you
think
she
knows
all
those
troubles
that
shes
in
i
think
she
thought
she
had
gotten
away
with
it
until
the
cops
showed
up
i
shouldve
listened
to
her

she
was
trying
to
tell
me
it
was
there
i
didnt
quit
school
because
i
was
pregnant
i
should
have
dug
deeper
and
where
would
you
be

but
in
exactly
the
same
place
that
you
are
in
now
its
not
your
fault

earl
part
of
your
problem
with
her
is
that
you
always
think
it
is
she
has
what
i
have

marshall

so
on
a
very
basic
level

it
is
my
fault
maybe
the
best
thing
for
her
would
be
to
let
her
go
to
jail
what
about
her
child
emma
and
i
will
help
her
raise
it
you
might
be
right
earl

you
know
just
might
be
because
if
shes
not
stopped
she
is
going
to
kill
again
and
if
she
really
wants
to
take
over
that
box
business
the
next
victim
could
be
you
i
dont
think
she
would
go
that
far
weve
received
a
counter
offer
are
you
sitting
down
yeah

go
ahead
million
dollars
my
god

you
got
to
be
kidding
me
he
cant
get
that

can
he
no

no

no

my
sense
of
it
is
that
by
asking
for
they
are
hoping
youll
settle
anywhere
between

and
can
you
stall
them
no

they
know
you
want
this
done
quickly
so
theyre
going
to
expect
a
quick
counter
offer
look

i
need
two
days

just
wait

days

tell
them
that
its
a
big
number
and
that
i
have
to
think
about
it
oh

and
that
picture
that
he
wanted
tell
him
i
couldnt
find
it
yes

mr

brooks
before
you
open
your
mouth
be
very
sure
this
is
the
right
i
will
never
be
sure
you
get
pissed
at
me
because
im
always
the
one
argueing
to
go
ahead
and
do
murder
not
this
time

earl

this
is
your
decision
i
know
whats
wrong

i
know
in
my
heart
its
wrong
then
dont
do
it
go
with
mr

smith
and
let
it
finish
that
and
let
the
police
put
jane
in
jail

hopefully
that
will
save
her
and
we
can
happily
go
on
with
our
tortured
lives
thats
exactly
what
i
want
to
do
thats
exactly
what
i
should
do

the
thing
is

she
is
my
daughter
and
i
love
her
im
going
home
cancel
everything
for
the
rest
of
the
day
if
you
need
me
need
me

sunday

ill
be
in
my
studio
call
me
there
i
probably
wont
pick
up

so
just
leave
a
message
ill
try
to
not
bother
you
the
thing
that
bothers
me
about
this

besides
the
fact
that
we
are
not
prepared
and
a
multitude
of
other
things

is
what
does
mr

smith
do
when
hes
walking
west
tonight
and
you
dont
show
up

that
little
freak
will
flip
out
i
will
take
care
of
it
on
the
way
to
the
airport
what
are
we
doing
what
are
we
doing
what
are
we
doing
you
sound
like
a
whinyass
kid
we
are
playing
a
hunch

we
have
been
following
this
guy
all
day
he
is
boring

ok
and
everything
we
run
on
him
comes
out
clean
well

if
it
didnt

it
wouldnt
be
called
a
hunch
meeks

hes
the
guy
we
should
be
looking
for

meeks
look
where
please

tell
me
look

everyone
knows
who
meeks
is
and
is
looking
for
him
the
chiropractor
was
the
last
link
to
his
old
life
that
i
know
we
are
going
to
find
him
now

somebody
will
turn
him
in

we
are
going
to
troop
over
him
at
a
bus
stop
on
the
other
hand

nobody
knows
who
the
thumbprint
killer
is
or
where
he
is
however

i
have
a
fucking
hunch
that
this
guy

bafford

does
ive
got

days
to
play
that
hunch
so
if
you
think
you
are
wasting
your
time
with
me

then
id
be
happy
to
do
it
alone
i
had
a
fight
with
my
wife
this
morning
whats
your
problem
my
husband
wants

million
dollars
here
you
are

sir
god
grant
me
the
serenity
to
accept
the
things
that
i
cannot
change
courage
to
change
the
things
that
i
can
and
wisdom
to
know
the
difference
living
one
day
at
a
time

enjoying
one
moment
at
a
time
not
able
to
meet
do
it
same
time
tomorrow
good
for
you

asshole
remember
me
can
you
step
out
of
the
car

please
i
want
to
talk
to
you
so

mr
bafford

what
is
it
that
you
have
to
tell
me
what
do
you
mean
i
dont
have
anything
to
tell
you
really
because
i
was
driving
around
and
i
suddenly
got
this
feeling
that
you
had
something
to
tell
me
about
the
murders
nothing
oh

that
is
disappointing
because

when
i
left
after
we
we
talked
last
time
i
thought
i
had
missed
a
clue
that
was
right
in
front
of
me
that
could
solve
this
whole
case
i
dont
know
why
you
would
feel
that
can
you
tell
me
that
you
are
an
amateur
potterer

that
you
like
to
make
bowls
and
vases
i
told
you
that
my
hobby
was
photography
and
not
pottery
oh

maybe

maybe
that
was
it
flight
attendant
upstairs
said
that
the
victims
liked
to
keep
their
bedroom
curtains
open
when
they
had
sex
can
i
see
some
of
those
photos
you
took
of
that
couple
you
are
harassing
me

detective
atwood
you
knew
very
well
that
im
not
a
potterer
and
i
dont
have
any
pictures
so
my
feeling
is
that
your
feeling
is
wrong
and
you
should
just
move
your
car
and
let
me
go
home
whats
your
job
here
what
what
do
you
do
i
am
a
mechanical
engineer
you
got
to
be
really
smart
for
that

dont
you
then
be
smart

mr

bafford
because
you
lied
to
me

right
there
at
the
end
ill
be
watching
you
when
you
want
to
tell
me
the
truth

you
have
to
get
in
touch
with
me
see
you
later
alligator
captain
lister
got
us
the
search
warrant
for
meeks
doctor
goddamnit

this
guy
knows
something
almost
told
me

and
then
something
happened
you
think
he
did
it
i
dont
think
its
quite
that
simple
do
you
want
to
call
for
backup
yeah

we
should
be
ready
for
anything
in
fact

get
a
k
canine
unit
and
a
chopper
i
dont
have
the
energy
to
chase
this
guy
if
he
decides
to
run
this
is
the
police

the
house
is
surrounded
alvin
griffin

fold
your
hands
on
top
of
your
head
clear
meeks
was
a
steroid
freak
this
was
ususally
full

its
empty
now
you
think
meeks
has
alvin
with
him
he
thinks
alvin
turned
him
in

on
me
hawkins

meet
alvin
griffin
thats
understandable
youve
never
killed
for
this
reason
before

the
feeling
will
pass
its
the
whole
thing

marshall
if
i
could
find
a
way
to
just
end
it
all
disappear

where
theres
absolutely
no
trace
of
me
because
eventually
i
will
get
caught
doing
this
that
would
be
very
embarrassing
for
me
and
emma
and
jane
so
i
have
been
thinking
is
there
a
way
that
mr

smith
could
kill
me
and
make
me
disappear
rule
no
mr

smith
is
not
smart
enough
to
do
that
i
know
that
no
there
is
no
reason

if
you
are
careful

to
believe
you
will
ever
get
caught
i
know
that
i
will
have
to
plan
it
for
mr
smith
but
i
think
i
think
that
is
what
i
want
to
do
well

im
not
particulary
fond
of
that
plan

earl
remember
if
you
die

i
go
with
you
and
i
like
being
alive

i
like
eating

i
like
fucking

i
like
killing
i
have
to
end
it

marshall

one
way
or
another
and
i
think
this
is
the
best
way
fuck
you
then
you
worked
all
night
yes

i
had
to
sort
out
packets
for

women

packet
of
money

same
way

about

down
to
the
hatchet
being
left
at
the
scene
they
think
they

night

the
courage

hes
going
to
kill
you
after
you
killed
somebody
else
youre
getting
your
rocks
on

big
time

what

like
camera
flashes
coming
from
behind
the
curtains

like

through
with
it
unfortunately
for
you

the
end
of
that
story

do
this
to
me
if
you
touch
even
a
hair
on
my
head

hangman
killer
case

in
murdersuicide
it
says
there
that

an
answer
i
would
like
to
have
why
you
are
a
cop
you
are
rich

you
have
a
good
education
you
could
have
gone
into
your
fathers
business
instead
you
went
outside
all
of
that
and
became
successful
on
your
own

why
if
you
want
something
from
me
then
you

to
tell
me
who
you
are
or
im

hang
up

that
your
husbands
killing
was
random

in
san
fancisco

the
reason
this

a


triad
boss
lnto
everything
bribery

extortion

murder

you
name
it
years
ago

shiro
butchered
changs
family
he
actually
had
the
balls
to
fly
out
to
hong
kong
and
wiped
out
the
whole
fucking
cian
to
collectors
and
museums
all
thats
left
now
are
a
couple
of
horses
statuetes

two
of
them

about
this
big
word
on
the
street
is
that
shiro
is
looking
for
a
buyer
as
we
speak
changs
lost
of
honor
means
more
than
his
financial
lost
i
dont
care
about
the
horses
i
dont
care
about
bloodlines
or
ancient
family
feuds
for
the
first
time
in

years

we
got
a
real
shot
at
getting
rogue
all

now
that
you

spilled
the
blood
of
my
enemies
lets
drink
to
our
new
partnership
i
have
to
admit
i
was
somewhat
skeptical
when
you
first
came
to
me
with
your
proposal
by
leaving
shiros
service

that
was
a
wise
move
on
your
part
but
it
makes
me
wonder
how
could
one
truly
trust
a
man
who
has
betrayed
his
master
i
have
no
master
so
i
have
betrayed
no
one
my
horses

they
arrive
tonight
its
been

years

family

lived
in
shame
and
dishonor
all
because
of
shiros
treachery
tonight

i
will
take
back
what
was
stolen
from
my
family
and
everything
will
change
from
here

shiros
men
will
protect
his
treasure
with
their
lives

you
certain
you
can
deliver
them

would
these

ti
brothers

you

fbi
in
the
first
place
it

you
miserable
prick

there
goi
i
got
your
surgeon
he
made
a
positive
id
not
even
sound
like
him
look
in
my
eyes

john
the
one
thing
the
surgeons
could
never
change
jesus

tom

is
it
really
you
yeah
it
was
the
only
way
i
could
get
the
men
responsible
i
didnt
know
theyd
send
rogue
for
christs
sake

i
thought
he
was
dead
they
said
they
wanted
to
teach
you
a
lesson
for
shooting
rogue

just
rough
you
up
to
bit

thats
all
is
that
what
they
told
you
to
get
out
so
many
times
i
thought
if
i
could
make
that
son
of
a
bitch
pay
for
what
he
did
to
you

somehow
itd
make
things
right
again
stow
it
the
both
of
you
thats
an
order
understand
the
dutchman
is
under
my
command
do
not
forget
it
was
by
my
power
you
return
from
the
dead
not
yours
there
is
an
issue
far
more
troublesome
i
believe
youre
familiar
with
a
person
called
calypso
a
heathen
god
the
world
is
well
rid
of
her

not
quite
so
well

actually
that
was
our
agreement

your
agreement
and
then
you
betrayed
her
i
hadnt
finished
that
and
you
will
guarantee
elizabeths
safety
there
is
only
one
price
i
will
accept
calypso
murdered
calypsos
aboard
the
black
pearl
and
with
you
no
longer
aboard
her

how
do
you
propose
to
lead
us
there
theres
not
been
a
gathering
like
this
in
our
lifetime
i
convene
this

the
fourth
brethren
court
present
now
your
pieces
of
eight

my
fellow
capns
those
arent
pieces
of
eight

theyre
just
pieces
of
junk
aye

the
original
plan
was
to
use
nine
pieces
of
eight
to
bind
calypso
to
nine
pieces
of
whatever
we
happened
to
have
in
our
pockets
at
the
time
wheres
will
not
among
us
it
matters
not
how
they
found
us

the
question
is
better
were
the
days
when
mastery
of
seas
but
from
the
sweat
of
a
mans
brow
and
the
strength
of
his
back
alone
we
must
free
calypso
calypso
was
our
enemy
then

she
will
be
our
enemy
now
i
would
still
agree
with
sao
feng

we
release
calypso
you
threaten
me
i
silence
you
this
is
madness

this
is
politics
trapped
in
this
single
form
ten
years
i
looked
after
those
who
died
at
sea
and

finally

when
we
could
be
together
again
you
werent
there
it
was
the
first
court

but
i
love
his
pies
and
all

fact

item

about
if
we
could
see
that
item
you
told
us
about
with
our
own
eyes
to
help
put
an
ease
to
our
burden
of
guilt

so
to
speak
gents

i
give
you
the
fountain
of
youth
a
year
ago
my
life
had
collapsed
around
me
id
worked
myself
into
exhaustion
little
did
i
know
at
the
time

out
of
my
greatest
despair
was
to
come
the
greatest
gift
id
been
given
a
glimpse
of
a
great
secret
i
began
tracing
the
secret
back
through
history
i
couldnt
believe
all
the
people
who
knew
this
they
were
the
greatest
people
in
history
whispers
why
doesnt
any
one
know
this
all
i
wanted
to
do
was
share
the
secret
with
the
world
i
began
searching
for
people
alive
today
who
know
the
secret
one
by
one
they
began
to
emerge
you
know
this
secret
gives
you
everything
you
want
happiness

health
and
wealth
you
can
have

do

be
anything
you
want
we
can
have
whatever
it
is
that
we
choose
what
kind
of
a
house
do
you
want
to
live
in
what
kind
of
a
business
do
you
want
to
have
do
you
want
more
success
ive
seen
many
miracles
take
place
in
people
s
lives
financial
miracles

miracles
of
physical
healing
mental
healing

healing
in
relationships
all
of
this
happened
because
of
this
is
the
great
secret
of
life
ill
tell
you
how
ive
come
to
understand
it
we
all
work
with
one
infinite
power
we
all
guide
ourselves
by
exactly
the
same
laws
the
natural
laws
of
the
universe
are
so
precise
that
we
dont
even
have
any
difficulty
building
space
ships
we
can
send
people
to
the
moon
we
can
send
people
to
the
moon
i
dont
care
if
youre
in
india
if
youre
in
australia

new
zealand
stockholm
or
london
or
toronto
or
montreal
or
new
york
were
all
working
with
one
power
one
law
its
attraction
everything
that
s
coming
into
your
life
and
its
attracted
to
you
by
virtue
of
the
images
youre
holding
in
your
mind
you
see
whatever
is
going
on
in
your
mind
you
are
attracting
to
you
now
wise
people
have
always
known
that
now
wise
people
have
always
known
that
theyve
always
known
this
its
a
small
select
group
of
people
why
do
you
think
that
one
percent
of
the
population
earns
around

of
all
the
money
that
s
being
earned
do
you
think
that
s
an
accident
its
no
accident
its
designed
that
way
they
understand
something
they
understand
something
they
understand
the
secret
the
simplest
way
for
me
to
look
at
the
law
of
attraction
is
if
i
think
of
myself
as
a
magnet
and
i
know
that
a
magnet
will
attract
to
it
very
basically
put

the
law
of
attraction
says
but
were
really
talking
at
a
level
of
thought
make
it
absolute
clear
in
our
minds
what
we
want
from
that
we
start
to
invoke
one
of
the
greatest
laws
in
the
universe
you
become
what
you
think
about
most
but
you
also
attract
what
you
think
about
most
if
you
see
it
in
here
youre
going
to
hold
it
in
here
and
that
principle
can
be
summed
up
thoughts
things
what
most
people
dont
understand
is
every
thought
has
a
frequency
we
can
measure
a
thought
and
so
if
youre
thinking
that
thought
over
and
over
and
over
again
having
that
brand
new
car

having
the
money
that
you
need
having
that
brand
new
car

having
the
money
that
you
need
building
that
company

finding
your
soul
mate
if
youre
imagining
what
that
looks
like
youre
emitting
that
frequency
on
a
consistent
basis
thoughts
are
sending
out
that
magnetic
signal
that
is
drawing
the
parallel
back
to
you
see
yourself
living
in
abundance
it
always
works

it
works
every
time
heres
the
problem
heres
the
problem
and
theyre
wondering
why
it
shows
up
or
whether
you
dont
want
it

or
whether
you
do
want
it
its
responding
to
your
thoughts
its
responding
to
your
thoughts
feeling
terrible
about
it
thats
the
signal
youre
putting
out
into
the
universe
wow

i
feel
really
bad
because
of
all
this
debt
ive
got
youre
just
affirming
it
to
yourself
youre
just
affirming
it
to
yourself
thats
what
youre
going
to
get
more
of
so
when
youre
looking
at
that
thing
you
want
and
youre
saying
yes
to
it

youre
activating
a
thought
and
youre
saying
yes
to
it

youre
activating
a
thought
and
law
of
attraction
is
responding
to
that
thought
but
when
you
are
looking
at
something
that
you
do
not
want
and
you
shoutno
at
it
and
you
shoutno
at
it
instead
you
are
activating
the
very
thought
of
what
you
do
not
want
and
now
law
of
attraction
this
is
a
universe
that
is
based
upon
attraction
everything
is
about
attraction
the
law
of
attraction
is
always
working
whether
you
believe
it
or
understand
it
or
not
its
always
working
you
might
be
thinking
about
the
past
or
the
present
or
the
future
but
whether
youre
remembering
or
observing
or
imagining
still
in
that
process
you
are
activating
thought
and
law
of
attraction

which
is
the
most
powerful
law
of
the
universe
is
responding
to
your
thought
creation
is
always
happening
every
time
an
individual
has
a
thought
or
a
prolonged
chronic
way
of
thinking
theyre
in
the
creation
process
something
is
going
to
manifest
out
of
those
thoughts
law
of
attraction
says
well
give
you
whatever
it
is
you
say
and
focus
on
and
so
if
youre
complaining
about
how
bad
it
is
what
youre
creating
is
more
of
how
bad
it
is
i
had
a
student
named
robert
part
of
which
entails
email
access
to
me
and
he
outlined
all
of
the
grim
realities
of
his
life
in
his
job

all
the
people
ganged
up
on
him
and
it
was
constantly
stressful
because
of
how
nasty
they
were
with
him
when
he
walked
down
the
street

he
said
every
block
he
was
accosted
by
when
he
walked
down
the
street

he
said
every
block
he
was
accosted
by
homophobic
people

who
wanted
to
abuse
him
in
some
way
he
was
wanting
to
become
a
standup
comedian
and
when
he
went
out
and
did
a
standup
comedy
job
everybody
heckled
him
about
being
gay
and
his
whole
life
and
it
all
focused
around
this
idea
of
being
attacked
because
he
was
gay
i
directed
him
back
to
his
email
that
he
sent
me
and
said
read
it
again

look
at
all
the
things
you
do
not
want
read
it
again

look
at
all
the
things
you
do
not
want
and
i
can
tell
youre
very
passionate
about
this
when
you
focus
on
something
with
a
lot
of
passion
it
makes
it
happen
even
faster
and
then
he
really
started
taking
this
thing
about
focusing
on
what
you
want
to
heart
and
he
began
really
trying
it
what
happened
within
the
next


weeks
was
absolutely
a
miracle
he
said
that
all
the
people
in
his
office
that
had
been
harassing
him
or
started
totally
leaving
him
alone
and
he
began
to
love
his
job
he
noticed
that
when
he
was
walking
down
the
street
that
nobody
came
up
to
him
and
harassed
him
anymore
they
just
werent
there
when
he
went
and
did
his
standup
comedy
routines
he
started
getting
standing
ovations
and
no
body
was
heckling
him
his
whole
life
changed
because
he
changed
from
focusing
on
what
he
did
not
want
what
he
was
afraid
of

what
he
wanted
to
avoid
to
focusing
on
what
he
did
want
so
we
may
be
very
positive
in
our
outlook
and
orientation
and
we
tend
to
attract
positive
people
and
positive
events
and
circumstances
when
were
very
negative
in
our
orientation

or
very
angry
in
which
case
we
tend
to
attract
negative
angry
people
and
negative
angry
circumstances
and
so
you
end
up
attracting
to
you
the
predominant
thoughts
that
youre
holding
in
your
awareness
whether
those
thoughts
are
conscious
or
whether
theyre
unconscious
thats
the
rub
if
you
look
very
carefully
when
it
comes
to
the
secret
and
the
power
of
our
mind
and
the
power
of
our
intention
in
our
daily
lives
its
all
around
us
all
we
gotta
do
is
open
our
eyes
and
look
you
see
law
of
attraction
evidenced
in
your
society
when
you
see
that
the
one
who
speaks
most
of
illness
has
it
when
you
see
that
the
one
who
speaks
most
of
prosperity
has
it
law
of
attraction
is
evident
everywhere
around
you
if
you
are
understanding
what
it
is
it
has
to
do
with
you
being
a
magnet
indeed
everything
that
you
bring
into
your
experience
you
bring
because
of
this
powerful
law
of
attraction
i
mean

im
not
talking
to
you
from
the
point
of
view
of
just
wishful
thinking
or
imaginary
craziness
im
talking
to
you
from
a
deeper

basic
understanding
quantum
physics
really
begins
to
point
to
this
discovery
it
says
that
you
cant
have
a
universe
without
mind
entering
into
it
now
if
you
dont
understand
it
doesnt
mean
that
you
should
reject
it
you
dont
understand
electricity
properly
first
of
all
no
one
even
knows
what
electricity
is
and
yet
you
enjoy
the
benefits
of
it
but
i
do
know
this
that
you
can
cook
a
man
s
dinner
with
electricity
and
you
can
also
cook
the
man
become
frightened
of
all
these
negative
thoughts
that
they
have
two
things

they
need
to
be
aware
of
one
it
has
been
proven
now
scientifically
that
an
affirmative
thought
so
that
eliminates
a
degree
of
worry
right
there
you
live
in
a
reality
where
there
is
this
buffer
of
time
and
truly
that
serves
you
youre
really
not
wanting
to
be
in
an
environment
where
your
thoughts
manifest
immediately
the
evidence
is
long
in
coming
and
that
is
really
a
good
thing
so
you
want
to
become
aware
of
your
thoughts
you
want
to
choose
your
thoughts
carefully
and
you
want
to
have
fun
with
this
because
you
are
the
masterpiece
of
your
own
life
you
are
the
michaelangelo
of
your
own
life
the
david
that
you
are
sculpting
is
you
and
you
do
it
with
your
thoughts
the
leaders
in
the
past
who
had
the
secret
wanted
to
keep
the
power
and
not
share
the
power
so
they
kept
people
ignorant
of
the
secret
people
went
to
work

they
did
their
job
they
came
home
we
live
in
a
universe
in
which
there
are
laws
just
as
there
is
a
law
of
gravity

if
you
fall
off
a
building
it
doesnt
matter
if
you
are
a
good
person
or
a
bad
person
youre
gonna
hit
the
ground
everything
that
surrounds
you
right
now
in
your
life
including
the
things
youre
complaining
about

youve
attracted
now

i
know
at
first
blush
that
s
gonna
be
something
that
you
hate
to
hear
youre
gonna
immediately
say

i
didnt
attract
the
car
accident
i
didnt
attract
this
particular
client
i
didnt
particularly
attract
the
debt
i
didnt
attract
whatever
it
happens
to
be
that
youre
complaining
about
and
im
here
to
be
a
little
bit
in
your
face
and
to
say
and
this
is
one
of
the
hardest
concepts
to
get
but
once
youve
accepted
it
its
life
transforming
this
is
part
of
the
overall
giant
secret

here
and
most
of
us
attract
by
default
we
just
think
that
we
dont
have
any
control
over
it
our
thoughts
are
on
autopilot

our
feelings
are
on
autopilot
and
so

everything
is
just
brought
to
us
by
default
now
this
is
your
first
time
to
hear
this

it
may
feel
like
oh
i
have
to
now
monitor
my
thoughts
this
is
going
to
be
a
lot
of
work
it
will
seem
like
that
at
first
but
thats
where
the
fun
begins
we
do
not
encourage
that
you
try
to
monitor
your
thoughts
that
will
sort
of
make
you
crazy
there
are
so
many
thoughts
coming
to
you
there
are
so
many
thoughts
coming
to
you
thats
where
your
emotional
guidance
system
comes
in
your
emotions
your
emotional
guidance
system
your
emotions
your
emotional
guidance
system
is
what
helps
you
to
understand
what
youre
thinking
so
your
thoughts
cause
your
feelings
the
emotions
are
this
incredible
gift
that
we
have
to
let
us
know
what
were
attracting
there
are
only
two
emotions
from
our
perspective
one
feels
good
and
one
feels
bad
you
call
them
all
sorts
of
different
things
but
essentially
all
of
those
negative
emotions
whether
you
call
it
guilt

or
anger
or
frustration
all
feel
much
the
same
and
all
of
them
are
guidance
saying
that
which
you
are
thinking
about
right
now
is
not
in
line
with
what
you
are
really
wanting
on
another
level
it
s
called
bad
frequency
or
bad
vibes
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
that
good
feeling

that
positive
emotion

is
guidance
saying
so
its
really
so
simple
its
right
there

the
answer

what
am
i
attracting
right
now
well

how
do
you
feel
i
feel
good
our
feelings
are
a
feedback
mechanism
to
us
about
whether
were
on
track
or
not
about
whether
were
on
track
or
not
the
better
you
feel

the
more
in
alignment
you
are
the
worse
you
feel

the
more
out
of
alignment
you
are
what
you
are
doing
as
you
are
moving
through
the
variety
of
your
day
to
day
experience
is
you
are
offering
thoughts
and
you
can
tell
by
the
way
you
feel
if
the
things
that
you
are
moving
toward
will
please
you
when
you
get
there
and
youre
getting
exactly
what
youre
feeling
about
not
so
much
what
it
is
youre
thinking
about
thats
why
people
if
they
stub
their
toe
out
of
bed
they
tend
to
spiral
they
have
no
clue
that
a
simple
shifting
of
their
emotions
can
change
their
entire
day
and
life
if
you
start
out
having
a
good
day
and
youre
in
that
particular
happy
feeling
more
situations

people
that
sustain
that
happy
feeling
good
days
bad
days

rich
get
richer

poor
get
poorer
its
all
about
what
these
people
are
predominantly
you
can
begin
right
now
to
feel
healthy
you
can
begin
to
feel
prosperous
you
can
begin
to
feel
the
love
thats
surrounding
you
even
if
its
not
there
and
what
will
happen
is
the
universe
will
correspond
to
the
nature
of
that
inner
feeling
and
manifest

because
thats
the
way
you
feel
so
basically
what
you
focus
on
with
thought
and
feeling
is
what
you
attract
into
your
experience
whether
or
not
it
s
something
you
want
every
single
time

no
exception
its
hard
to
swallow
but
when
we
can
begin
to
open
ourselves
up
to
that
the
ramifications
are
awesome
it
means
that
whatever
thought
has
done
in
your
life
it
can
be
undone
through
a
shift
in
your
awareness
its
really
important
that
you
feel
good
because
this
feeling
good
is
what
goes
out
as
a
signal
into
the
universe
and
starts
to
attract
more
of
itself
to
you
so
the
more
you
can
feel
good
the
more
you
will
attract
the
things
that
help
you
feel
good
and
are
able
to
keep
bringing
you
up
higher
and
higher
when
youre
feeling
down
did
you
know
that
you
can
change
it
like
that
put
on
a
beautiful
piece
of
music
start
singing

thatll
change
your
emotion
or
think
of
something
beautiful
think
of
a
baby
maybe
one
you
love
and
dwell
on
it

really
keep
that
thought
in
your
mind
and
dwell
on
it

really
keep
that
thought
in
your
mind
block
everything
out
but
that
thought
this
principle
applies
to
your
family
pet
for
instance
which
i
believe
are
wonderful
because
they
put
you
in
a
great
emotional
state
when
you
feel
love
for
your
pet
thats
a
great
state
of
love
thats
going
to
bring
goodness
into
your
life
and
what
a
gift
that
is
and
when
you
begin
to
get
the
hang
of
this
when
you
begin
to
guide
your
thoughts
based
upon
the
way
they
feel
and
you
begin
to
notice
the
correlation
between
and
you
begin
to
notice
the
correlation
between
what
youre
feeling
and
thinking
and
what
s
coming
back
to
you
before
you
know
it
you
will
know
that
you
are
the
creator
of
your
own
reality
and
those
who
are
watching
from
a
distance
will
stand
in
amazement
at
the
perfect
life
you
live
since
i
learned
the
secret
and
started
applying
it
to
my
life
my
life
has
truly
become
magical
i
think
the
kind
of
life
that
everybody
dreams
of
and
i
live
on
a
daytoday
basis
i
live
in
a
four
and
a
half
million
dollar
mansion
i
have
a
wife
to
die
for
i
get
to
vacation
in
all
the
fabulous
spots
of
the
world
ive
climbed
mountains

ive
explored

ive
been
on
safaris
and
all
of
this
happened
and
continues
to
happen
because
of
knowing
how
to
apply
the
secret
life
can
be
absolutely
phenomenal
and
it
should
be
and
it
will
be
when
you
start
using
the
secret
well
a
lot
of
people
ask
me
what
their
job
is
in
the
creative
process
and
what
the
job
of
the
universe
is
so
lets
look
at
that
for
a
moment
lets
use
this
metaphor
if
you
think
about
aladdin
and
his
lamp
youve
probably
heard
of
that
one
i
mean

aladdin
picks
up
the
lamp
and
he
dusts
it
off
and
out
pops
the
genie
the
genie
always
says
one
thing
your
wish
is
my
command
if
you
trace
the
story
back
to
its
origins

you
know
but
if
you
trace
the
story
back
to
its
origins
theres
absolutely
no
limit
whatsoever
to
the
wishes
think
about
that
one
now

lets
take
this
metaphor
and
blow
it
out
remember
aladdin
is
the
one
who
always
asks
for
what
he
wants
then
youve
got
the
universe
at
large
which
is
this
grand
genie
your
holy
guardian
angel

your
higher
self
and
you
chose
the
one
that
works
best
for
you
but
every
tradition
has
told
us
theres
something
bigger
than
us
and
the
genie
always
says
one
thing
step
one
is
you
must
ask
for
what
you
want
you
do
not
need
to
use
words
to
ask

in
fact
the
universe
is
responding
completely
to
your
thought
what
do
you
really
want
sit
down
and
write
it
out
on
a
piece
of
paper
you
might
begin
by
writing

i
am
so
happy
and
grateful
now
that
and
then
explain
how
you
want
your
life
to
be
in
every
area
and
this
is
really
fun
this
is
like
having
the
universe
as
your
catalogue
and
you
flip
through
it
and
you
go
well

id
like
to
have
this
experience
and
id
like
to
have
that
product
and
id
like
to
have
a
person
like
that
it
is
you
just
placing
your
order
with
the
universe
its
really
that
easy
the
second
step
is
answer
and
that
is
not
your
work
in
your
physical
form
the
universe
will
do
that
step
for
you
all
of
the
universal
forces
and
the
universe
will
start
to
rearrange
itself
because
we
cant
see
how
its
going
to
manifest
if
you
do
just
a
little
research
that
anyone
that
ever
accomplished
anything
did
not
know
how
they
were
going
to
do
it
you
dont
need
to
know
how
its
going
to
come
about
you
dont
need
to
know
how
the
universe
will
rearrange
itself
you
dont
know
how

itll
be
shown
to
you
so
then
our
friends
say
because
i
know
i
am
asking
so
where
s
my
stuff
and
we
say

you
are
asking
you
are
completing
step
one

you
cant
help
but
do
that
and
the
universe
is
answering
every
time

no
exception
but
there
is
another
step
that
you
must
understand
and
it
is
called
step
three

which
is
the
receiving
step
which
means
you
must
bring
yourself
into
alignment
when
you
are
in
alignment
with
what
you
want

you
feel
wonderful
thats
what
enthusiasm
is
thats
what
joy
is

thats
what
appreciation
is
but
when
you
are
feeling
despair
those
are
strong
indicators
that
you
are
not
right
now
in
alignment
with
what
youre
asking
for
and
so

when
you
begin
to
realise
that
the
way
you
feel
is
everything
and
you
begin
to
direct
your
thoughts
based
upon
how
they
feel
little
by
little
you
can
find
the
feeling
place
of
it
and
now
you
are
one
with
it
and
now
it
must
manifest
into
your
experience
and
when
you
turn
that
fantasy
into
a
fact
youre
in
the
position
to
build
bigger
and
better
fantasies
and
that
my
friend

is
the
creative
process
so

the
law
of
attraction
is
just
figuring
out
what
will
help
you
and
remember
them
it
could
be
you
wake
up
and
its
just
there

it
s
manifest
or

you
might
get
some
inspired
idea
of
some
action
to
take
because
youre
not
on
the
right
track
if
that
s
the
case
action
will
sometimes
be
required
but
if
youre
really
doing
it
in
line
with
what
the
universe
is
trying
to
deliver
its
going
to
feel
joyous
time
will
just
stop

you
could
do
it
all
day
the
universe
likes
speed
dont
delay
dont
second
guess

dont
doubt
when
the
opportunity
s
there

when
the
impulse
is
there
when
the
intuitive
nudge
from
within
is
there
thats
your
job
and
thats
all
you
have
to
do
you
will
attract
everything
that
you
require
if
its
money
you
need
you
will
attract
it
if
its
a
certain
book
you
need
youll
attract
it
youve
gotta
pay
attention
to
what
youre
attracted
to
because
as
you
hold
images
of
what
you
want
youre
gonna
be
attracted
to
things
and
theyre
gonna
be
attracted
to
you
but
it
literally
moves
into
physical
reality
and
it
does
that
by
law
you
can
start
with
nothing
and
out
of
nothing
and
out
of
no
way
a
way
will
be
made
the
headlights
only
go
a
hundred
to
two
hundred
feet
forward
and
you
can
make
it
all
the
way
from
california
to
new
york
driving

through
the
dark
and
thats
how
life
tends
to
unfold
before
us
and
if
we
just
trust
that
the
next
two
hundred
feet
will
unfold
after
that
that
and
the
next
two
hundred
feet
will
unfold
after
that
of
whatever
it
is
you
truly
want

because
you
want
it
well
another
thing
people
wonder
about
is
how
long
will
it
take
to
manifest
the
car

the
relationship
the
money

or
whatever
it
happens
to
be
well

i
dont
have
any
rule
book
that
says
i
think
its
more
a
matter
of
you
size
is
nothing
to
the
universe
it
is
no
more
difficult
to
attract
on
a
scientific
level
to
something
that
we
consider
infinitesimally
small
the
universe
does
everything
it
does
with
zero
effort
its
about
what
we
put
in
place
saying
this
is
small

oh
ill
give
it
an
hour
you
know

those
are
our
rules
that
we
define
there
are
no
rules
according
to
the
universe
you
provide
the
feelings
of
having
it
now
it
will
respond
and
so
we
sometimes
say

well

start
with
something
small
like
a
cup
of
coffee
somehow
or
another
somebodys
going
to
start
talking
to
you
about
that
person
that
persons
going
to
phone
you
or
youll
get
a
letter
from
them
people
are
amazed
at
how
i
line
up
car
parks
and
ive
done
this
right
from
when
i
first
understood
the
secret
i
would
visualise
a
car
space
exactly
where
i
wanted
it
and

of
the
time
it
would
be
there
for
me
and
i
would
just
pull
straight
in
of
the
time
id
have
to
wait
just
a
minute
or
two
and
the
person
would
pull
out
and
id
pull
in
so
i
do
that
all
that
time
and
im
trying
to
point
out
that
whatever
your
circumstances
right
now
that
is
only
your
current
reality
and
current
reality
will
begin
to
change
as
a
result
of
watching
this
and
beginning
to
use
the
secret
and
sometimes
it
feels
like
youre
stuck

because
you
continue
and
so
you
tend
to
get
the
same
results
and
the
reason
is
because
and
when
you
think
about
what
is
law
of
attraction
gives
you
more
of
it
and
law
of
attraction
gives
you
more
of
what
is
you
have
to
find
a
way
that
you
are
approaching
what
is
most
people
look
at
their
current
state
of
affairs
and
they
say
this
is
who
i
am
thats
not
who
you
are
thats
who
you
were
you
see
if
you
look
at
your
current
state
of
affairs
right
now
lets
say
for
instance
that
you
dont
have
a
lot
of
money
in
your
bank
account
or
you
dont
have
the
relationship
that
you
want
or
your
health
and
fitness
isnt
up
to
par
thats
not
who
you
are
thats
not
who
you
are
so
were
constantly
living
in
this
residual
if
you
will
of
the
thoughts
and
actions
weve
taken
in
the
past
then
you
doom
yourself
to
have
nothing
more
than
the
same
in
future
okay

what
you
can
you
do
right
now
to
begin
to
turn
your
life
around
ill
tell
you
two
or
three
things
start
making
a
list
of
things
to
be
grateful
for
start
with
that

because
this
shifts
your
energy
it
starts
to
shift
your
thinking
where
before
this
exercise
you
might
be
focusing
on
what
you
dont
have
and
you
might
be
focusing
on
your
complaint
and
you
might
be
focusing
on
whatever
the
problems
are
when
you
do
this
exercise
you
start
to
go
on
a
different
direction
you
start
to
be
grateful
for
all
the
things
that
you
feel
good
about
gratitude
is
absolutely
the
way
to
bring
more
into
your
life
every
man
knows
that
when
his
wifes
appreciating
him
for
the
little
things
he
does

what
does
he
want
to
do
its
always
about
appreciation
thats
that
feeling
that
you
have
to
have
and
so
for
me
it
s
been
such
a
powerful
exercise
every
morning
to
get
up
and
say
thank
you
and
then
i
start
running
through
what
im
grateful
for
as
im
going
to
brush
my
teeth
and
do
the
things
i
do
in
the
morning
and
im
not
just
thinking
about
them
and
doing
some
rote
routine
but
im
putting
it
out
there
you
will
start
to
attract
more
of
the
good
things
more
of
the
things
you
can
be
grateful
for
because
you
could
look
around
and
say
i
dont
have
the
health
i
want

i
dont
have
the
spouse
i
want
whoah

back
up

back
up
those
are
all
the
things
you
dont
want
focus
on
what
you
already
have
that
youre
grateful
for
and
it
might
be

you
have
the
eyes
to
watch
this
it
might
be
the
clothes
that
you
have
yes

you
might
prefer
something
else
and
you
might
get
something
else
pretty
soon
if
you
start
feeling
grateful
for
what
you
have
i
think
everybody
goes
through
times
when
they
say
oh
man

things
arent
working
right
or
things
are
going
bad
and
i
found
a
rock
i
found
a
rock

i
stuck
it
in
my
pocket

and
i
said
im
going
to
think
of
something
that
im
grateful
for
so
every
morning
when
i
get
up
in
the
morning
i
pick
it
up
of
f
the
dresser

i
put
it
in
my
pocket
and
i
go
through
the
things
that
im
grateful
for
at
night

what
do
you
do
you
empty
your
pocket
and
there
it
is
again
and
ive
had
some
different
experiences
with
that
ive
had
some
amazing
experiences
i
had
a
guy
from
south
africa

he
saw
me
drop
it
and
he
said
what
is
that
what
is
that
i
explained
it
to
him

so
he
started
calling
it
a
gratitude
rock
two
weeks
later
i
got
an
email
from
him

from
south
africa
and
he
said

my
son
is
dying
from
a
rare
disease

it
s
a
type
of
hepatitis
would
you
send
me
three
gratitude
rocks
they
were
just
rocks
i
found
off
the
street

you
know

so
i
said

sure
i
had
to
make
sure
that
the
rocks
were
very
special
and
so
i
went
out
to
the
stream
and
sent
them
off
to
him
he
said

my
son
s
better

hes
doing
terrific
and
he
said

but
you
need
to
know
something
and
he
said

but
you
need
to
know
something
as
gratitude
rocks
and
so
its
very
important
to
be
in
an
another
thing
that
i
would
suggest
and
this
is
so
huge
that
i
cant
find
the
words
to
describe
just
how
powerful
this
can
be
for
you
i
took
the
visualisation
process
from
the
apollo
program
and
instituted
it
during
the
s
and
s
into
the
olympic
program
and
it
was
called
visual
motor
rehearsal
and
the
interesting
thing
about
the
mind
is
we
took
olympic
athletes
and
then
hooked
them
up
to
sophisticated
biofeedback
equipment
and
had
them
run
their
event
only
in
their
mind
incredibly

the
same
muscles
fired
in
the
same
sequence
as
when
they
were
running
it
on
the
track
how
could
this
be
or
whether
it
s
just
a
practice
when
youre
visualizing
when
youre
visualizing
always
and
only
dwell
upon
the
end
result
heres
an
example
the
colour
of
your
skin

the
freckles

the
blood
vessels
take
in
all
those
details
of
your
brand
new
car
this
is
such
a
holographic
experience

so
real
that
you
dont
even
feel
like
you
need
the
car
because
it
feels
like
you
already
have
it
see
its
the
feeling
not
just
the
picture
or
the
thought
not
just
the
picture
or
the
thought
well
if
i
think
positive
thoughts
but
if
youre
doing
that
and
still
not
feeling
abundant
this
is
where
the
secret
actually
moves
into
action
you
put
yourself
in
the
feeling
place
of
really
being
in
that
car
not

oh
i
wish
i
could
get
that
car
or
because
that
s
a
very
definite
feeling
associated
with
that
its
not
in
the
now

its
not

you
know

its
in
the
future
if
you
stay
in
that
feeling
feel
the
joy

feel
the
happiness
no
matter
how
silly
it
seems
in
that
dark
and
quiet
room
and
youre
going

woo
hoo
do
it
how
bad
do
you
want
change
our
job
is
not
to
figure
out
the
how
the
hows
are
the
domain
of
the
universe
it
always
knows
the
shortest

quickest

fastest
most
harmonious
way
between
you
and
your
dream
if
you
turn
it
over
to
the
universe
you
will
be
surprised
and
dazzled
by
what
is
delivered
to
you
this
is
where
magic
and
miracles
happen
well
i
would
say
you
want
to
do
this
virtually
daily
but
my
disclaimer
is

this
should
never
be
a
chore
whats
really
bottom
line
important
here
you
want
to
feel
exhilarated
by
this
whole
process
the
only
difference
between
people
who
really
are
living
this
way
and
people
who
arent
living
in
the
magic
of
life
is
that
the
people
who
are
living
in
the
magic
of
life
have
habituated
ways
of
being
they
have
habituated
this
process
and
magic
happens
with
them
wherever
they
go
because
they
remember
it
and
they
do
it
all
the
time
not
as
a
one
time
event
people
hold
that
for
a
while
and
theyre
really
a
champion
at
it
and
they
say
and
im
gonna
change
my
life
and
yet
you
know
results
arent
showing
results
arent
showing
and
beneath
the
surface
its
just
about
ready
to
break
through
and
someone
will
look
at
the
surface
results
and
go
you
know
what
the
universe
says
and
it
goes
down
knowing
the
law
of
attraction
and
in

i
started
to
create
something
called
a
vision
board
where
i
take
something
that
i
want
to
achieve
or
something
that
i
want
to
attract
like
a
car
or
a
watch
or
and
i
put
a
picture
of
what
i
want
and
i
would
look
up
at
this
board
and
i
would
start
to
visualise
and
i
would
look
up
at
this
board
and
i
would
start
to
visualise
i
would
really
get
into
the
state
of
having
already
acquired
it
i
was
getting
ready
to
move

we
put
all
i
was
getting
ready
to
move

we
put
all
and
i
made
three
different
moves
over
a
period
of
five
years
and
then
i
ended
up
in
california
and
bought
this
house
and
then
had
all
the
stuff
brought
from
my
former
home
five
years
earlier
one
morning

about
seven
thirty
in
the
morning
and
one
of
the
boxes
that
was
sealed
for
five
years
was
right
at
the
door
step
and
my
son
came
in
and
he
was
sitting
on
the
box
banging
away
at
the
box
and
i
said

sweetheart
will
you
please
stop

im
doing
some
work
here
whats
in
the
boxes
daddy
and
i
said

well
honey

those
are
my
vision
boards
whats
a
vision
board
i
said

well
its
where
i
put
all
my
goals
up
i
cut
them
out
and
i
put
all
my
goals
up
and
of
course
at
five
and
a
half
years
old
he
didnt
understand
and
so
i
said

sweet
let
me
just
show
you
and
so
i
cut
the
box
open
and
when
i
pulled
up
the
vision
boards
that
i
was
visualising
five
years
earlier
not
a
house
like
it
i
bought
my
dream
home

renovated
it
and
didnt
even
know
it
honey

i
finally
understand
how
the
law
of
attraction
works
i
finally
understand
the
power
of
visualisation
my
whole
life
decide
what
you
want
believe
you
can
have
it
believe
you
deserve
it
and
believe
it
s
possible
for
you
and
then
close
your
eyes
every
day
for
several
minutes
and
visualize
and
feeling
the
feelings
of
already
having
it
and
really
be

enjoy
it

okay
and
then
go
into
your
day
and
release
it
you
know

the
secret
was
definitely
a
real
transformation
for
me
because
i
grew
up
in
a
family
where
my
dad
was
very
negative
thought
that
rich
people
were
people
that
had
ripped
everyone
off
thought
that
anyone
that
had
money
must
have
deceived
somebody
so
i
grew
up
with
a
lot
of
beliefs
about
money
you
know

only
evil
people
have
money
and
you
know

money
doesnt
grow
on
trees
that
was
one
of
his
favourite
phrases
that
it
was
hard
when
i
was
working
with
stone
he
said

i
want
you
to
set
a
goal
that
s
so
big
that
if
you
achieved
it

it
would
blow
your
mind
and
you
would
know
it
s
only
because
of
what
ive
taught
you
that
you
would
have
achieved
this
goal
well

at
the
time
and
for
some
reason
i
wanted
something
that
was
really
measurable
i
had
no
idea
how
i
could
do
that
i
saw
no
strategy

no
possibility
but
i
just
said

im
going
to
declare
that
im
going
to
believe
it
and
release
it
and
so
i
did
that
that
id
put
on
the
ceiling
and
then
i
would
close
my
eyes
and
visualize
a
year
lifestyle
and
interestingly
enough
you
know

i
didnt
have
any
great
breakthrough
ideas
and
all
of
a
sudden
i
was
in
the
shower
it
was
about
four
weeks
into
it
i
had
a
book
i
had
written
at
a
quarter
each
now

the
book
was
there
now
i
didnt
know
how
to
do
that
i
didnt
know
how
i
was
going
to
sell
four
hundred
thousand
copies
and
then
i
saw
the
national
enquirer
at
the
supermarket
i
had
seen
that
millions
of
times

and
it
was
just
background
and
all
of
a
sudden
it
jumped
out
at
me
as
foreground
and
i
thought

wow

if
readers
knew
about
my
book

certainly
and
about
six
weeks
later
i
gave
a
talk
at
hunter
college
in
new
york
to
six
hundred
teachers

and
this
lady
comes
up
at
the
end
and
she
says

that
was
a
great
talk

i
want
to
interview
you
let
me
give
you
my
card
let
me
give
you
my
card
and
i
said

who
do
you
write
for
you
know

and
i
had
this
little
theme
from
like

whoah

this
stuff�s
really
working
so
that
article
came
out
but
the
point
i
want
to
make
is
that
i
was
attracting
into
my
life
and
to
make
a
long
story
short
i
did
not
make
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
that
year
but
you
think
we
were
like
depressed
and
going
this
doesnt
work
and
so
my
wife
said
to
me
wow

if
it
works
for
a
hundred
thousand
do
you
think
itd
work
for
a
million
and
my
publisher
actually
wrote
me
a
check
it
was
a
royalty
check
he
actually
put
a
smiley
face
in
the
signature
cause
it
was
the
first
million
dollar
check
hed
ever
written
and
so
i
know
from
my
own
experience
because
i
wanted
to
test
it
does
this
secret
really
work
and
we
put
it
to
the
test
it
absolutely
worked
well

i
can
just
imagine
what
a
lot
of
people
that
are
watching
this
are
thinking
how
can
i
get
more
of
the
green
stuff
how
can
i
get
more
of
wealth
and
prosperity
how
can
i

when
i
love
my
job
and
the
realization
that
maybe
there�s
a
ceiling
on
the
money
that
can
come
in
cause
its
coming
to
me
through
my
job
how
can
i
bring
in
more
intend
it
this
goes
back
to
one
of
the
things
weve
been
talking
about
throughout
the
whole
secret
your
job
is
to
declare
well

if
cash
is
one
of
them
or
whatever
it
happens
to
be
most
people
have
a
goal
of
getting
out
of
debt
that�ll
keep
you
in
debt
forever
whatever
youre
thinking
about
you
will
attract
you
say

but
its
get
out
of
debt
i
dont
care
if
it
s
get
out
or
get
in
if
youre
thinking
debt
youre
attracting
debt
so
many
times
people
say
to
me
so
many
times
people
say
to
me
but
then
you
look
at
their
actions
and
theyre
not
doing
the
things
but
then
you
look
at
their
actions
and
theyre
not
doing
the
things
you
know

theyll
turn
right
around
and
theyll
go
ok

guess
what

your
wish
is
my
command
as
you
are
fussing
about
not
having
enough
money
as
you
are
talking
to
your
friend
about
not
having
enough
money
as
you
are
feeling
unhappy
about
not
having
enough
money
you
are
actually
activating
within
yourself
that
is
very
different
from
the
desire
that
you
have
launched
what
it
just
comes
down
to
is
you
just
cant
want
more
money
and
focus
upon
not
enough
when
i
first
understood
the
secret
every
day
i
would
get
a
bunch
of
bills
in
the
mail
and
i
thought
how
do
i
turn
this
around
that
what
you
focus
on
you
will
get
and
i
put
a
new
total
in
there
and
i
put
a
new
total
in
there
what
if
i
just
visualized
checks
coming
in
the
mail
so
i
just
visualized
a
bunch
of
checks
coming
in
the
mail
and
its
amazing
and
its
amazing
i
get
a
few
bills

but
i
get
more
checks
than
bills
i
grew
up
on
you
have
to
work
hard
for
money
you
have
to
work
hard
for
money
money
comes
easily
and
frequently
when
it
comes
to
creating
wealth

wealth
is
a
mindset
its
all
about
how
you
think
id
say

of
my
coaching
that
i
do
one
on
one
with
folks
is
about
their
psychology
and
the
way
they
think
i
know
when
people
are
listening
they
say
oh

well
you
can
do
it

i
cant
but
their
relationships
stink
thats
a
technical
term

by
the
way
and
thats
not
wealth

it
really
isnt
you
know

you
can
go
after
the
money
and
you
might
get
rich
but
it
doesnt
guarantee
youll
be
wealthy
im
not
suggesting
that
money
isnt
a
part
of
wealth
but
its
only
a
part
and
then
i
meet
a
lot
of
people
who
are
but
theyre
sick
and
broke
all
the
time
thats
not
wealth
either
life
is
meant
to
be
abundant

in
all
areas
many
people
in
western
culture
are
striving
for
success
they
want
to
have
the
home

they
want
their
business
to
work
they
want
all
of
these
things
but
what
i
found
in
my
research
is
that
having
those
things
certainly
doesnt
guarantee
what
we
really
want
and
thats
when
all
those
outer
things
come
they
dont
come
from
going
after
them
first
to
get
happiness
and
then
all
the
other
things
from
the
outside
appear
the
secret
means
for
me
actually
that
we
are
creators
of
our
universe
and
that
every
wish
of
what
we
want
to
create
therefore
its
very
important
what
you
wish
because
it
will
manifest
inside
relationships

it
s
important
and
i
dont
mean
about
your
partner
if
you
dont
enjoy
your
own
company
and
so

again
is
about
bringing
that
into
your
life
heres
the
question
i
would
to
ask
you
to
consider
you
become
the
solution
for
you
instead

give
more
to
yourself
in
a
sense
to
fill
yourself
up
to
fullness
to
where
now
you
can
overflow
in
giving
i
got
into
many
relationships
expecting
my
partner
i
needed
to
see
him
showing
me
my
beauty
because
i
didnt
feel
beautiful
because
when
i
was
growing
up
my
sheroes
were
charlie
s
angels
and
though
they
were
wonderful
women
it
wasnt
until
i
stopped
full
lips

round
hips

mocha
skin

afro
that
the
rest
of
the
world
began
to
fall
in
love
with
lisa
theres
something
so
magnificent
about
you
i
have
been
studying
me
for

years

mwa
because
youre
gonna
get
to
love
yourself
im
not
talking
about
conceit
and
as
you
love
yourself

youll
love
others
sometimes
people
will
say
or
my
children
are
so
worrisome
to
me
we
encourage
that
you
get
a
notebook
and
you
make
a
list
of
the
positive
aspects
there
could
be
someone
that
you
have
a
terrible
experience
with
a
terrible
relationship
with
and
in
the
privacy
of
your
own
mind
and
even
though
you
can
not
create
in
their
reality
if
they
are
in
a
mood
or
an
attitude
that
doesnt
match
law
of
attraction
will
not
put
you
in
the
same
space
together
your
frequencies
dont
match
up
you
would
free
yourself
of
needing
to
control
the
world
for
noone
else
can
think
for
you
no
one
else
can
do
it
it
is
only
you
every
bit
of
it
you
its
important
to
recognize
that
our
body
were
beginning
to
understand
in
medical
science
the
degree
to
which
the
nature
of
thoughts
and
emotions
actually
determines
the
physical
substance
and
structure
weve
known
in
the
healing
arts
like
a
sugar
pill
or
something
that
this
is
just
as
effective
so
they
found
out
that
the
human
mind
is
the
biggest
factor
more
so
than
sometimes
the
medication
if
somebody
is
in
a
situation
where
theyre
sick
and
they
have
an
alternative
to
try
to
explore
versus
using
medicine
versus
using
medicine
then
obviously
the
medicine
is
a
wise
thing
to
do
while
they
explore
what
the
mind
is
about
so
you
dont
want
to
negate
medicine
there
is
only
a
stream
of
well
being
that
flows

you
know
it
is
a
stream
of
pure
positive
energy
and
the
universe

all
that
we
know
this
is
a
world
that
is
based
upon
wellbeing
and
when
you
are
pinching
it
off
a
bit
there
is
only
a
stream
of
goodness
or
wellbeing
and
your
magnificent
emotions
how
youre
doing
in
your
allowing
you
know
people
who
have
had
terminal
disease
stop
and
think
of
the
word
disease
thats
a
body
that
s
not
at
ease
weve
got
a
thousand
different
diagnosis
and
disease
out
there
theyre
just
the
weak
link
stress
and
you
put
enough
stress
on
the
chain
and
you
put
enough
stress
on
the
system
our
physiology
creates
disease
to
give
us
feedback
to
let
us
know
so
the
body
signs
and
symptoms
the
question
is
frequently
asked
is
when
a
person
has
or
some
kind
of
discomfort
in
their
life
and
the
answer
is
absolutely
yes
on
november
rd
i
was
diagnosed
with
breast
cancer
i
truly
believed
in
my
heart

with
my
strong
faith
during
the
day

all
day
long
on
and
on
and
on
i
went
i
believed
in
my
heart
i
was
healed
i
saw
myself
as
if
cancer
was
never
in
my
body
one
of
the
things
i
did
to
heal
myself
was
to
watch
very
funny
movies
thats
all
we
would
do
is
just
laugh

laugh

laugh
we
couldnt
afford
to
put
any
stress
in
my
life
because
we
knew
stress
was
one
of
the
worst
things
you
can
do
while
youre
trying
to
heal
yourself
from
the
time
i
was
diagnosed

which
was
november
rd
to
the
time
i
was
healed

totally
and
thats
without
radiation
or
chemotherapy
we
come
with
a
basic
program
you
get
a
wound
you
get
a
bacterial
infection
the
immune
system
is
made
to
heal
itself
your
body
is
casting
off
millions
of
cells
every
second
and
its
creating
millions
of
new
cells
in
fact
literally

parts
of
our
body
are
replaced
every
day
other
parts
take
a
few
months

other
parts
a
couple
of
years
but
within
a
few
years
if
you
have
a
disease

and
youre
focusing
on
it
and
youre
talking
to
people
about
it
youre
going
to
create
more
diseased
cells
see
yourself
living
in
a
perfectly
healthy
body
let
the
doctor
look
after
the
disease
can
you
feel
the
difference
between
having
painful
arthritis
in
your
hips
can
you
feel
the
difference
between
having
painful
arthritis
in
your
hips
or
having
painful
arthritis
in
your
hips
the
difference
between
fearful
and
hopeful
happier
thoughts
lead
to
essentially
a
happier
biochemistry
a
happier

healthier
body
a
happier

healthier
body
because
it
s
our
thoughts
and
emotions
that
are
continuously
reassembling
reorganising

recreating

our
body
remove
physiological
stress
from
the
body
it
heals
itself
ive
seen
kidneys
regenerated
ive
seen
eyesight
improve
and
come
back
i
always
say
that
incurable
means
curable
from
within
you
can
change
your
life
and
you
can
heal
yourself
well

my
story
begins
on
march
the
th
it
really
changed
my
whole
life

it
was
a
day
ill
never
forget
i
crashed
an
airplane
i
ended
up
in
the
hospital
completely
paralysed
my
spinal
chord
was
crushed
i
broke
the
first
and
second
cervical
vertebrae
my
swallowing
reflex
was
destroyed

i
couldnt
eat
or
drink
my
diaphragm
was
destroyed

i
couldnt
breathe
all
i
could
do
was
blink
my
eyes
the
doctors

of
course

said
all
my
life
id
be
a
vegetable
all
id
do
is
blink
my
eyes
the
rest
of
my
life
thats
the
picture
they
saw
of
me

but
it
didnt
matter
what
they
thought
the
main
thing
was
what
i
thought
i
pictured
myself
being
a
normal
person
again

walking
out
of
that
hospital
the
only
thing
i
had
to
work
with
in
the
hospital
was
my
mind
i
was
hooked
to
a
respirator
and
they
said
id
never
breathe
on
my
own
again
because
my
diaphragm
was
destroyed
but
this
little
voice
kept
saying
to
me
and
finally
i
was
weaned
from
it
they
were
at
a
loss
for
an
explanation
see
i
could
not
afford
to
allow
anything
to
come
into
my
mind
that
would
distract
me
well
id
set
the
goal
to
walk
out
of
the
hospital
on
christmas
eight
months
later
i
walked
out
of
the
hospital
on
my
own
two
feet
they
said
it
couldnt
be
done
thats
a
day
i
will
never
forget
for
people
that
are
sitting
out
there
right
now
watching
this
program
i
would
sum
it
up
this
way
in
six
words
man
becomes
what
he
thinks
about
we
notice
there
are
so
many
people
who
are
they
look
out
and
they
see
things
that
are
wonderful
and
they
say

yes

we
want
more
of
those

we
would
vote
for
that
we
would
support
that
with
our
time
and
energy
and
money
but
then
they
look
out
and
they
see
things
that
they
do
not
want
terrible
things

that
they
do
not
want
to
live
and
that
they
do
not
want
to
see
others
live
and
they
say

weve
got
to
do
something
about
getting
rid
of
those
things
but
they
dont
realise
they
add
power
to
it
in
this
world
there
is
a
war
against
poverty
and
a
war
against
cancer
and
a
war
against
terrorism
and
a
war
against
terrorism
did
we
mention
that
there
s
a
war
against
terrorism
and
all
of
this
pushing
against
because
you
cant
say

no
and
make
it
go
away

when
you
shout

no
law
of
attraction
is
lining
that
up
youre
saying

no
i
dont
want
this
thing
the
way
im
feeling
right
now
the
way
im
feeling
right
now
wow
i
really
dont
like
this
feeling

and
its
there
wow
i
really
dont
like
this
feeling

and
its
there
you
know
the
antiwar
movement
creates
more
war
the
antidrug
movement
has
actually
created
more
drugs
because
were
focussing
on
what
we
dont
want
drugs
people
will
say

well
shouldnt
i
focus
upon
that
that
is
true
and
we
say
that
is
like
saying

because
someone
gave
their
attention
long
enough
that
now
it
is
manifested
i
should
do
it
too
and
we
say

we
dont
really
understand
that
reasoning
mother
theresa
was
brilliant
she
said
mother
theresa
was
brilliant
she
said
if
you
have
a
peace
rally

invite
me
you
know

she
knew

she
understood
the
secret
i
mean
look
what
she
manifested
in
the
world
so
if
youre
antiwar

be
propeace
if
you
are
antia
particular
politician
often
elections
are
tipped
in
the
favour
of
the
person
because
hes
getting
all
the
energy
and
all
the
focus
you
want
to
focus
on
its
ok
to
notice
what
you
dont
want
well
this
is
what
i
do
want
or
talk
about
how
bad
it
is
read
about
all
of
that
all
the
time
well
youre
creating
more
of
that
you
know

so
many
times
people
say
to
me
maybe
you
have
to
be
informed
learn
to
become
still
and
to
take
your
attention
away
from
what
you
dont
want
and
all
the
emotional
charge
around
it
and
place
the
attention
on
what
you
wish
to
experience
i
always
say
when
the
voice
and
the
vision
on
the
inside
than
the
opinions
on
the
outside
youve
mastered
your
life
youre
not
here
to
try
to
get
the
world
to
be
just
like
you
want
it
to
be
you
are
here
to
create
the
world
around
you
that
you
choose
while
you
allow
the
world
as
others
choose
it
to
be
to
exist
also
one
of
the
questions
i
get
asked
all
the
time
and
thats
the
idea
that
if
well

if
everyone
uses
the
secret
and
they
all
treat
the
universe
like
a
catalogue
arent
we
going
to
run
out
of
stuff
wont
everyone
just
make
a
run
for
it
and
bust
the
bank
whats
so
beautiful
about
the
teaching
of
the
great
secret
is
that
there
s
more
than
enough
to
go
around
for
everyone
and
that
lie
is
theres
lack
and
there
s
limitation
and
there
s
just
not
enough
that
lie
and
those
thoughts
of
fear

greed

stinginess
and
lack
become
their
experience
so
the
world
has
taken
a
nightmare
pill
theres
more
than
enough
creative
ideas
theres
more
than
enough
love
theres
more
than
enough
love
theres
more
than
enough
joy
that
is
aware
of
its
own
infinite
nature
every
great
teacher
who
has
ever
walked
the
planet
has
told
us
that
life
was
meant
to
be
abundant
and
so

just
when
we
think
that
resources
are
dwindling
we
find
new
resources
to
achieve
the
same
things
so
even
though
we
say
we
have
lack
its
because
we
dont
open
up
our
vision
and
see
all
of
what
is
around
us
you
know
when
everyone
starts
to
live
from
their
heart
they
dont
go
for
the
same
things
we
dont
want
bmws
we
dont
all
want
the
same
person
we
dont
all
want
the
same
experiences
we
dont
all
want
the
same
clothing
we
dont
all
want
the
theres
enough
for
everyone
thats
the
truth
so
let
the
variety
of
your
reality
thrill
you
as
you
get
to
choose
from
among
it
and
when
you
see
something
that
you
want
in
your
experience
make
it
your
reality
by
becoming
a
match
to
it
and
when
you
see
those
things
that
you
are
not
wanting
in
your
experience
do
not
talk
about
them
don
not
write
about
them
don
not
write
about
them
dont
push
against
them
remove
your
attention
from
the
things
that
you
do
not
want
while
you
give
your
undivided
attention
most
of
the
leaders
in
the
past
missed
the
great
part
of
the
secret
which
is
empowering
and
sharing
with
others
this
is
the
best
time
to
have
ever
been
alive
in
history
its
the
first
time
weve
ever
had
the
power
when
we
look
around
us

even
at
our
own
bodies
what
we
see
is
the
tip
of
the
iceberg
think
of
this
for
a
moment
now
your
hand
looks
solid

but
its
really
not
or
whether
it
s
a
star
everything
is
energy
and
let
me
help
you
understand
that
just
a
little
bit
theres
the
universe

of
course
and
then
individuals
and
then
inside
of
this
body
are
organ
systems
and
then
there
s
cells
and
then
there
s
molecules
and
then
there
s
atoms
and
then
there
is
energy
so
there
are
a
lot
of
levels
to
talk
about
something
on
i
dont
care
what
city
youre
living
in
youve
got
enough
power
in
your
body

potential
power
to
illuminate
the
whole
city
for
nearly
a
week
most
people
define
themselves
by
this
finite
body
but
youre
not
a
finite
body
i
mean

even
under
a
microscope
youre
an
energy
field
what
we
know
about
energy
is
this
you
go
to
a
quantum
physicist
and
you
say
what
creates
the
world
energy
well
describe
energy
its
moving
into
form

through
form
and
out
of
form
you
go
to
a
theologian
and
you
ask
the
question
and
he
or
she
will
say

god
and
he
or
she
will
say

god
never
can
be
created
or
destroyed
always
moving
into
form

through
form
and
out
of
form
you
see

it
s
the
same
description

just
different
terminology
and
so

if
you
think
youre
this
meat
suit
running
around
think
again
youre
a
spiritual
being
were
all
connected
we
just
dont
see
it
everything
in
the
universe
is
connected
it
is
just
one
energy
field
you
are
extensions
of
source
energy
you
are
here
in
these
magnificent
bodies
you
are
source
energy
you
are
eternal
beings
you
are
that
which
you
call
god
scripturally
we
could
say
that
we
are
the
image
and
the
likeness
of
god
we
could
say
that
we
are
all
of
that
would
be
true
every
great
tradition
has
told
you
that
you
were
created
in
the
image
and
the
likeness
of
the
creative
source
that
means
that
you
have
god
potential
and
power
and
maybe
youve
created
things
to
this
point
and
maybe
you
havent
the
question
id
ask
you
to
consider
is
do
the
results
you
have
in
your
life

are
they
what
you
really
want
and
are
they
worthy
of
you
if
theyre
not
worthy
or
you

then
when
would
now
because
you
have
the
power
to
do
that
you
know

a
lot
of
people
feel
like
theyre
victims
in
life
and
theyll
often
point
to
past
events
perhaps
growing
up
with
an
abusive
parent
or
and
i
would
add
as
a
parenthesis
here
so
its
like

all
of
a
sudden
youre
not
so
unique
from
the
age
of
thirteen
to
eighteen
i
was
involved
in
street
gangs
i
had
a

severe
motorcycle
accident
i
was
homeless
at
one
point
in
dallas
when
i
was
a
child
i
had
learning
difficulties
and
i
was
told
i
would
never
read
write
or
communicate
never
amount
to
anything

not
go
very
far
in
life
i
mean

that
s
almost
everybody
s
story
in
some
form
or
not
so
thats
just
called

so
what
because
you
can
either
keep
focusing
on
that
and
when
people
start
focusing
on
what
they
want
we
are
wanting
you
to
come
to
the
place
where
you
are
beginning
to
offer
your
thought
deliberately
where
youre
guiding
your
thoughts
on
purpose
where
you
are
the
creator
of
your
own
experience
the
beautiful
thing
about
the
law
of
attraction
is
and
you
can
begin
to
think
and
you
can
begin
to
generate
within
yourself
the
law
will
begin
to
respond
to
that
or
you
have
the
belief
that
or
you
have
the
belief
that
we
can
create
it
the
way
we
want
it
and
you
can
break
yourself
free
from
your
hereditary
patterns
and
prove
once
and
for
all
is
greater
than
the
power
thats
in
the
world
some
of
you
may
be
thinking

well
thats
very
nice
she
wont
let
me
do
that
or
im
not
rich
enough
to
do
that
or
im
not

im
not

im
not

im
not

im
not

im
not
every
single
im
not

is
a
creation
are
there
any
limits
to
this
absolutely
not
are
there
any
limits
to
this
absolutely
not
we
are
unlimited
beings
we
have
no
ceiling
that
is
within
every
single
individual
that
is
on
this
planet
is
unlimited
there
is
no
blackboard
in
the
sky
theres
no
blackboard
in
the
sky
that
says
colon
and
all
i
have
to
do
to
really
understand
what
im
doing
here
why
im
here
and
find
out
what
god
really
has
in
mind
for
me
but
the
blackboard
doesnt
exist
so
your
purpose
is
what
you
say
it
is
your
mission
is
the
mission
you
give
yourself
your
life
will
be
what
you
create
it
as
it
took
a
lot
of
years
for
me
to
get
this
and
if
i
wasnt
doing
it
i
was
like
and
when
i
really
got
that
my
primary
aim
then
i
began
to
do
only
those
things
which
brought
me
joy
we
have
a
saying

you
know
joy

love

freedom
thats
what
it
is
sitting
there
and
meditating
for
an
hour

by
golly

do
that
if
you
experience
joy
eating
a
salami
sandwich
when
i
pet
my
cat
im
in
a
state
of
joy
when
i
walk
in
nature
im
in
a
state
of
joy
so
i
want
to
constantly
put
myself
in
that
state
and
what
i
want
manifests
so
inner
happiness
actually
is
the
fuel
of
success
anything
that
makes
you
feel
good
is
always
going
to
be
drawing
in
more
you
are
listening
to
this
program
right
now
its
you
that
drew
this
into
your
life
and
its
your
choice
whether
you
want
to
take
it
and
utilise
it
if
it
doesnt
feel
good

then
you
know

let
it
go
find
something
that
feels
good

that
resonates
with
your
heart
joseph
campbell
said

follow
your
bliss
we
think
those
are
the
best
words
we
have
ever
heard
spoken
from
a
human
tongue
and
if
one
could
follow
one
s
bliss
to
abundance
and
wellbeing
on
all
subjects
enjoy
life
with
us
its
a
magnificent
trip
you
will
live
in
a
different
reality
well
the
only
thing
that
is
different
is
that
you
work
with
the
secret
and
then
you
can
do
and
have
and
be
things
that
people
once
said
that
s
impossible
for
you
were
really
now
moving
into
a
new
era
its
the
era
where
the
last
frontier
is
not
space
but
its
going
to
be
mind
i
see
a
future
of
unbounded
potential
remember
were
using
at
most

of
the
potential
of
the
human
mind
human
potential

is
the
result
of
proper
education
so
imagine
a
world
where
people
were
using
we
could
go
anywhere
see
yourself
with
the
good
that
you
desire
every
religious
book
tells
us
that
every
great
book
on
philosophy
every
great
leader
all
the
avatars
who
have
ever
lived
go
back
and
study
the
wise
ones
many
of
them
have
been
presented
to
you
in
this
program
you
know
what
now
you
understand
it
and
the
more
you
use
it

the
more
youll
understand
it
you
may
be
feeling
that
it
would
be
easier
to
be
hearing
these
words
if
they
had
come
to
you
the
first
day
of
your
experience
upon
this
earth
and
if
we
were
talking
to
you
we
would
say
to
you
welcome
to
planet
earth
there
is
nothing
that
you
cannot
be
or
do
or
have
you
are
magnificent
creator
and
you
are
here
by
your
powerful
and
deliberate
wanting
to
be
here
go
forth
attracting
life
experience
to
help
you
decide
what
you
want
and
once

your
real
work

upon
what
you
want
that
is
the
process
of
creating
i
believe
that
youre
great
regardless
of
what
has
happened
to
you
in

for
sure
be
easy

fun
with
it
although
each
of
the
worlds
countries
would
like
to
dispute
this
fact
we
french
know
the
truth
the
best
food
in

chef
gusteaus
cookbook

anyone
can
cook
but
not
everyone
celebrates
its
success
amusing
title

anyone
can
cook
and

no

i
dont
think
anyone
can
do
it
this
is
me
i
think
its
apparent
i
need
to
rethink
my
life
a
little
bit
whats
my
problem
first
of
all

im
a
rat
which
means
life
is
hard
flour

eggs

sugar

vanilla
bean
oh
small
twist
of
lemon
whoa

you
can
smell
all
that
you
have
a
gift
this
is
emile

my
brother

hes
easily
impressed
so
you
can
smell
ingredients
so
what
so
you
can
smell
ingredients
so
what
this
is
my
dad

hes
never
impressed
he
also
happens
to
be
the
leader
of
our
clan
so

whats
wrong
with
having
highly
developed
senses
whoa

whoa

whoa
dont
eat
that
whats
going
on
here
turns
out
that
funny
smell
was
rat
poison
suddenly

dad
didnt
think
my
talent
was
useless
i
was
feeling
pretty
good
about
my
gift
until
dad
gave
me
a
job
clean
thats
right

poison
checker
cleanerino
close
to
godliness
which
means
clean

you
know

cleanliness
is
close
to
well

it
made
my
dad
proud
now

dont
you
feel
better

remy
youve
helped
a
noble
cause
noble
were
thieves

dad
and
what
were
stealing
is

lets
face
it

garbage
it
isnt
stealing
if
no
one
wants
it
if
no
one
wants
it

why
are
we
stealing
it
if
no
one
wants
it

why
are
we
stealing
it
lets
just
say
we
have
different
points
of
view
this
much
i
knew
if
you
are
what
you
eat

then
i
only
want
to
eat
the
good
stuff
but
to
my
dad
food
is
fuel
you
get
picky
about
what
you
put
in
the
tank

your
engine
is
gonna
die
now
shut
up
and
eat
your
garbage
look

if
were
going
to
be
thieves
why
not
steal
the
good
stuff
in
the
kitchen
where
nothing
is
poisoned
first
of
all

we
are
not
thieves
secondly

stay
out
of
the
kitchen
and
away
from
the
humans
its
dangerous
i
know
im
supposed
to
hate
humans
they
dont
just
survive

they
discover

they
create
they
dont
just
survive

they
discover

they
create
i
mean

just
look
at
what
they
do
with
food
how
can
i
describe
it
good
food
is
like
music
you
can
taste

color
you
can
smell
there
is
excellence
all
around
you
you
need
only
be
aware
to
stop
and
savor
it
oh

gusteau
was
right
oh

mmm

yeah
each
flavor
was
totally
unique
but
combine
one
flavor
with
another
and
something
new
was
created
so
now
i
had
a
secret
life
the
only
one
who
knew
about
it
was
emile
hey

emile

emile
he
doesnt
understand
me

but
i
can
be
myself
around
him
why
are
you
walking
like
that
i
dont
want
to
constantly
have
to
wash
my
paws
did
you
ever
think
about
how
we
walk
on
the
same
paws
you
ever
think
about
what
we
put
into
our
mouths
you
ever
think
about
what
we
put
into
our
mouths
when
i
eat

i
dont
want
to
taste
everywhere
my
paws
have
been
well

go
ahead
but
if
dad
sees
you
walking
like
that

hes
not
going
to
like
it
what
have
you
got
there
you
found
cheese
and
not
just
any
cheese

tomme
de
ch�vre
de
pays
that
would
go
beautifully
with
my
mushroom
this
rosemary
this
rosemary
with
maybe
with
a
few
drops
from
this
sweet
grass
well

throw
it
on
the
pile

i
guess

and
then
weii
you
know
we
dont
want
to
throw
this
in
with
the
garbage

this
is
special
but
were
supposed
to
return
to
the
colony
there
are
possibilities
unexplored
here
there
are
possibilities
unexplored
here
we
got
to
cook
this
now

exactly
how
we
cook
this
is
the
real
question
the
key
is
to
keep
turning
it
get
the
smoky
flavor
nice
and
even
that
storms
getting
closer
hey

remy

you
think
that
maybe
we
shouldnt
be
so
you
got
to
taste
this
this
is
its
got
this
kind
of
its
burny

melty
what
would
you
call
that
flavor
lightningy
yeah

its
lightningy
we
got
to
do
that
again
okay

when
the
next
storm
comes

well
go
up
on
the
roof
saffron

why
do
i
get
the
feeling
its
in
the
kitchen
its
in
the
kitchen
saffron

like

that
oh

him

nobody

he
is
part
of
the
kitchen
no

hes
a
plongeur
or
something
he
washes
dishes
or
takes
out
the
garbage

he
doesnt
cook
but
he
could

uh

no
anyone
can
cook
well

yeah

anyone
can

that
doesnt
mean
that
anyone
should
well

that
is
not
stopping
him

see
what
is
he
doing
no

no
no

this
is
terrible
hes
ruining
the
soup

and
nobodys
noticing
its
your
restaurant

do
something
what
can
i
do
i
am
a
figment
of
your
imagination
but
hes
ruining
the
soup
we
got
to
tell
someone
that
hes
hot
open
oven
tonight

id
like
to
present
the
foie
gras
is
this
going
to
become
a
regular
thing
with
you
you
know
how
to
fix
it

this
is
your
chance
the
soup
where
is
the
soup
out
of
my
way
the
soup
where
is
the
soup
out
of
my
way
move
it

garbage
boy
you
are
cooking
how
dare
you
cook
in
my
kitchen
where
do
you
get
the
gall
to
even
attempt
something
so
monumentally
idiotic
i
should
have
you
drawn
and
quartered
ill
do
it

i
think
the
law
is
on
my
side
larousse

draw
and
quarter
this
man
after
you
put
him
in
the
duck
press
to
squeeze
the
fat
out
of
his
head
what
are
you
blathering
about
the
soup
stop
that
soup
waiter
linguini
flred
fired
she
wants
to
see
the
chef

he
ego
solene
leclaire
leclaire
what
did
she
say
she

the
soup
wait

what

am
i

of
telling
you
so
if
she
write
a
review
to
that
effect
hes
a
garbage
boy

who
made
something
she
liked
how
can
we
claim
to
represent
the
name
of
gusteau
if
we
dont
uphold
his
most
cherished
belief
and
what
belief
is
that

mademoiselle
tatou
anyone
can
cook
perhaps
i
have
been
a
bit
harsh
on
our
new
garbage
boy
he
has
taken
a
bold
risk
and
we
should
reward
that

as
chef
gusteau
would
have
if
he
wishes
to
swim
in
dangerous
waters
who
are
we
to
deny
him
you
were
escaping
oh

yeah
since
you
have
expressed
such
an
interest
in
his
cooking
career
you
shall
be
responsible
for
it
anyone
else
then
back
to
work
you
are
either
very
lucky
or
very
unlucky
they
think
you
might
be
a
cook

insane
would

a
refrigerator

from
a
the
rat
i
saw
it
what
are
you
doing
in
here
im
just
familiarizing
myself
with

you
know

the
vegetables
and
such
get
out
one
can
get
too
familiar
with
vegetables

you
know
that

close

you
okay
up
there
how
did
you

strangely
involuntary

the
same
crazy
idea
where

you
taking
me
wait
wait

im
sorry
�
votre
sant�
that

but
youll
need

be
responsible
for
teaching

women
do
you
see
in
this
kitchen
how
many
women
do
you
see
in
this
kitchen
only
me

why
do
you
think
that
is
well

i
only
me

why
do
you
think
that
is
well

i
because
haute
cuisine
is
an
antiquated
hierarchy
built
upon
rules
written
by
stupid
old
men
rules
designed
to
make
it
impossible
for
women
to
enter
this
world
but
still
im
here

how
did
this
happen
because

well

because
you
because
i
am
the
toughest
cook
in
this
kitchen
ive
worked
too
hard
for
too
long
to
get
here
and
i
am
not
going
to
jeopardize
it
for
some
garbage
boy
who
got
lucky
easy
to
cook

easy
to
eat

gusteau
makes
chinese
food
chineeasy
excellent
work

fran�ois

as
usual

its
good

isnt
it
i
want
you
to
work
up
something
for
my
latest
frozen
food
concept
gusteaus
corn
puppies
theyre
like
corn
dogs

only
smaller

bite
size
what
are
corn
dogs
cheap
sausages
dipped
in
batter
and
deep
fried

you
know

american
whip
something
up
maybe
gusteau
in
overalls
and
huckleberry
tom
hat
or
as
a
big
ear
of
corn
in
doggie
makeup
yes

but

please

with
dignity
get
my
lawyer
well

the
will
stipulates
i
know
what
the
will
stipulates
what
i
want
to
know
is
if
this
letter
if
this
boy
changes
anything
theres
not
much
resemblance
theres
no
resemblance
at
all

he
is
not
gusteaus
son
gusteau
had
no
children

and
what
of
the
timing
of
all
this
the
deadline
in
the
will
expires
in
less
than
a
month
suddenly

some
boy
arrives
with
a
letter
from
his
recently
deceased
mother
claiming
gusteau
is
his
father
highly
suspect
this
is
gusteaus
yes

yes

yes
may
i
of
course
but
the
boy
does
not
know
she
claims
she
never
told
him

or
gusteau

and
asks
that
i
not
tell
why
you
what
does
she
want
a
job
for
the
boy
why
you
what
does
she
want
a
job
for
the
boy
only
a
job
well

yes
then
what
are
you
worried
about
if
he
works
here
youll
be
able
to
keep
an
eye
on
him
while
i
do
a
little
digging
find
out
how
much
of
this
is
real
mark
my
words

whole
thing
is

the

wiped

human
life
slowly

surely

the
earth
began
to
wither
and
die
the
few
survivors
that
were

learnt
to
keep
on
the
move
we
avoided
major
cities

if
we
stopped
in
a
place
too
long

they
would
be
drawn
to

only
a
few
at
first

but
then
more
and
more
a
never
ending
army
of
the
undead

biohazard
numbers
increasing
gentlemen
gentlemen
dr
isaacs
general
wesker
as
one
is
we
now
know
conclusively
that
they
have
no
real
need
for
sustenance
they
hunger
for
flesh

but
do
not
require
it
what
news
of
project
alice
using
antibodies
from
her
blood
i
will
develop
a
serum
that
will
not
just
combat
the
effects
of
the
tvirus
but
potentially
reverse
it
giving
back
these
creatures
a
measure
of
their
intelligence
their
memories
thus
curving
down
their
hunger
for
flesh
youre
confident
you
can
domesticate
them
they
are
animals
essentially
we
can
train
them
if
we
can
take
away
their
basic
instincts
theyll
never
be
human
but
would
provide
the
basis
for
a
docile
work
force
we
can
return
to
the
surface
after
months
of
experiments
you
have
got
nothing
to
show
and
we
are
underground
without
the
original
project
alice

progress
has
been
difficult
ive
been
forced
to
replicate
her
using
flawed
genetic
models
the
results
are
unpredictable
project
alice
and
the
subject
of
domestication
is
of
the
highest
priority
youll
concentrate
on
this
and
exclude
all
other
research
i
expect
and
updated
report
within
a
week
simply
demanding
results
will
not
guarantee
them
then
perhaps
we
should
get
someone
else
in
charge
someone
who
can
give
us
the
reassurances
we
require
continue
with
your
research

dr
isaacs
another
spike
of
abnormal
activity
has
been
detected
of
probabilities
that
this
is
project
alice
triangulate

find
the
location
impressive
if
it
is
her

her
development
is
extraordinary
her
powers
seem
to
have
grown
in
a
geometric
rate
since
her
escapre
from
the
facility
youve
made

trips
to
the
surface
in
the
last

hours
all
unauthorized
any
trips
to
the
surface

specially
to
gather
fresh
specimen

puts
my
men
at
risk
why
did
you
disobeyed
orders

sir
isaacs
my
research
has
intensified
dont
worry

theyre
perfectly
secured
youre
supposed
to
be
domesticating
them
sometimes
aggression
has
its
uses
what
could
you
possibly
needs
these
things
for
specimen

has
reached
the
final
state
of
the
test
grid
perfect

put
her
on
the
screen
good
girl
that
it
is
what
tries
he
knows
what
he
needs
to
know
i
do
not
understand
your
remark
my
research
will
change
the
face
of
everything
when
you
pick
a
side
choose
the
right
one
this
belongs
to
you
gave
it
to
you
last
night
for
luck
k
mart
its
where
they
found
me
claire
and
the
others
a
few
years
back
you
have
another
name
never
liked
it
and
everybody
i
knew
is
dead
seemed
like
time
for
a
change
somebody
wants
to
say
something
alice

this
is
claire
redfield
shes
the
one
that
put
this
convoy
together
thank
you
so
much
for
your
help
excuse
me

something
needs
my
attention
last
six
months
we
all
signed
up
for
the
convoy
pretty
soon
therell
be
more
of
us
dead
than
alive
alice

what
happened
to
you
why
did
you
leave
after
we
they
were
looking
for
me
they
were
tracking
me
i
couldnt
be
around
you

any
of
you
i
would
have
got
you
all
killed
thats
why
you
disappeared
broke
into
an
umbrella
facility
hacked
into
their
computers

downloaded
satellite
trajectories
stayed
off
the
grid
after
the
world
ended
why
stay
out
on
your
own
its
safer
if
i
dont
go
around
people
but
youve
come
back
chase
carlos

it
is
why

is
there
somewhere
youve
got
to
be
i
guess
i
must
be
moving
on
welcome
home
everyone
is
grateful
to
you
for
helping
us
out
how
long
are
you
going
to
stay
dont
get
me
wrong
we
are
grateful
theyre
all
talking
about
what
you
did
and
they
are
scared
i
dont
blame
them
people
have
in
getting
rid
of
me
not
just
you
youre
positive
its
her
to
great
a
chance
to
pass
up
if
it
is
project
alice

shes
been
evading
the
satellite
grid
for
years
ive
rerouted
the
remaining
satellites
to
reaquire
the
subject
and
shell
be
unaware
of
us
ill
have
an
strike
team
ready
within
the
hour
no

well
establish
a
positive
identification
first
the
group
shes
with
includes
known
associates
the
original
project
alice
is
vital
to
my
research
the
whole
process
of
domestication
is
in
her
blood
her
genetic
structure
is
the
key
the
longer
we
leave
her
out
there
the
greater
the
chance
we
lose
her
again
i
cant
risk
that
that
decision
isnt
yours
to
make
thats
an
order
claire

the
tranmissions

its
the
best
we
alaska
we
have
to
check
it
out
we
cant
just
ignore
it
have
you
any
idea
what
kind
of
journey
that
would
be
yeah

a
long
one
and
at
the
end
of
it

what
you
have
no
guarantee
there
is
even
anyone
alive
up
there
claire

these
transmissions
say
they
are
dated
six
months
ago
how
many
radio
broadcasts
have
be
responded
to
how
many
times
have
we
go
the
transmissions
say
there
is
no
infection
up
there
its
isolated
it
is
safe
the
people
in
this
convoy
trust
me
with
their
lives
these
people
dont
need
pipe
dreams
thats
exactly
what
they
need
six
months
ago

there
were

of
us
then
now
there
is
less
than
were
starting
to
give
up
they
need
somekind
of
hope
we
made
a
decision
to
make
and
too
big
its
too
important
for
me
to
make
it
for
you
there
is
a
change
there
are
survivors
in
alaska
there
is
a
chance
that
the
infection
hasnt
reached
that
far
but
we
dont
know
for
sure
we
stay
as
we
are
or
we
travel
to
alaska
for
alaska
we
will
leave
soon
i
hope
youre
right
the
food
is
virtually
gone
trucks
are
running
on
empty
ive
got
half
a
tank
of
gas
thats
it

chase
shit

i
dont
even
have
empty

i
have
enough
for

miles
all
right

if
were
going
to
make
this
trip

were
going
to
need
to
resupply
these
are
our
options
the
nearest
safest
bet
is
right
there
its
empty

i
tried
there
we
could
try
this
we
could
try
this
were
limping
and
were
short
in
gasoline
and
supplies
vegas
is
too
damn
dangerous
we
have
traveled
every
small
town
for
the
last
the

months
we
have
traveled
every
small
town
for
the
last
the

months
we
have
to
go
to
the
big
city
vegas
is
our
only
bet
well
establish
a
positive
identification
first
this
good
the
committee
authorizes
immediate
action
release
of
vehicules

your

said
two
officers

be
in
danger
but

know
who
were
not
causing
any
panic
if
detective
hoffman
or

precinct
is
in
danger
i
think
they
should
know
it
thats
your
call
making
any
progress
were
fine

your

when

a
reflection
evil

born
evil

born

and
followed
the

an
old
tale
and
a
variation
a
little
girl

full
of

is
that
our
set
yeah
lts
not

yet
theres
smithies
house
smithies
house
i
should
have
guessed
you
two
professionals
would
be
here
early
and
beavering
away
were
just
laying
about
drinking
capuccino
devon
makes
a
great
capuccino
care
for
one
thanks

but
prey
and
l
just
had
a
cup
of
tea
actually

it
was
a
terrible
cup
of
tea
at
the
commissary
terrible
is
an
adequate
description
of
it
well

l
thought
since
were
here
and
smithie
sites
been
started
we
might
go
over
some
of
the
scenes
that
take
place
there
not
the
love
scene

of
course

but
some
of
the
earlier
scenes
that
indicate
so
beautifully
your
character
lets
take

for
instance

scene
the
scene
where
devon
you
arrive
billy

at
smithies
house
to
find
sue

nikki
looking
out
the
window
i
remember
the
scene
well
go
through
it
and
then
well
maybe
take
it
on
the
set
and
plug
it
out
as
possible
i
guess
we
should
just
jump
right
in
that
would
be
jolly
good

ok
and

lll
start
it
off
on
page
nikki

this
is
just
a
rough
runthrough

place
its
headquarters

a
secret
society
whole
summer

voldermort

so
uptight

heard
the
chatting

had
something
more
interesting
harry
has
the
right
to
know
if
it
wasnt
him

no
one
know
hes
back
hes
hardly
a
child

molly

but
not
an
adult
either
hes
not
your
son
hes
not
your
son
no
one
else
hes
got

he
still
has
to
me
potter

grow
up
into
a
criminal
stay
out
of
this

severus

shit
i
do
not

for
what
dumbledore
said
hermione

i
hate
your
cat
well
be
eating
down
in
the
kitchen
well
be
eating
down
in
the
kitchen
just
because
youre
allowed
to
use
magic
now
you
hungry

harry
it
is
very
peculiar
it
seems
that
your
hearing
at
the
ministry
is
to
be
before
the
entire
withem
i
dont
understand
why
is
the
ministry
of
magic
go
against
me
hed
find
out
soon
enough
the
boy
who
lies
fudge
all
is
well
fudge
is
using
all
his
power
including
his
influence
at
the
daily
prophet
smear
anyone
who
claims
the
dark
lord
has
returned
the
minister
thinks
dumbledores
after
his
job
but
thats
insane

no
one
in
the
right
mind
would
believe
that
dumbledore
excatly
the
point

fudge
isnt
in
his
right
mind
hes
been
twisted
and
walked
by
fear
fear
makes
people
do
a
lot
of
things
the
last
time
voldermort
gain
power
he
almost
destroyed
everything
we
hold
on
stand
now
he
has
returned

im
afraid
the
minister
will
do
almost
anything
to
avoid
facing
the
terrifying
truth
we
think
voldermort
wants
to
build
up
his
army
again
years
ago
he
had
huge
armies
in
his
command
hes
been
recruiting

weve
been
attempted
to
do
the
same
but
gathering
followers
isnt
the
only
thing
hes
interested
we
believe
voldermort
may
be
after
something
something
he
didnt
have
last
time
you
mean

like
a
weapon
no

thats
enough

hes
just
a
boy
you
say
much
more

you
might
as
well
inducting
him
to
the
order
good

i
want
to
join
if
voldermorts
recruiting
the
army
then
i
want
to
fight

are
hereby

our
message
that
the
time
and
place
of
the
hearing
has
been
changed

did
you
i
must
have
missed
it
but
by
mistake

i
arrived
at
the
ministry

hours
early
charges
the
charges
against
the
accused
are
as
follows
that
he
did
knowingly
that
he
did
knowingly
but
use
the
petrunas
charm
in
the
presence
of
a
muggle
do
you
deny
producing
said
petrun
and
you
were
aware
that
youre
forbidden
from
using
magic
yes

of
course

but
i
was
only
doing
it
because
of
the
dementors
dementors
in
little
winchik
thats
very
clever
muggles
cant
see
dementors

can
they

boy
im
not
lying

there
were

of
them

if
i
hadnt
im
sorry
to
interrupt
what
have
showed
in
a
very
well
heard
story
but
since
you
can
produce
not
witnesses
of
the
event
i
admit

minister

where
as
it
happens

we
can
please
describe
the
attack
what
did
they
look
like
not
the
boys

the
dementors
alright

they
are
big
clothed
then
everything
went
cold
like
all
of
the
happiness
had
gone
from
the
world
now

look
here
dementors
dont
just
wander
into
a
muggle
suburban
happen
to
cross
with
a
wizard
the
odds
are
termolecule
i
dont
think
anyone
wouldve
believe
i
dont
think
anyone
wouldve
believe
im
sure
i
mustve
misunderstood
you

professor
dementors
are
out
of
all

under
the
control
of
ministry
of
magics
so
silly
but
it
sounded

for
moment
as
though
youre
suggesting
that
the
ministry
had
ordered
the
attack
on
this
boy
that
would
be
disturbing
indeed

madam
undersecretary
which
claim
for
the
ministry
to
put
a
full
scale
enquiry
and
why
they
attack
without
the
authorization
of
course
there
is
someone
who
might
be
behind
the
attack
cornelius

i
employ
you
to
see
wiz
the
evidence
the
dark
lord
have
returned
is
incontrovertible
ln
the
matter
of
harry
potter
the
law
say
in
this
states
that
magic
may
be
used
before
muggles
in
life
threatening
situation
laws

be
changed
if
necessary

a
vital
importance
although
each
headmaster
has
brought
something
new
to
this
historic
school
progress
of
the

the
prophet

your
stupid
mother

you
everything
you
need
to
know
ill
tell
you
everything
you
need
to

disturbingly
uneven
youll
be
following
a
carefully
structured
youll
be
following
a
carefully
structured
there
isnt
something
about
using
the
defensive

my
classroom
we
arent
using
magics
youll
be
learning
about
defensive
spells
in
a
secure

risksfree
way

gonna
be
attacked

it
wont
be
risksfree
do
raise
their
hands
when
speak
in
my
class
its
the
view
of
the
ministry
that
a
theoretical
knowledgell
be
sufficient
is
what
schools
are
all
about
and
hows
theories
supposed
to
prepare
us
for
out
there
theres
nothing
out
there

dear
who
do
you
imagined

this
quiet
plan

large
once
again

a
lie
this
isnt
a
lie

according
to
your

times

most
wonderful
person
ive

i

whats
wrong
with
your
hand
youve
gotta
tell
dumbledore
no

dumbledores
got
enough
in
his
mind
rite
now
anyway
i
wont
get
umbridges
satisfaction
bloody
hell
she
was
torturing
you
if
your
parents
know
about
this
yeah

i
havent
got
any
parents

have
i
harry

youve
gotta
report
this
it
is
very
simple
no

is
not
hermione

be
what
it
is
is
not
thus
simple
but
i
want
to
understand
dear
malfoot

i
hope
youre
alrite
its
getting
cooler
here
winters
definitely
on
the
way
despite
ive
been
back
to
hogwarts

i
feel
more
alone
than
ever
i
know
you
but
all
people
will
understand
hello
harry
potter
your
feet

arent
you
cold
a
bit
unfortunately
of
my
shoes
of
mystery
have
disappeared
suspect
who
narguil�s
be
for
tr�s
of
this
what
are
they
the
carl
pastro
theyre
gentle
really

but
people
avoid
them
because

theyve
been
different
why
cant
the
other
see
they
can
only
been
by
people
whos
in
death
so
you
know
someone
whos
gone
she
was
quiet
an
extraordinary
witch
she
did
a
lot
of
experiments
though
one
day

of
her
spells
went
badlt
wrong
i
was
it
wasnt
that
hard
i
do
feel
very
sad
about
it
sometimes
but
ive
a
dad
my
dad
and
i
believe
you
by
the
way
and
he
must
not
be
nameds
back
and
you
fought
him
everythings
extremely
tough
for
that
consipring
you
against
dumbledore
thanks

seems
that
youre
the
only
who
do
i
dont
think
thats
true
but
i
suppose
that
it
is
this
way
which
he
wants
you
if
you
feel
if
i
were
the
other
one
i
dont
want
you
to
feel
crowd
from
anyone
else
because
if
its
just
you
alone
you
arent
much
as
a
threat
would
you
ever
stop
eating
im
hungry
can
i
join
you
prof

what
exactly
are
you
insinuating
and
you
requesting
when
i
punished
my
students
you
conformed
to
prescribe
disciplinary
practices
seems
silly
but
certain
that
youre
questioning
my
authority
in
my
own
classroom
not
at
all

dolores
just
their
medieval
methods
but
to
question
my
practices
is
to
question
the
ministry
and
by
extension

the
minister
himself
im
a
tolerant
woman
but
the

thing
i
wont
stand
for
is
disloyalty
things
at
hogwarts
are
far
worse
than
i
feared
will
take
immediate
actions
what
happened
to
dumbledore
umbridge
revolutionised
the
teaching
of
defence
to
repress
the
seriously
falling
standards
of
hagwarts
school
just

question
youve
been
in
this
post
for
how
long
exactly
it
registered
before
for
the
position
in
the
defense
against
arts
of
the
darkness
is
that
correct
but
you
were
unsuccessful
would
you
please
predict
something

please
tiny
apocalypse
pity
no

waiti
think

do
see
something

yes
i
saw
something
dark
youre
in
a
great
danger
cho

whats
going
on
its
professor

trelawney
years
ive
been
here
to
teach
you
cant
do
this
actually
i
can
something
youd
like
to
say

dear
oh
therere
several
things
id
like
to
say
prof
mcgonagall
may
i
ask
you
to
escort
sybil
back
inside
sybil

come
here
dumbledore

may
i
remind
you
under
the
tone
of
educational
decree

as
it
acted
by
the
minister
youve
the
right
to
dismiss
my
teacher
but
you
dont
have
the
authority
to
banish
them
from
the
garden
that
power
remained
for
the
headmaster
for
now
dont
you
have
studying
to
do
professor
dumbledore
professor
professor
dumbledore
that
cursed
gargul
we
arent
learning
how
to
defend
ourselves
we
arent
learning
how
to
pass
our
owls
shes
taking
over
the
entire
school
securitys
and
will
remian
the
ministrys
top
priority
furthermore

weve
convincing
evidence
that
these
disappearances
are
the
work
of
what
are
you
doing
here
you
said
youre
worried
about
umbridge
whats
she
doing
trying
to
train
you
to
kill
the
halfbred
she
isnt
letting
us
to
use
magic
at
all
she
isnt
letting
us
to
use
magic
at
all
im
not
surprised
he
afraid
were
forming
some
sorta
wizard
army
thiss
exactly
what
he
thinks
that
dumbledore
is
assembling
his
own
forces
to
take
on
the
ministry
hes
becoming
more
crack
on
the
edge
the
others
wouldnt
want
me
to
tell
you
this

harry
things
arent
going
all
well

the
order
fudges
blocking
the
truth
these
disappearances
as
much
how
it
started
before
voldermort
is
on
the
move
what
do
we
do
someone
is
coming

im
sorry
i
cant
be
more
help
but
for
now

it
looks
like
youre
on
your
own
hes
out
there
isnt
he
weve
gotta
be
able
to
defend
ourselves
if
umbridge
refuses
to
teach
us
how
we
need
someone
wholl
this
is
mad

who
wants
me
teach
anything
im
a
nut

remember
you
cant
be
any
worse
than
her

anyway
thanks

ron
anything

mate
who
supposed
to
make
this
just
were
not
as
bad
well

at
least
safer
than
being
tracked
hi
we
know
why
were
here
we
need
a
teacher
proper
teacher
one
has
really
experienced
to
defend
himself
against
the
dark
arts
because
youknowswho
it
came
back

idiot
so
as
harry
says
so
dumbledore
says
before
harry
said
so
dumbledore
says
before
harry
said
the
point
is
wheres
the
proof
perhaps
harry
could
tell
us
more
about
diggory
got
killed
im
not
gonna
talk
about
cedric
that
isnt
why
youre
here

or
we
can
clear
up
now
come
on
hermione

lets
go

these
are
some
sorts
freaks
is
that
true
you
can
teach
us
chant
ive
seen
it
i
dont
know
you
can
do
that
he
killed
a
basalese
with
a
sword
in
dumbledores
office
and
last
year
he
really
did
fight
who
went
to
flash
ln
fact

i
was
just
lucky
i
didnt
know
what
i
was
doing
half
of
the
time
hes
just
being
modest
no

hermione

im
not
facing
these
stuff
in
real
life
isnt
like
in
school
it
isnt
like
you
made
a
mistake
you
can
try
just
try
again
tomorrow
but
out
there
when
youre
a
second
away
from
being
murdered
or
watching
a
friend
die
rite
before
your
eyes
you
dont
know
how
its
like
youre
rite

harry

we
dont
thats
why
we
need
your
help
because
the
one
we
try
of
beating
voldermort
hes
coming
back
st
we
need
to
find
a
place
where
umbridge
wont
find
out
thats
too
small
harry

what
happened
if
umbridge
does
find
out
harry

what
happened
if
umbridge
does
find
out
i
meanits
exciting

isnt
it
breaking
the
rules
who
are
you
and
what
did
with
hermione
granger
finally

at
least
know
a
thing
certainly
of
this
meeting
for
the
next
few
days
we
should
all
come
to
this
place
and
practise
we
gotta
make
sure
umbridge
wont
find
out
this
place
all
student
organisations
disbanded
watch
way
youre
going
it
where
is
going
longbottom
you
got
neville
you
found
the
room
needs
thiss
also
called
comeandgoroom
the
room
only
appears
when
a
persons
immediate
needs
and
always
is
equiped
with
that
it
is
needed
charming
really
but
yes
it
is
this
the
idea
its
great
just
like
hogwarts
wants
to
fight
back
youre
just
flourishing
your
stick
too
much

try
like
this
would
you
please
copy
your
whole
text

times
to
ensure
maximum
attention

dont
need
to
talk

stunning
is
one
of
the
sorceries
more
useful
in
your
arsenal

an
essential
artifice
for
the
sorcerer

nigel
expelliarmus

my
intention

submit
to
questioning
come

you
want
a
cup
of
tea
focus
on
the
fixed
point

try
again
a
little
higher
im
ok
reducio
working
hard
is
important

theres
something
be
out
this
even
more
believing
in
yourself

this

every
great
wizard
in
history
started

nothing
more
than
what

place
some
vomitilhas
in
the
umbridges
tea
or
febricolate

you
stay
with
some
full
furuncles
sounds
great

guys

would
you
excuse
me
i
heard
umbridge
gave
you
a
hard
time
the
other
day
its
worth
it
justlearning
all
these
made
me
wonder
maybe
he
would
cedricgave
me
all
these
stuff
he
was
really
good
youre
a
really
good
teacher

harry
ive
never
been
interested
in
any
of
these
before
a
visgo
it
probably
is
full
of
narguil�s
what
s�o
narguil�s
well

how
was
it
i
mean
she
was
sorta
crying
not
that
bad

are
you
im
sure
harrys
kisisngs
more
than
satisfactory
chos
been
half
of
the
time
crying
these
days
i
bet
a
longer
kiss
will
cheer
her
up
you
dont
know
how
she
must
be
feeling
confused
to
like
harry

it
feels
blamed
by
t�
him
kissed
in
conflict
with
umbridge
who
wants
fire
her
mother
of
the
ministry
a
person
can
not
feel
all
this
that
is
because
your
emotional
side
it
belongs
to
the
size
of
a
teaspoon
voldemort
oughts
to
be
behind
something
something
that
he
not
it
got
of
the
last
time
in
the
dream

you
was
it
close
to
the
victim
or
i
sell
the
scene
of
the
high
none
of
the
two
teacher

it
can
tell
what
is
happening
everardo
it
assure
of
him
who
is
found
by
the
right
people
mr

dilys
tell
them
who
arthur
weasley
is
seriously
wounded
and
that
his
sons
are
going
to
arrive
soon
there

by
the
portal
key
they
are
already
with
him
target
it
was
almost
but
they
think
it
is
going
to
survive
once
again
the
lord
of
the
darkness
it
did
not
get
acquired
her
look
at
me
what
is
happening
to
with
me
it
wanted
to
see
me

director
severo

i
fear
not
we
can
expect
most
if
not

we
will
be
vulnerable
it
seems
that
there
is
a
connection
comes
in
the
mind
of
the
lord
of
the
darkness
and
yours
if
he
already
knows
about
this
connection

do
not
yet
know
pray
so
that
he
continue
to
know
it
means

which
if
he
knows
about
her
read

control
it
formerly
was
common
the
lord
of
the
darkness
creating
projected
images
for
tortur�
them
until
the
madness
only
when
it
did
them
implore
by
the
death

he
finally
killed
nestas
classes
i
am
going
to
try

in
your
mind
and
you
are
going
to
try
to
resist

attacked

i
wasnt
just
watch
i
was
the
snake
and
afterwards
dumbledores
office
this
connection
between
me
and
voldermort
the
reason
for
it
is
that

just
feel
so
angry
all
the
time
something
gave
wrong
within
me
i

to
the
world

spliting
to
good
people
and
deaths
people
got
both
bright
and
dark
inside
what
matters
is
about
choose

my
health
of
the
health
yes
breathe
a
pure
air

you
know
if
i
were
you

i
shouldnt
get
too
used
to
being
back
in
fact
that
is
highly
secret

right
dumbledore
sending
me
to
party
with
the
giants
giant
did
you
find
them
well

they
arent
that
hard
to
be
found

to
be
honest
i
talked
to
them
to
join
the
class
but
i
wasnt
the
only
one
who
tried
to
win
them
over
guests
of
the
death

yes
trying
to
persuade
them
to
join
you
know
whom
i
gave
him
dumbledores
mesage
supposed
someonell
remember
he
was
great
to

i
supposed
and
did
they
do
that
to
you
not
exactly
go
on

you
have
it

dolvy
dog
its
strange
out
there

just
like
last
time
it
has
a
tempest
arriving

harry
we
all
must
be
ready
when
she
does
we
confirm
that

prisoners
extremely
dangerous
of
course
the
prime
minister
bundle
was
warned
of
the
danger
we
have
a
great
suspicion
we
strongly
suspect
the
breakout
was
interfered
notorious
mass
murderer

sirius
black
he
is
cousin
of
the
fugitive

belatrix
lestrange
mass
breakout
from
azkaban
dumbledore
warned
fudge
of
this
happened
he
is
going
to
finish
killing
for
not
facing
the
truth
i
i
wanna
apologize
now
until
my
mother
tells
that
the
prophet
is
not
so
right
so

what
im
really
trying
to
say
is
that
i
believe
in
you
years
ago
a
death
eater
named
bellatric
lestrange
used
to
excruciate
to
my
parents
i
have
much
pride
of
being
son
of
them
but
im
not
sure
im
ready
for
anyones
notice
yet
we
will
do
them
if
they
make
proud

neville
make
it
a
power
memory

happiest
thing
to
remember
continue
tried

simas
right

it
is
your
time
now
a
fully
proto
is
the
most
difficult
to
achieve
a
shield
forms
also
been
equally
used
fantastic
gina
just
remember

it
can
protect
you
as
long
as
youre
focus
then
they
concentrate
luna
think
of
happier
thing
than
can

expecto
patronum
im
trying
i
know

its
good
i
am
going
to
find
a
way
in
this
catch
them
i
am
observing
them
there
are
weeks

see
dumbledores
army
proved

thats
what
ive
been
telling
you
all
your
fears
coming
back

you
know
who

this
isnt
just
from
it
we
saw
what
her
lies
are
naturally
no
prof
he
did
not
have
anything
to
see
with
that

was
i
very
noble
of
your
part
harry

try
protect
me
but
how
was
pointed

the
name
tells
clearly
i
instructed
harry
the
form
this
organization
and
i

just
i

am
responsible
for
the
activities
dolores

saveboat

youll
escort
dumbledore
to
wait
the
trial
for
conspiracy
and
influence
i
thought
it
might
not
be
the
circumstance
you
seem
to
leave
of
the
principle
of
the
idea
that
i
will
go
how
was
the
sentence
good

go
talk
the
following
ive
no
intention
of
going
to
azkaban
already
it
arrives
do
not
like
his
minister
but
it
ca
not
deny
dumbledores
his
style
boys
and
girls
cant
stay
the
less
than

centimeters
each
other
the
ones
that
they
want
to
join
to
me
in
the
brigade
inquisitorial
it
should
repress
the
several
illicit
activities
you
did
all
that
it
could
even
dumbledore
couldnt
stop
it
harry

if
anyones
faults
its
ours
it
is

we
convince
you
it
is

but
i
agreed
i
tried
so
hard
to
help
i
managed
to
worsen
the
things
now
it
no
longer
matters
anymore
because
i
ca
not
play
more
with
who
imports
too
much
the
more

have
to
lose
perhaps
be
better

so
riot
theyre
dangerous

vindicated
umbridge
suspended
pending
investigation
hogwarts
headmaster
reinstated
i
know
how
you
feel

harry
i
knew
it
was
only
a
matter
of
time
i
thought
make
distance
for
myself
from
you
like
i
had
over
the
year

hell
be
less
tempted
and
therefore
you
might
be
more
protected
the
prophecy
said
it
means

one
of
us
whos
gonna
kill
the
other
in
the
end
why
he
did
not
tell
me
got
the
same
reason
you
try
to
save
sirius
same
as
your
friends
save
you
after
all
these
years

after
all
youve
suffered
i
didnt
wanna
cause
you
anymore
pain
i
worry
too
much
with
you
why
is
not
it
in
the
party
i
lost
all
my
things
probably
people
have
been
hiding
that
is
horrible
it
is
alone
joke

this
is
the
last
night

i
really
do
need
it
back
it
wants
help
to
search
im
sorry
about
your
godfather

dont
want
any
help
looking
anyway

my
mom
always
said
things
we
lose
have
a
way
coming
back
to
us
in
the
end
not
always
in
the
way
we
expect
i
think
i
am
going
to
eat
pudding
ive
been
thinking
about
what
dumbledore
said
to
me
what
is
despite
terms
one
battle
by
the
front
weve
got
one
thing
voldermort
doesnt
have
we
shall
not
cease
from
exploration
and
the
end
of
all
our
exploring
will
be
to
arrive
where
we
started
and
know
the
place
for
the
first
time
after
the
game
is
before
the
game

s

herberger
after
the
game
is
before
the
game

s

herberger
probably
the
most
mysterious
species
on
our
planet
a
mystery
of
unanswered
questions
who
are
we
where
do
we
come
from
where
are
we
going
how
do
we
know
what
we
think
we
know
why
do
we
believe
anything
at
all
countless
questions
in
search
of
an
answer
an
answer
that
will
give
rise
to
a
new
question
and
so
on
but

in
the
end

isnt
it
always
the
same
question
and
always
the
same
answer
the
ball
is
round

the
game

beautiful
downtown

about
that

folks
may
i
assume
this
charming
young
lady
is
your
daughter
she
is
my
wife
what
happens
in
vegas
stays
in
vegas
whats
your
name
yhunkihong
would
you
be
kind
enough
to
join
me
up
on
the
stage
please
are
you
serious
about
this
guy
this
is
a
joke
going
behind
some
mimes
and
clowns
while
were
in
it
yhunkihong
what
if
i
told
you
that
that
pretty
necklace
your
wearing
wouldnt
that
be
something
wouldnt
that
just
blow
your
mind
yeah

yes

wouldnt
it
blow
all
your
minds
three

two

one
somebody
said
spooky
wait
a
minute

look
at
your
glass

where
did
it
go
yhunkihong

why
dont
you
look
inside
my
pocket
reach
in

dig
deep
lets
have
a
big
hand
for
yhunkihong
well
thats
magic
folks

and
thats
why
im
here
they
probably
seen
a
lot
of
those
shows
mentalists

magicians

illusionists
it
would
be
shocked
to
know
that
sometimes
not
often

but
sometimes

its
the
real
deal
masquerading
as
an
act
hiding
behind
a
few

dollar
tricks
hiding
in
a
plain
sight
because
if
the
magician
doesnt
do
that
the
alternative
is
impossible
for
others
to
live
with
anyway

wednesday
nights
the
back
page
doesnt
pay
very
well
so
i
gamble
but
i
dont
play
against
other
people

only
against
the
house
so

no
mega
jack
pots

no
wash
outs
the
idea
is
to
be
unnoticed
that
way
i
can
keep
coming
back
im
not
a
god
i
cant
see
everyones
future

only
my
own
and
only
within

minutes
except
for
when
i
saw
her
but
well
come
back
to
that
there
is
no
pattern
to
this
guy

he
is
all
over
the
map
hes
not
counting

not
enough
the
top
of
that
deck
isnt
it
that
two
bit
magic
act
that
called

in
the
car
here

oh

thanks
hey

did
you
hear
the
joke
about
the
zen
master
who
ordered
a
hot
dog
he
said
he
would
have
one
with
everything
what
we
have
theyre
in
the
cliffhanger
motel
outside
flagstaff
we
found
an
arizona
foreman
who
remembers
the
land
cruiser
how
did
they
do
that
the
road
was
floaded
and
he
was
about
to
suggest
a
place
to
stay
but
johnson
already
knew

right
exactly
callie

it
just
got
worse
all
right
people

we
got
a
nuclear
alert

code
red
nuclear
emergency
search
teams
are
on
the
way

but
until
they
get
here
somebody
please
tell
me
what
my
agency

the
fbi
are
doing
about
it
well

sir

two
main
suspects
have
been
interrogated
cars
and
primacies
have
been
checked
we
have
opened
up
surveillance
on

or

suspects
but
nothing
actionable
yet
all
was
that
we
are
doing
waiting
for
something
actionable
there
are

million
lives
that
are
precaurious
at
best
so
i
say
we
widen
this
net
to
slightly
suspicious
allright

callie

what
do
you
propose
we
do
next
i
believe
that
the
urgency
of
the
situation
compels
the
use
of
any
and
all
resources
to
obtain
chris
johnson
we
know
where
he
is

let
my
team
pick
him
up
we
know
where
he
is

let
my
team
pick
him

mobilizing

watching

the
image

said

mobilising
standard
procedure
when
security

escalated

there
is
an
italian
painter
named
carlatti
defined
beauty
he
said
it
was
a
summation
of
the
parts
working
together
in
such
a
way
that
that
nothing
needed
to
be
added
taken
away
or
altered
youre
beautiful

was
incredible
over
here

this
is
a
good
stand

our

there
it
is
hatch
to
the

it
doesnt

iike
a

was
a
dud
but
the
triggering
charge
biew
out
a
yard
section
of
the
pipe
and
bond
but
i
have
a
gift
for
you
something
that
beionged
to
my
father
he
wouid
have
wanted
you
to
have
it
he
often
spoke
of
how
compassionateiy
you
advised
him
on
the
best
course
of
action
during
my
kidnapping
its
very
vaiuabie

i
just
couidnt
iet
it
expiode
with
the
rest
of
him
i
was
very
upset
when
the
money
didnt
kiii
both
of
you
i
didnt
think
id
get
another
chance
then
you
dropped
the
answer
right
in
my
iap
and
as
you
say

hes
the
best
you
have
or
shouid
i
say

had
take
her
to
the
heiicopter
come

jump

jump

jump
do
you

do
you
wanna
put
that
in
engiish
for
those

they
did
take

the
heart
of
the
ocean

mr

i
said
you
wanted
to
take
the
call
all
right

you
have
my
attention

rose
can
you
tell
us
who
the
woman
in
the
picture
is
oh

yes
shes
a
goddamned
liar
some
nutcase
seeking
money
or
publicity
rose
dewitt
bukater
died
on
titanic
when
she
was
next
month
so
shes
a
very
old
goddamned
liar
ive
done
the
background
on
this
woman
back
to
the
s
when
she
was
working
as
an
actress
theres
your
first
clue

sherlock
her
name
was
rose
dawson
back
then
everybody
who
knows
about
the
diamond
doesnt
exactly
travel
light

does
she
mrs
calvert

im
brock
lovett
lets
get
her
inside
hi

ms
calvert
hi

welcome
to
the
keldysh
hey
yes
have
you
met
my
granddaughter
lizzy
she
takes
care
of
me
we
metjust
a
few
minutes
ago
remember

nana
up
on
deck
there

thats
nice
have
to
have
my
pictures
when
i
travel
is
there
anything
youd
like
yes
which
disappeared
in
about
that
time
old
louis
lost
everything

from
the
neck
up
the
theory
goes
that
the
crown
diamond
was
chopped

too
recut
into
a
heart
shape
that
became
known
as
the
heart
of
the
ocean
it
was
a
dreadful

heavy
thing
i
only
wore
it
this
once
i
tracked
it
down
through
insurance
records
an
old
claim
that
was
settled
under
terms
of
absolute
secrecy
can
you
tell
me
who
the
claimant
was

rose
nathan
hockley

thats
right
the
claim
was
for
a
necklace
his
son
caledon
bought
his
fianc�e
you
a
week
before
he
sailed
on
titanic
it
was
filed
right
after
the
sinking
so
the
diamond
had
to
have
gone
down
with
the
ship
you
see
the
date
she
was
wearing
the
diamond
the
day
the
titanic
sank
and
that
makes
you
my
new
best
friend
these
are
some
of
the
things
we
recovered
from
your
stateroom
this
was
mine
how
extraordinary
and
it
looks
the
same
as
it
did
the
last
time
i
saw
it
the
reflection
has
changed
a
bit
are
you
ready
to
go
back
to
titanic
okay

here
we
go

she
hits
the
berg
on
the
starboard
side

right
she
bumps
along

punching
holes
along
the
side

below
the
waterline
then
the
forward
compartments
start
to
flood
which
dont
go
any
higher
than
e
deck
so
now
as
the
bow
goes
down

the
stern
rises
up
until
shes
got
her
whole
ass
up
in
the
air

a
big
ass
were
talking



tons

okay
the
hulls
not
designed
to
deal
with
that
pressure

so
what
happens
two
hours
and

minutes
after
the
collision
the
bow
section
planes
away

landing
about
half
a
mile
away
pretty
cool

its
all
steerage
is
there
another
passenger
list
theres
no
other
list
the
confrontation
you
had
with
your
wife
the
night
she
was
murdered
lt
was
very
bitter
she
said
she
was
glad
l
knew

that
she
hated
all
the
sneaking
around
and
she
said
that
she
wanted
a
divorce
in
reno
what
was
your
response
l
told
her
l
would
not
grant
one
l�ll
see
you
in
hell
before
l
see
you
in
reno
those
were
your
words

according
to
your
neighbors
lf
they
say
so
l
really
don�t
remember

l
was
upset
what
happened
after
you
argued
with
your
wife
she
packed
a
bag
she
packed
a
bag
to
go
and
stay
with
mr

quentin
glenn
quentin

golfpro
at
the
snowden
hills
country
club
whom
you
had
discovered
was
your
wife�s
lover
did
you
follow
her
l
went
to
a
few
bars
first
later

l
drove
to
his
house
to
confront
them

they
weren�t
home
l
parked
in
the
turnout
and
waited
and
waited
i
think
when
they
arrived

you
went
up
to
the
house
and
murdered
them
l
was
sobering
up
along
the
way

l
threw
my
gun
into
the
royal
river
l�ve
been
very
clear
on
this
point
l
get
hazy
where
the
cleaning
woman
shows
up
the
following
morning
and
finds
your
wife
in
bed
with
her
lover
riddled
with
caliber
bullets
does
that
strike
you
as
a
fantastic
coincidence

or
is
it
just
me
yes

it
does
before
the
murders
took
place
that�s
very
convenient
the
police
dragged
that
river
for
three
days

and
nary
a
gun
was
found
so
no
comparison
could
be
made
between
your
gun
and
the
bullets
taken
from
the
bloodstained
corpses
of
the
victims
and
that
also
is
very
convenient

lsn�t
it

mr

dufresne
since
l
am
innocent
of
this
crime
l
find
it
decidedly
inconvenient
that
the
gun
was
never
found
ladies
and
gentlemen

you�ve
heard
all
the
evidence
we
have
the
accused
at
the
scene
of
the
crime

we
have
footprints
bullets
on
the
ground
bearing
his
fingerprints
a
broken
bourbon
bottle

likewise
with
fingerprints
and
most
of
all
we
have
a
beautiful
young
woman
and
her
lover
lying
dead
in
each
other�s
arms
they
had
sinned
but
was
their
crime
so
great
as
to
merit
a
death
sentence
while
you
think
about
that
think
about
this
a
revolver
holds
six
bullets

not
eight
l
submit
that
this
was
not
a
hotblooded
crime
of
passion
that
at
least
could
be
understood

if
not
condoned
no
four
bullets
per
victim
not
six
shots
fired

but
eight
that
means
that
he
fired
the
gun
empty
and
then
stopped
to
reload
so
that
he
could
shoot
each
of
them
again
an
extra
bullet
per
lover
right
in
the
head
you
strike
me
as
a
particularly
icy
and
remorseless
man

mr

dufresne
lt
chills
my
blood
just
to
look
at
you
by
the
power
vested
in
me
by
the
state
of
maine
l
hereby
order
you
to
serve
two
life
sentences
backtoback
one
for
each
of
your
victims

so
be
it
we
see
you�ve
served

years
of
a
life
sentence
yes

sir

you
feel
you�ve
been
rehabilitated
yes

sir

absolutely

sir
l
mean

l
learned
my
lesson
l
can
honestly
say
that
l�m
a
changed
man

anyway
hadley
busted
his
head
up
pretty
good
doc
had
gone
home
for
the
night
poor
bastard
lay
there
till
this
morning
by
then

there
wasn�t
nothing
we
could
do
what
was
his
name
l
was
just
wondering
if
anyone
knew
his
name
what
the
fuck
do
you
care

new
fish
doesn�t
fucking
matter
what
his
name
was

he�s
dead
anybody
come
at
you
yet
anybody
get
to
you
yet
hey

we
all
need
friends
in
here
l
could
be
a
friend
to
you
hard
to
get
l
like
that
andy
kept
pretty
much
to
himself
at
first
i
guess
he
had
a
lot
on
his
mind
trying
to
adapt
to
life
on
the
inside
wasn�t
until
a
month
went
by
before
he
opened
his
mouth
to
say
more
than
two
words
to
somebody
as
it
turned
out
that
somebody
was
me
l�m
andy
dufresne
wifekilling
banker
why�d
you
do
it
l
didn�t

since
you
ask
you�re
going
to
fit
right
in
everybody
in
here�s
innocent

didn�t
you
know
that
what
you
in
here
for
didn�t
do
it

lawyer
fucked
me
rumor
has
it
you�re
a
real
cold
fish
you
think
your
shit
smells
sweeter
than
most

ls
that
right
to
tell
you
the
truth

l
haven�t
made
up
my
mind
l
understand
you�re
a
man
that
knows
how
to
get
things
l�m
known
to
locate
certain
things
from
time
to
time
l
wonder
if
you
might
get
me
a
rock
hammer
a
rock
hammer
what
is
it
and
why
what
do
you
care
for
a
toothbrush

l
wouldn�t
ask

l�d
quote
a
price
but
a
toothbrush
is
a
nonlethal
object

isn�t
it
fair
enough
a
rock
hammer
is
about
six
or
seven
inches
long
looks
like
a
miniature
pickax

pickax
for
rocks
quartz
and
some
mica

shale
limestone
so
l�m
a
rock
hound
at
least
l
was
in
my
old
life

l�d
like
to
be
again
or
maybe
you�d
like
to
sink
your
toy
into
somebody�s
skull
no

l
have
no
enemies
here
no
wait
a
while
word
gets
around
the
sisters
have
taken
quite
a
liking
to
you
especially
bogs
don�t
suppose
it
would
help
if
l
told
them
l�m
not
homosexual
neither
are
they
neither
are
they
bull
queers
take
by
force

that�s
all
they
want
or
understand
lf
l
were
you

l�d
grow
eyes
in
the
back
of
my
head
thanks
for
the
advice

well

that�s
free
you
understand
my
concern
lf
there�s
trouble

l
won�t
use
the
rock
hammer
then
l�d
guess
you
want
to
escape

tunnel
under
the
wall

maybe
what
did
l
miss
what�s
so
funny
you�ll
understand
when
you
see
the
rock
hammer
what�s
an
item
like
this
usually
go
for
seven
dollars
in
any
rockandgem
shop
my
normal
markup�s

percent
but
this
is
a
specialty
item
risk
goes
up

price
goes
up

let�s
make
it
an
even


bucks
ten
it
is
waste
of
money

if
you
ask
me
why�s
that
folks
around
this
joint
love
surprise
inspections
they
find
it

you�re
going
to
lose
it
lf
they
catch
you

you
don�t
know
me
mention
my
name

we
never
do
business
again
not
for
shoelaces
or
a
stick
of
gum

now
you
got
that
thank
you

mr
name�s
red
why
do
they
call
you
that
maybe
it�s
because
l�m
lrish
i
could
see
why
some
of
the
boys
took
him
for
snobby
he
had
a
quiet
way
about
him
a
walk
and
a
talk
thatjust
wasn�t
normal
around
here
he
strolled
like
a
man
in
the
park
without
a
care
or
a
worry
in
the
world
like
he
had
on
an
invisible
coat
that
would
shield
him
from
this
place
i
think
it�d
be
fair
to
say
i
liked
andy
from
the
start
let�s
go
some
of
us
got
a
schedule
to
keep
move
it
come
on

move
it
how
you
doing
how�s
the
wife
treating
you
andy
was
right
i
finally
got
thejoke
it
would
take
a
man
about

years
to
tunnel
under
the
wall
with
one
of
these
book
not
today
book
delivery
for
dufresne
we�re
running
low
on
hexite

get
on
back
and
fetch
us
up
some
this
will
blind
you
honey

hush
that�s
it

you
fight
better
that
way
i
wish
i
could
tell
you
andy
fought
the
good
fight
and
the
sisters
let
him
be
i
wish
i
could
tell
you
that
but
prison
is
no
fairytale
world
he
never
said
who
did
it
but
we
all
knew
things
went
on
like
that
for
a
while
prison
life
consists
of
routine
and
then
more
routine
every
so
often

andy
would
show
up
with
fresh
bruises
the
sisters
kept
at
him
sometimes
he
was
able
to
fight
them
off
sometimes
not
and
that�s
how
it
went
for
andy
that
was
his
routine
i
do
believe
those
first
two
years
were
the
worst
for
him
and
i
also
believe
that
if
things
had
gone
on
that

legal

ask

l
don�t
need
you
to
tell
me
where
the
bear

buckwheat
of
course
not

but
you
do
need
someone
to

that�ll
cost
you

a
lawyer
a
bunch
of
ballwashing
bastards
l

nearly
free

l�d
only
ask
three
beers
apiece
for
each
of
my
coworkers
coworkers

that�s
rich
a
man
working
outdoors
feels
more
like
a
man
if
he
can
have
a
bottle
of
suds

that�s
only
my
opinion
what
are
you
jimmies
staring
at
let�s
go
work
and
that�s
how
it
came
to
pass
that
on
the
secondtolast
day
of
thejob
the
convict
crew
that
tarred
the
factory
roof
in
the
spring
of
�
wound
up
sitting
in
a
row
at

in
the
morning
drinking
icycold
beer

courtesy
of
the
hardest
screw
that
ever
walked
a
turn
at
shawshank
state
prison
drink
up
while
it�s
cold

ladies
the
colossal
prick
even
managed
to
sound
magnanimous
we
sat
and
drank
with
the
sun
on
our
shoulders
and
felt
like
free
men
we
could
have
been
tarring
the
roof
of
one
of
our
own
houses
we
were
the
lords
of
all
creation
as
for
andy
he
spent
that
break
hunkered
in
the
shade
a
strange
little
smile
on
his
face
watching
us
drink
his
beer
want
a
cold
one
no

thanks

l
gave
up
drinking
you
could
argue
he
done
it
to
curry
favor
with
the
guards
or
maybe
make
a
few
friends
among
us
cons
if
only
for
a
short
while
lking
me
chess

now
there�s
a
game
of
kings

what
civilized

strategic
and
a
total
fucking
mystery

hate
it
let
me
teach
you
someday
sure
you�re
talking
to
the
right
man

get
things

upstate
to
my
knowledge

he
lived
out
the
rest
of
his
days
drinking
his
food
through
a
straw
andy
could
use
a
nice
welcome
back
when
he

and
they
made
me
librarian
in
and
have
you
ever
had
an
assistant
no

not
much
to
it

really
why
me
why
now
l
don�t
know
that�s
him

that�s
the
one
l�m
dekins
about
setting
up
some
kind
of
trust
fund
for
my
kids�
educations
why
don�t
we
have
a
seat
and
talk
it
over
do
you
have
a
piece
of
paper
and
a
pencil
mister
dekins
and
then
andy
says

mr

dekins
do
you
want
your
sons
to
go
to
harvard
or
yale
he
didn�t
say
that
he
didn�t
say
that
dekins
blinked
for
a
second
then
he
laughed
and
actually
shook
andy�s
hand
my
ass
shook
his
hand
l
tell
you

l
near
soiled
myself
all
he
needed
was
a
suit
and
tie
and
a
jiggly
hula
gal
on
his
desk
he�d
have
been
mr

dufresne

if
you
please
making
a
few
friends
l
wouldn�t
say
friends
l�m
a
convicted
murderer
who
provides
sound
financial
planning
lt�s
a
wonderful
pet
to
have
got
you
out
of
the
laundry

though
lt
might
do
more
than
that
how
about
expanding
the
library

get
some
new
books
lf
you
ask
for
something

ask
for
a
pool
table
how
do
you
expect
to
do
that
l
mean
get
new
books
in
here

mr

dufresne

if
you
please
l�ll
ask
the
warden
for
funds
six
wardens
have
been
through
here
in
my
tenure

and
l�ve
learned
one
immutable

universal
truth
not
one
born
whose
asshole
the
budget�s
stretched
thin
as
it
is

l
see
maybe
l
could
write
the
state
senate
and
request
funds
from
them
they
have
only
three
ways
to
spend
the
taxpayers�
money
for
prisons
more
walls

more
bars

more
guards
l�d
like
to
try

with
permission

a
letter
a
week
they
can�t
ignore
me
forever

sure
can
but
you
write
your
letters
if
it
makes
you
happy
l�ll
even
mail
them
for
you

how�s
that
so
andy
started
writing
a
letter
a
week
just
like
he
said
and
like
norton
said
andy
got
no
answers
the
following
april

he
did
tax
returns
for
half
the
guards
at
shawshank
year
after
that

he
did
them
all
including
the
warden�s
year
after
that

they
rescheduled
the
intramural
season
to
coincide
with
tax
season
the
guards
on
the
opposing
teams
all
remembered
to
bring
their
ws
so
moresby
prison
so
moresby
prison
right

the
holster
too
that�s
taxdeductible

you
can
write
that
off
yes

sir
andy
was
a
regular
cottage
industry
in
fact

it
got
so
busy
at
tax
time

he
was
allowed
a
staff
could
you
hand
me
a
stack
of

s
got
me
out
of
the
wood
shop
a
month
out
of
the
year

and
that
was
fine
by
me
and
still

he
kept
sending
those
letters
lt�s
brooks
watch
the
door
please

brooks
please

brooks
stay
back

goddamn
it
what�s
going
on
one
second
he�s
fine

then
out
come
the
knives
we
can
talk
about
this

right
there�s
nothing
to
talk
about

l�ll
cut
his
fucking
throat
what�s
he
done
to
you
lt�s
what
they
done
l
got
no
choice

won�t
hurt
heywood

all
know
that
right

heywood

he�s
a
friend
of
yours

a
reasonable
man
right

so
put
the
knife

his
neck

god�s
sake

where

get
a
gun
and
rob
the
foodway
so
they�d
send
me
home
i
could
shoot
the
manager
while
i
was
at
it

sort
of
like
a
bonus
i
guess
i�m
too
old
for
that
sort
of
nonsense
anymore
i
don�t
like
it
here
i�m
tired
of
being
afraid
all
the
time

decided

doubt
they�ll
kick
up
any
fuss
not
for
an
old
crook
like
me
l
doubt
they�ll
kick
up
any
fuss

not
for
an
old
crook
like
me

dufresne
andy

let
me
out
i
have
no
idea
to
this
day
what
those
two
italian
ladies
were
singing
about
truth
is

i
don�t
want
to
know
some
things
are
best
left
unsaid
i
like
to
think
it
was
something
so
beautiful
it
can�t
be
expressed
in
words
and
makes
your
heart
ache
because
of
it
i
tell
you

those
voices
soared
higher
and
farther
than
anybody
in
a
gray
place
dares
to
dream
it
was
like
a
beautiful
bird
flapped
into
our
drab
cage
and
made
those
walls
dissolve
away
and
for
the
briefest
of
moments
every
last
man
at
shawshank
felt
free
it
pissed
the
warden
off
something
awful
dufresne

open
this
door
turn
that
off
l
am
warning
you

turn
that
off
you�re
mine
now
andy
got
two
weeks
in
the
hole
for
that
little
stunt
hey

look
who�s
here

maestro
you
couldn�t
play
something
good

huh
like
hank
williams
they
broke
the
door
down
before
l
could
take
requests
was
it
worth
two
weeks
easiest
time
l
ever
did
no
such
thing
as
easy
time
in
the
hole

a
week
in
the
hole
is
like
a
year
damn
straight

l
had
mr

mozart
to
keep
me
company
so
they
let
you
tote
that
record
player
down
there

huh
lt
was
in
here
that�s
the
beauty
of
music

they
can�t
get
that
from
you
haven�t
you
ever
felt
that
way
about
music
well

l
played
a
mean
harmonica
as
a
younger
man
lost
interest
in
it

though
didn�t
make
much
sense
in
here
here�s
where
it
makes
the
most
sense
you
need
it
so
you
don�t
forget
forget
forget
places
in
the
world
that
aren�t
made
out
of
stone
there�s
something
that
they
can�t
get
to
that
they
can�t
touch
that�s
yours
what
are
you
talking
about
let
me
tell
you
something

my
friend
hope
is
a
dangerous
thing
hope
can
drive
a
man
insane
lt�s
got
no
use
on
the
inside
you�d
better
get
used
to
that
idea
like
brooks
did
says
here
that
you�ve
served

years
of
a
life
sentence
you
feel
you�ve
been
rehabilitated
l
can
honestly
say
l�m
a
changed
man
no
danger
to
society
here
absolutely
rehabilitated
jesus

when
you
say
it
like
that
you
wonder
where
it
went
l
wonder
where


years
went
here
went
through
one
of
your
competitors
l
hope
you
don�t
mind

l
wanted
it
to
be
a
surprise
lt�s
very
pretty
you
going
to
play
it
roll
in
andy
was
as
good
as
his
word
he
wrote
two
letters
a
week
instead
of
one
in


the
state
senate
finally
clued
in
to
the
fact
they
couldn�t
buy
him
off
withjust
a

check
appropriations
committee
voted
an
annual
payment
of
just
to
shut
him
up
and
you�d
be
amazed
how
far
andy
could
stretch
it
he
made
deals
with
book
clubs

charity
groups

bought

we
the
rest
of
us
did
our
best
to
pitch
in
when
and
where
we
could
by
the
year
kennedy
was
shot
andy
had
transformed
a
storage
room
smelling
of
turpentine
into
the
best
prison
library
in
new
england
complete
with
a
fine
selection
of
hank
williams
that
was
also
when
warden
norton
instituted
his
famous
inside
out
program

remember
reading
about
it

papers
and
got
his
picture
in

lt�s
no

lt�s
no

outside
these
walls
performing
all
manner
of
public
service
of
an
honest
day�s
labor
and
provide
a
service
to
the
community
at
a
bare
minimum
of
expense
to
mr

and
mrs

john
q

taxpayer
of
course
he
didn�t
tell
the
press
that
bare
minimum
of
expense
is
a
fairly
loose
term
there
are

different
ways
to
skim
off
the
top
men

materials

you
name
it
and
oh

my
lord

how
the
money
rolled
in
at
this
rate

you�ll
put
me
out
of
business
with
this
pool
of
slave
labor

you
can
underbid
any
contractor
in
town
we�re
providing
a
valuable
community
service
that�s
fine
for
the
papers

but
l�ve
got
a
family
to
feed
we
go
back
a
long
way

need
this
highway

it
and
l
go
under

that�s
a
fact
you
have
some
of
this
fine
pie
my
missus
made
for
you

you
think
about
that
l
wouldn�t
worry
too
much
about
this
contract
l
already
got
my
boys
committed
elsewhere
you
be
sure
and
thank
maisie
for
this
fine
pie
and
behind
every
shady
deal
behind
every
dollar
earned
there
was
andy

the
books
two
deposits
two
deposits
get
my
stuff
to
the
laundry

two
suits
for
dryclean
and
a
bag

thank
you

sir
he�s
got
his
fingers
in
a
lot
of
pies

from
what
l

he�s
got
scams
you
haven�t
even
dreamed
of

lkickbacks
on
his
kickbacks
a
river
of
dirty
money
running
through
here
sooner
or
later

he�ll
have
to
explain
where
it
came
from
that�s
where
l
come
in
l
channel
it

filter
it

funnel
it
stocks

securities

taxfree
municipals
l
send
it
out
into
the
real
world

and
when
it
comes
back
clean
as
a
virgin�s
honeypot

huh
cleaner
by
the
time
norton
retires

l�ll
have
made
him
a
millionaire
lf
they
ever
catch
on

he�ll
wind
up
in
here
wearing
a
number
himself
l
thought
you
had
more
faith
in
me
than
that
l
know
you�re
good

but
all
that
paper
leaves
a
trail
now
anybody
gets
curious

fbl

lrs
whatever
all
right

who
all
right

who
who
he�s
the
guilty
one

the
man
with
the
bank
accounts
lt�s
where
the
filtering
process
starts
they
trace
anything

it�ll
just
lead
to
him
but
who
is
he
but
who
is
he
l
conjured
him
l
conjured
him
he
doesn�t
exist

except
on
paper
you
can�t
just
make
a
person
up
sure
you
can

if
you
know
how
the
system
works
lt�s
amazing
what
you
can
accomplish
by
mail
mr

stevens
has
a
birth
certificate
driver�s
license

social
security
you�re
shitting
me
you�re
shitting
me
a
figment
of
my
imagination
did
l
say
you
were
good
shit

you
are
rembrandt
the
funny
thing
is
on
the
outside

l
was
an
honest
man

straight
as
an
arrow
l
had
to
come
to
prison
to
be
a
crook
ever
bother
you
l
don�t
run
the
scams

l
just
process
the
profits
a
fine
line

maybe
but
l
also
built
that
library
and
used
it
to
help
guys
get
their
high
school
diploma
why
do
you
think
he
lets
me
do
all
that
lkeep
you
happy
and
doing
the
laundry
money
instead
of
sheets
well

l
work
cheap

that�s
the
tradeoff
tommy
williams
came
to
shawshank
in
on
a
twoyear
stretch
for
b
and
e
that�s
breaking
and
entering
to
you
cops
caught
him
sneaking
tv
sets
out
the
back
door
of
a
jc
penney
young
punk
young
punk
cocky
as
hell
come
on

old
boys

moving
like
molasses
making
me
look
bad
we
liked
him
immediately
l�m
backing
out
the
door
and
l
got
the
tv
like
this
a
big
old
thing

l
couldn�t
see
shit

then
l
hear
this
voice
freeze

kid

hands
in
the
air
l
was
standing
there

holding
onto
that
tv

finally
the
voice
says
you

but
if
l

easy
piece
of
time

programs
not
like
here

like
here
l�ve
been
in
and
out
since
l
was
name
it

chances
are
l�ve
been
there
perhaps
you
should
try
a
new
profession
what
l
mean
is
you�re
not
a
very
good
thief

you
should
try
something
else
yeah

what
the
hell
you
know
about
it

capone
what
are
you
in
for
a
lawyer
fucked
me
everybody�s
innocent
in
here

don�t
you
know
that
as
it
turned
out

tommy
had
himself
a
young
wife
and
a
new
baby
girl
maybe
he
thought
of
them
on
the
streets
or
his
child
growing
up
not
knowing
her
daddy
whatever
it
was
whatever
it
was
thought
l
might
try
for
my
high
school
equivalency

you
helped
a
couple
of
fellas
with
that
l
don�t
waste
time

tommy
under
his
wing
started
walking
him
through
his
abc�s
tommy
took
to
it
pretty
well
too
boy
found
brains
he
never
knew
he
had
before
long

andy
started
him
on
his
course
requirements
he
really
liked
the
kid
gave
him
a
thrill
to
help
a
youngster
crawl
off
the
shit
heap
but
that
wasn�t
the
only
reason
prison
time
is
slow
time
so
you
do
what
you
can
to
keep
going
some
fellas
collect
stamps
others
build
matchstick
houses
andy
built
a
library
now
he
needed
a
new
project
tommy
was
it
it
was
the
same
reason
he
spent
years
shaping
and
polishing
those
rocks
the
same
reason
he
hung
his
fantasy
girlies
on
the
wall
in
prison
in
prison
by


right
about
the
time
tommy
was
getting
ready
to
take
his
exams

was
lovely
raquel
well

for
shit
l
wasted
a
whole
year

my
time

this
bullshit

probably
not
that
bad
l
didn�t
get
a
thing

been
in
chinese

of
you
we�re
old
friends

know
him
as
good
as
anybody
smart
fellow

ain�t
he
smart
as
they
come

he
was
a
banker
on
the
outside
what�s
he
in
here
for
anyway
murder
you
wouldn�t
think
it
to
look
at
the
guy
caught
his
wife
in
bed
with
some
golf
pro

greased
them
both
about
four
years
ago
l
was
in
thomaston
on
a
twotothree
stretch
l
stole
a
car
lt
was
a
dumbfuck
thing
to
do
about
six
months
left
to
go
l
get
a
new
cellmate
in
big

twitchy
fucker
lkind
of
roomie
you
pray
you
don�t
get

you
know
what
l�m
saying
sixtotwelve

armed
burglary
said
he
pulled
hundreds
of
jobs
hard
to
believe

highstrung
as
he
was

you
cut
a
loud
fart

he
jumped
three
feet
talked
all
the
time
too

that�s
the
other
thing

he
never
shut
up
places
he�d
been
in
jobs
he�d
pulled

women
he
fucked
even
people
he
killed
people
who
gave
him
shit
that�s
how
he
put
it
so
one
night

like
a
joke
l
say
to
him

elmo

who
did
you
kill
so
l
could
case
all
these
big
rich
pricks
that
come
in
so
l
pick
out
this
guy
go
in
one
night
and
do
his
place
he
wakes
up
and
gives
me
shit
so
l
killed
him
him
and
this
tasty
bitch
he
was
with
and
that�s
the
best
part
she�s
fucking
this
prick

see
this
golf
pro

but
she�s
married
to
some
other
guy
some
hotshot
banker
and
he�s
the
one
they
pinned
it
on
l
have
to
say
that�s
the
most
amazing
story
l
ever
heard
what
amazes
me
most
is
you�d
be
taken
in
by
it
lt�s
obvious
this
fellow
williams
is
impressed
with
you
he
hears
your
tale
of
woe
and
naturally
wants
to
cheer
you
up
he�s
young

not
terribly
bright
lt�s
not
surprising
he
wouldn�t
know
what
a
state
he
put
you
in
sir

he�s
telling
the
truth
let�s
say
for
the
moment
this
blatch
does
exist
you
think
he�d
just
fall
to
his
knees
and
cry

yes

l
did
it

l
confess
by
the
way

add
a
life
term
to
my
sentence
with
tommy�s
testimony

l
can
get
a
new
trial
that�s
assuming
blatch
is
still
there
chances
are

he�d
be
released
by
now
how
can
you
be
so
obtuse
obtuse

ls
it
deliberate
you�re
forgetting
yourself
the
country
club
will
have
his
old
timecards
records

ws
with
his
name
on
them
lf
you
want
to
indulge
this
fantasy

it�s
your
business
don�t
make
it
mine

this
meeting
is
over
lf
l
got
out

l�d
never
mention

talk
out
here
l�m
asking
you
to
keep
this
conversation
just
between
us
l
feel
awkward
enough
as
it
is
we
got
a
situation
here
l
think
you
can
appreciate
that
l
tell
you

son

this
thing
really
came
along
and
knocked
my
wind
out
lt�s
got
me
up
nights

that�s
the
truth
the
right
thing
to
do
sometimes
it�s
hard
to
know
what
that
is
do
you
understand
l
need
your
help

son
lf
l�m
going
to
move
on
this
there
can�t
be
the
least
little
shred
of
doubt
l
have
to
know
l
have
to
know
yes

sir
would
you
be
willing
to
swear
before
a
judge
and
jury
with
your
hand
on
the
good
book
and
take
an
oath
before
almighty
god
himself
just
give
me
that
chance
that�s
what
l
thought
l�m
sure
by
now
you�ve
heard
terrible
thing
a
man
that
young
less
than
a
year
to
go

trying
to
escape
broke
captain
hadley�s
heart
to
shoot
him
truly

it
did
we
just
have
to
put
it
behind
us
move
on
l�m
done
everything
stops
get
someone
else
to
run
your
scams
nothing
stops
nothing
or
you
will
do
the
hardest
time
there
is
no
more
protection
from
the
guards
l�ll
pull
you
out
of
that

bunk
hilton
and
cast
you
down
with
the
sodomites
you�ll
think
you�ve
been
fucked
by
a
train
and
the
library
gone
sealed
off

brick
by
brick
we�ll
have
us
a
little
book
barbecue
in
the
yard
they�ll
see
the
flames
for
miles
we�ll
dance
around
it
like
wild
lnjuns
you
understand
me
catching
my
drift
or
am
l
being
obtuse
give
him
another
month
to
think
about
it
my
wife
used
to
say
l�m
a
hard
man
to
know
like
a
closed
book
complained
about
it
all
the
time
she
was
beautiful
god

l
loved
her
l
didn�t
know
how
to
show
it

that�s
all
l
killed
her

red
l
didn�t
pull
the
trigger
but
l
drove
her
away
that�s
why
she
died

because
of
me
the
way
l
am
that
don�t
make
you
a
murderer
bad
husband

maybe
feel
bad
about
it
if
you
want

but
you
didn�t
pull
the
trigger
no

l
didn�t
somebody
else
did
and
l
wound
up
in
here
bad
luck

l
guess
lt
floats
around
lt�s
got
to
land
on
somebody
lt
was
my
turn

that�s
all
l
was
in
the
path
of
the
tornado
l
just
didn�t
expect
the
storm
would
last
as
long
as
it
has
think
you�ll
ever
get
out
of
here
one
day

when
l
got
a
long

white
beard
and
two
or
three
marbles
rolling
around
upstairs
l
tell
you
where
l�d
go
zihuatanejo
lt�s
in
mexico
a
little
place
on
the
pacific
ocean
you
know
what
the
mexicans
say
about
the
pacific
they
say
it
has
no
memory
that�s
where
l
want
to
live
the
rest
of
my
life
a
warm
place
with
no
memory
open
up
a
little
hotel
right
on
the
beach
buy
some
worthless
old
boat
and
fix
it
up
new
take
my
guests
out
charter
fishing
zihuatanejo
ln
a
place
like
that

l
could
use
a
man
that
knows
how
to
get
things
l
don�t
think
l
could
make
it
on
the
outside
l
been
in
here
most
of
my
life
l�m
an
institutional
man
now
just
like
brooks
was
you
underestimate
yourself
ln
here
l�m
the
guy
who
can
get
things
for
you

sure

but
outside
all
you
need
is
the
yellow
pages
hell

l
wouldn�t
know
where
to
begin
pacific
ocean
scare
me
to
death

something
that
big
not
me
l
didn�t
shoot
my
wife

and
l
didn�t
shoot
her
lover
whatever
mistakes
l
made

l�ve
paid
for
them
and
then
some
that
hotel

that
boat
l
don�t
think
that�s
too
much
to
ask
you
shouldn�t
be
doing
this
to
yourself
this
is
just
shitty
pipe
dreams
mexico
is
way
down
there
and
you�re
in
here
and
that�s
the
way
it
is
yeah

right

that�s
the
way
it
is
lt�s
down
there
and
l�m
in
here
l
guess
it
comes
down
to
a
simple
choice
get
busy
living
or
get
busy
dying
lf
you
ever
get
out
of
here

do
me
a
favor
sure

nothing

some
damn
rocks

windowsill
and
that
cupcake
on
the
wall

let�s
ask
her
maybe
she
knows
what
say
there

fuzzybritches
feel
like
talking
why
should
she
be
any
different
this
is
a
conspiracy
that�s
what
this
is
one
big

damn
conspiracy
and
everyone�s
in
on
it
lncluding
her
in
andy
dufresne
escaped
from
shawshank
prison
all
they
found
was
a
muddy
set
ofprison
clothes
a
bar
of
soap
and
an
old
rock
hammer
damn
near
worn
down
to
the
nub
i
had
thought
it�d
take
a
man

years
to
tunnel
through
the
wall
with
it
old
andy
did
it
in
less
than
oh

andy
loved
geology
i
imagine
it
appealed
to
his
meticulous
nature
an
ice
age
here
million
years
of
mountain
building
there
geology
is
the
study
ofpressure
and
time
that�s
all
it
takes

really
pressure
and
time
that
and
a
big
goddamn
poster
like
i
said
seems
andy�s
favorite
hobby
was
toting
his
wall
out
into
the
exercise
yard
a
handful
at
a
time
i
guess
after
tommy
was
killed
andy
decided
he�d
been
here
long
enough
licketysplit

l
want
to
get
home
three
deposits
tonight
andy
did
like
he
was
told
buffed
those
shoes
to
a
high
mirrorshine
the
guards
simply
didn�t
notice
i
mean

seriously
how
often
do
you
really
look
at
a
man�s
shoes
andy
crawled
to
freedom
through

yards
of
shitsmelling
foulness
i
can�t
even
imagine
or
maybe
ijust
don�t
want
to
five
hundred
yards
that�s
the
length
of
five
football
fields
just
shy
of
half
a
mile
the
next
morning

right
about
the
time
raquel
was
spilling
her
secret
a
man
nobody
ever
laid
eyes
on
before
strolled
into
the
maine
national
bank
until
that
moment

he
didn�t
exist
except
on
paper

may
l
help
you
he
had
all
the
proper
id
driver�s
license

birth
certificate

social
security
card
and
the
signature
was
a
spoton
match
l
must
say
l�m
sorry
to
be
losing
your
business
l
hope
you�ll
enjoy
living
abroad
l�m
sure
l
will
here�s
your
cashier�s
check

sir

will
there
be
anything
else
would
you
add
this
to
your
outgoing
mail
good
day

sir
mr

stevens
visited
nearly
a
dozen
banks
in
the
portland
area
that
morning
with
better
than

of
warden
norton�s
money
severance
pay
for

years
good
morning

portland
daily
bugle
byron
hadley
you
have
the
right
to
remain
silent
lf
you
give
up
this
right

anything
you
say
can
be
held
against
you
in
court
i
wasn�t
there
to
see

but
i
hear
byron
hadley
sobbed
like
a
girl
when
they
took
him
away
norton
had
no
intention
of
going
that
quietly
samuel
norton
we
have
a
warrant
for
your
arrest

open
up
l�m
not
sure
which
key
make
it
easy
on
yourself

norton
i
like
to
think
the
last
thing
that
went
through
his
head
other
than
that
bullet
was
to
wonder
how
the
hell
andy
dufresne
ever
got
the
best
of
him
not
long
after
the
warden
deprived
us
of
his
company
i
got
a
postcard
in
the
mail
it
was
blank

but
the
postmark
said
fort
hancock

texas
fort
hancock
right
on
the
border
that�s
where
andy
crossed
when
i
picture
him
heading
south
in
his
own
car
with
the
top
down
it
always
makes
me
laugh
who
crawled
through
a
river
of
shit
and
came
out
clean
on
the
other
side
headed
for
the
pacific
hadley�s
got
him
by
the
throat

right
he
says

l
believe
this
boy�s
about
to
have
himself
an
accident
those
of
us
who
knew
him
best
talk
about
him
often
my
friends
could
use
a
couple
of
beers
and
he
got
it
sometimes
it
makes
me
sad

though
andy
being
gone
i
have
to
remind
myself
that
some
birds
aren�t
meant
to
be
caged
their
feathers
arejust
too
bright
and
when
they
fly
away
the
part
of
you
that
knows
it
was
a
sin
to
lock
them
up
does
rejoice
but
still
the
place
you
live
in
is
that
much
more
drab
and
empty
that
they�re
gone
i
guess
ijust
miss
my
friend
ellis
boyd
redding
your
files
say
you�ve
served

years
of
a
life
sentence
you
feel
you�ve
been
rehabilitated
rehabilitated
well

now

let
me
see
l
don�t
have
any
idea
what
that
means
lt
means
you�re
ready
to
rejoin
society
l
know
what
you
think
it
means

sonny
to
me
it�s
just
a
madeup
word
a
politician�s
word
so
that
young
fellas
like
yourself
can
wear
a
suit
and
a
tie
and
have
a
job
what
do
you
really
want
to
know
am
l
sorry
for
what
l
did
well

are
you
there�s
not
a
day
goes
by
l
don�t
feel
regret
not
because
l�m
in
here
or
because
you
think
l
should
l
look
back
on
the
way
l
was
then
stupid
kid
who
committed
that
terrible
crime
l
want
to
talk
to
him
l
want
to
try
and
talk
some
sense
to
him
tell
him
the
way
things
are
but
l
can�t
that
kid�s
long
gone
and
this
old
man
is
all
that�s
left
l
got
to
live
with
that
lt�s
just
a
bullshit
word
so
you
go
on
and
stamp
your
forms

sonny

and
stop
wasting
my
time
because
to
tell
you
the
truth
l
don�t
give
a
shit
here
you

time

a
piss

just
go
forty
years
i�ve
been
asking
permission
to
piss
i
can�t
squeeze
a
drop
without
sayso
there�s
a
harsh
truth
to
face
no
way
i�m
going
to
make
it
on
the
outside
all
i
do
anymore
is
think
of
ways
to
break
my
parole
so
maybe
they�d
send
me
back
terrible
thing

to
live
in
fear
brooks
hatlen
knew
it
knew
it
all
too
well
all
i
want
is
to
be
back
where
things
make
sense
where
i
won�t
have
to
be
afraid
all
the
time
only
one
thing
stops
me
a
promise
i
made
to
andy
much
obliged

sir
dear
red
dear
red
and
if
you�ve
come
this
far

maybe
you�d
come
a
bit
further

the
town

you
i
could
use
a
good
man
to
help
me
get
my
project
on
wheels
i�ll
keep
an
eye
out
for
you

and
the
chessboard
ready
remember

red
hope

a
good
thing
maybe
the
best
of
things
and
no
good
thing

dies

will
be
hoping
that
this
letter
finds
you
and
finds
you
well
your
friend
that�s
goddamn
right
for
the
second
time
in
my
life
i�m
guilty
of
committing
a
crime
parole
violation
of
course
i
doubt
they�ll
toss
up
any
roadblocks
for
that
not
for
an
old
crook
like
me
fort
hancock

texas

please
i
find
i�m
so
excited
i
can
barely
sit
still

a
thought

my
head

think

the
excitement
only
a
free
man
can
feel
a
free
man
at
the
start
of
a
longjourney
whose
conclusion
is
uncertain
i
hope
i
can
make
it
across
the
border
i
hope
to
see
my
friend
and
shake
his
hand
i
hope
the
pacific
is
as
blue
as
it
has
been
in
my
dreams

confiscated
large
quantities
of
marijuana

shakedown

access
to
the
drugs
at
many
rest
and
relaxation
spots
in
bangkok

saigon

and
other
areas
throughout

thailand
officials
say
the
easy
availability
of
relatively
cheap
cost
of
high
purity
heroin
throughout
saigon
and
the
far
east
is
leading
to
an
epidemic

think
of
monopolies
you
mean

like
the
game
no

i
just
think
cause
no
one
wants
to
compete
nobody
wants
to
compete

not
with
a
monopoly
let
the
dairy
farmers
do
that
half
of
themd

out
of
business
tomorrow
i�m
just
trying
to
make
a
living

its
your
right
everybodys
right

its
america
we
just
cant
do
it
at
the
unreasonable
expense
of
others
cause
it
becomes
unamerican
thats
why
the
price
we
pay
for
that
gallon
of
milk
never
represents
the
true
cost
of
production
cause
its
gotta
be
controlled

its
gotta
be
set
its
gotta
be
fair
controlled
by
who
i
set
a
price
i
think
is
fair
i
dont
think
it
is

you
dont
i
dont
i
know
your
customers
are
happy

frank
bunch
of
fuckin
junkies
that
they
are
what
about
your
fellow
dairy
farmers
are
you
thinking
of
us
you
thinking
of
them
the
dairy
farmers
im
thinking
of
them

dominic

about
as
much
as
theyve
thought
about
me
im
just
thinking
out
loud
if
you
took
some
of
your
inventory
and
you
sold
it
wholesale
sit

we
could
work
you
could
use
some
distribution
i
dunno

im
pretty
good

i
got
th
to
th
river
to
river

im
all
right
its
kind
of
a
mom
and
pop
store
next
to
what
i�m
talking
about
and
thats
bigger
than
kmart
im
talking
about
la


chicago

detroit

las
vegas
lets
go
nationwide
im
gonna
guarantee
you
peace
of
mind
here
you
dont
want
that
you
gonna
need
it
i
dont
know
how
you
feel
me
im
kind
of
a
renaissance
man
the
people
i
deal
with
on
a
daily
basis
theyre
not
enlightened
you
talk
to
them
about
civil
rights

they
dont
know
theyre
not
open
to
change
not
from
the
way
things
are
done

and
whos
doing
it
i
can
talk
to
them

so
theres
no
misunderstanding
thats
what
i
mean
by
peace
of
mind
youre
paying
what




thousand
a
kilo
captain

yes

sir
tell
them
we
wish
to
board
at
once
with
all
due
respect
the
ambassadors
for
the
supreme
chancellor
wish
to
board
immediately
as
you
know

our
blockade
is
perfectly
legal
and
wed
be
happy
to
receive
the
ambassadors
im
tc

at
your
service
this
way

please
we
are
greatly
honoured
by
your
visit

ambassadors
make
yourselves
comfortable
my
master
will
be
with
you
shortly
i
dont
sense
anything

its
not
about
the
mission

master
its
something
elsewhere

elusive
dont
centre
on
your
anxieties

obiwan
keep
your
concentration
here
and
now

where
it
belongs
but
master
yoda
said
i
should
be
mindful
of
the
future
but
not
at
the
expense
of
the
moment
be
mindful
of
the
living
force

young
padawan
yes

master
how
do
you
think
this
trade
viceroy
will
deal
with
the
chancellors
demands
these
federation
types
are
cowards
the
negotiations
will
be
short
what
what
did
you
say
the
ambassadors
are
jedi
knights

i
believe
theyre
here
to
force
a
settlement
distract
them

i
will
contact
lord
sidious
are
you
braindead
im
not
going
in
there
with
two
jedi
send
a
droid
is
it
in
their
nature
to
make
us
wait
this
long
no

i
sense
an
unusual
amount
offear
for
something
as
trivial
as
this
trade
dispute
this
scheme
of
yours
has
failed

lord
sidious
the
blockade
is
finished

we
dare
not
go
against
these
jedi
viceroy

i
dont
want
this
stunted
slime
in
my
sight
again
this
turn
of
events
is
unfortunate

we
must
accelerate
our
plans
begin
landing
your
troops
my
lord

is
that
legal
i
will
make
it
legal
and
the
jedi
the
chancellor
should
never
have
brought
them
into
this
kill
them
immediately
yes

my
lord

as
you
wish
captain

look
shields
dioxis
they
must
be
dead

whats
left
of
them
oh

well
cover
you

roger

roger
uhoh

blast

you
ever
encountered
a
jedi
knight
before

sir
well

no

but
i
dont
seal
off
the
bridge
yes

sir

that
wont
be
enough

sir
i
want
droidekas
up
here
at
once
we
will
not
survive
this
close
the
blast
doors
that
will
hold
them
they
are
still
coming
through
where
are
those
droidekas
master
destroyers
they
have
shield
generators
its
a
standoff

lets
go
theyre
no
match
for
droidekas
theyve
gone
up
the
ventilation
shaft
battle
droids

its
an
invasion
army
this
is
an
odd
play
for
the
trade
federation
weve
got
to
warn
the
naboo
and
contact
chancellor
valorum
lets
split
up
stow
aboard
separate
ships
and
meet
down
on
the
planet
you
were
right
about
one
thing

master
the
negotiations
were
short
sir

a
transmission
from
the
planet
its
queen
amidala
herself
at
last
we
are
getting
results
again
you
come
before
us

your
highness
you
will
not
be
so
pleased
when
you
hear
what
i
have
to
say

viceroy
your
trade
boycott
of
our
planet
has
ended
i
was
not
aware
of
such
failure
i
have
word
that
the
chancellors
ambassadors
are
with
you
now
and
that
you
have
been
commanded
to
reach
settlement
i
know
nothing
of
any
ambassadors
you
must
be
mistaken
beware

viceroy
the
federation
has
gone
too
far
this
time
we
would
never
do
anything
without
the
approval
of
the
senate
you
assume
too
much
shes
right

the
senate
will
never
its
too
late
now
do
you
think
she
suspects
an
attack
i
dont
know
but
we
must
move
quickly
to
disrupt
all
communications
down
there
negotiations
havent
started
because
the
ambassadors
arent
there
how
could
that
be
true
i
have
assurances
from
the
chancellor
his
ambassadors
did
arrive
it
must
handiwork
negotiate
ambassadors
nobody
would
senator
palpatine
check
the
transmission
generator
a
communications
disruption
can
mean
only
one
thing
invasion
the
federation
would
not
dare
go
that
far
the
senate
would
revoke
their
trade
franchise

and
theyd
be
finished
we
must
continue
to
rely
on
negotiation
negotiation
weve
lost
all
communications
and
where
are
the
chancellors
ambassadors
this
is
a
dangerous
situation

your
highness
our
security
volunteers
will
be
no
match
against
a
battlehardened
federation
army
i
will
not
condone
a
course
of
action
that
will
lead
us
to
war
yes

viceroy
captain

weve
searched
the
ship
and
there
is
no
trace
of
the
jedi
they
may
have
gotten
on
one
of
your
landing
craft
if
theyre
down
here

theyve
knocked
out
all
our
communications

afford
to
kill
her
there
is
something
else

logic
in
the
federations

only
hope

choice
presents
great
danger
to
us

controlled
by
the
federation
except
that
the
hutts
arent
looking
for

gives
us
the
advantage

their
wishes
you

contact

its
a
trick

send
no
reply
send
no
transmissions
of
any
kind
it
sounds
like
bait
to
establish
a
connection
trace
what
if
it
is
true

and
the
people
are
dying
either
way

were
running
out
of
time
tatooine
is
sparsely
populated
if
the
trace
was
correct

i
will
find
them
quickly

master
move
against
the
jedi
first
you
will
then
have
no
difficulty
in
taking
the
queen
to
naboo
to
sign
the
treaty
at
last
we
will
reveal
ourselves
to
the
jedi
at
last
we
will
have
revenge
you
have
been
welltrained

my
young
apprentice
they
will
be
no
match
for
you
all
slaves
have
a
transmitter
placed
inside
their
bodies
somewhere
ive
been
working
on
a
scanner
to
try
and
locate
mine
any
attempt
to
escape
and
they
blow
you
up
how
wude
i
cant
believe
theres
still
slavery
in
the
galaxy
the
republics
antislavery
laws
the
republic
doesnt
exist
out
here
we
must
survive
on
our
own
has
anybody
ever
seen
a
podrace
they
have
podracing
on
malastare
very
fast

very
dangerous
im
the
only
human
who
can
do
it
you
must
have
jedi
reflexes
if
you
race
pods
dont
do
that
again
youre
a
jedi
knight

arent
you
what
makes
you
think
that
i
saw
your
light
saber
only
jedis
carry
that
kind
of
weapon
perhaps
i
killed
a
jedi
and
took
it
from
him
i
dont
think
so
no
one
can
kill
a
jedi
i
wish
that
were
so
i
had
a
dream
i
was
a
jedi
i
came
back
here
and
freed
all
the
slaves
have
you
come
to
free
us
no

im
afraid
not
i
think
you
have

why
else
would
you
be
here
i
can
see
theres
no
fooling
you

anakin
were
on
our
way
to
coruscant

the
central
system
in
the
republic
on
a
very
important
mission
how
did
you
end
up
out
here
in
the
outer
rim
our
ship
was
damaged

and
were
stranded
here
until
we
can
repair
it
i
can
help

i
can
fix
anything
i
believe
you
can
but
first
we
must
acquire
the
parts
we
need
wit
nonutten
mula
to
trade
these
junk
dealers
must
have
a
weakness
of
some
kind
gambling

everything
here
revolves
around
betting
on
those
awful
races
podracing
greed
can
be
a
powerful
ally
i
built
a
racer

its
the
fastest
ever
theres
a
big
race
tomorrow
on
boonta
eve
you
could
enter
my
pod
anakin

watto
wont
let
you

watto
doesnt
know
ive
built
it
you
could
make
him
think
it
was
yours
and
get
him
to
let
me
pilot
it
for
you
i
dont
want
you
to
race

its
awful
i
die
every
time
watto
makes
you
do
it
but

mom

i
love
it
the
prize
money
would
more
than
pay
for
the
parts
they
need
anakin
your
mothers
right
is
there
anyone
friendly
to
the
republic
who
can
help
us
mom

you
say
the
biggest
problem
in
this
universe
is
nobody
helps
each
other
im
sure
quigon
doesnt
want
to
put
your
son
in
danger
well
find
some
other
way
there
is
no
other
way
i
may
not
like
it

but
he
can
help
you
he
was
meant
to
help
you
are
you
sure
about
this
trusting
our
fate
to
a
boy
we
hardly
know
the
queen
will
not
approve
the
queen
doesnt
need
to
know
well

i
dont
approve
the
boy
tells
me
you
want
to
sponsor
him
in
the
race
how
can
you
do
this
not
on
the
republic
credits

i
think
my
ship
will
be
the
entry
fee
not
bad

huh
nubian

huh
its
in
good
order

except
for
the
parts
i
need
what
would
the
boy
ride
he
smashed
up
my
pod
in
the
last
race

it
would
take
some
long
time
to
fix
it
it
wasnt
my
fault

really
sebulba
flashed
me
with
his
vents
i
actually
saved
the
pod

mostly
that
you
did
the
boys
good

no
doubts
there

huh
i
have
acquired
a
pod
in
a
game
of
chance
the
fastest
ever
built
i
hope
you
didnt
kill
anyone
i
know
for
it

huh
so

you
supply
the
pod
and
the
entry
fee
and
i
supply
the
boy
we
split
the
winnings


i
think

huh
if
its
going
to
be
i
suggest
you
front
the
cash
for
the
entry
if
we
win
you
keep
all
the
winnings

minus
the
cost
of
the
parts
i
need
and
if
we
lose

you
keep
my
ship
either
way

you
win
your
friend
is
a
foolish
one

methinks
what
if
this
plan
fails

master
we
could
be
stuck
here
a
very
long
time
well

its
too
dangerous
to
call
for
help
and
a
ship
without
a
power
supply
isnt
going
to
get
us
anywhere
theres
something
about
this
boy
you
should
be
very
proud
of
your
son
he
gives
without
any
thought
of
reward
he
knows
nothing
of
greed
he
has
special
powers
he
can
see
things
before
they
happen
thats
why
he
appears
to
have
such
quick
reflexes
its
a
jedi
trait
he
deserves
better
than
a
slaves
life
had
he
been
born
in
the
republic

we
would
have
identified
him
early
the
force
is
unusually
strong
with
him

that
much
is
clear
who
was
his
father
there
was
no
father
i
carried
him

i
gave
birth

i
raised
him
i
cant
explain
what
happened
can
you
help
him
i
didnt
actually
come
here
to
free
slaves
wow

a
real
astro
droid
how
do
you
get
so
lucky
that
isnt
the
half
of
it
im
in
the
boonta

a
joker

ani
youve
been
working
on
that
foryears

be
a
little
odd
you
dont
even

i
think

this
power
charge

yes

on

kitster

lets
move
away
my
mouth
ani

im
stuck
youre
quite
right

hes
very
odd
indeed
its
working
its
working
stay
still

ani

let
me
clean
this
cut
theres
so
many

do
they
all
have
a
system
of
planets
most
of
them
has
anyone
been
to
em
all
not
likely
i
wanna
be
the
first
one
to

em
all
ani

not

a
midichlorian
count
the
reading
is
off
the
chart
over
even
master
yoda
doesn
t
have
a
midichlorian
count
that
high
no
jedi
has
what
does
that
mean
im
not
sure
i
wanna
see
your
spaceship
the
moment
the
race
is
over
patience

my
blue
friend
youll
have
your
winnings
before
the
suns
set
and
well
be
far
away
from

not
if
your
ship
belongs
to
me

i
think

i
warn
you

no
funny
business
you
dont
think
anakin
can
win
dont
get
me
wrong
i
have
great
faith
in
the
boy
hes
a
credit
to
your
race
but
sebulba
there
is
going
to
win

i
think
why
do
you
think
that
he
always
wins
i
am
betting
heavily
on
sebulba
ill
take
that
bet

what
ill
wager
my
new
racing
pod
against

say
the
boy
and
his
mother
no
pod
is
worth
two
slaves

not
by
a
long
shot
the
boy

then
well
let
fate
decide

huh
i
just
happen
to
have
a
chance
cube
here
blue

its
the
boy
red
you
won
this
small
toss

outlander
but
you
wont
win
the
race
so
it
makes
little
difference
better
stop
your
friends
betting
or
ill
end
up
owning
him
too
whatd
he
mean
by
that
ill
tell
you
later
oh

my

space

rather
perilous
i
can
assure
you

they
will
never
get
me
onto

dreadful
starships
this
is
so
wizard

ani

im

over
there

fly
low
are
you
all
right
i
think
so
but
it
was
welltrained
in
the
jedi
arts
my
guess
is
it
was
after
the
queen
what
are
we
gonna
do
about
it
we
shall
be
patient
anakin
skywalker
meet
obiwan
kenobi
youre
a
jedi
too
pleased
to
meet
you
your
queen
is
lost

your
people
are
starving
and
you

governor

are
going
to
die
much
sooner
than
your
people

im
afraid
this
invasion
will
gain
you
nothing
were
a
democracy

the
people
have
decided
my
troops
are
in
position
to
begin
searching
the
swamps
for
these
rumoured
underwater
villages
they
will
not
stay
hidden
for
long
the
death
toll
is
catastrophic
we
must
bow
to
their
wishes
you
must
contact
me
you
come
from
a
warm
planet

ani
a
little
too
warm
for
my
taste
space
is
cold
you
seem
sad
the
queen
is
worried
her
people
are
suffering

dying
she
must
convince
the
senate
to
intervene
or
im
not
sure
whatll
happen
i
made
this
for
you
so
youd
remember
me
i
carved
it
out
of
a
japor
snippet
itll
bring
you
good
fortune
but
i
dont
need
this
to
remember
you
by
many
things
will
change
when
we
reach
the
capital

ani
but
my
caring
for
you
will
remain
i
care
for
you

too

only
i
miss
your
mother
theres
chancellor
valorums
shuttle
and
look
over
there

senator
palpatine
is
waiting
for
us
it
is
a
great
gift
to
see
you
alive

your
majesty
with
the
communications
breakdown

weve
been
very
concerned
im
anxious
to
hear
your
report
on
the
situation
may
i
present
supreme
chancellor
valorum
welcome

your
highness
its
an
honour
to
finally
meet
you
in
person
thank
you

supreme
chancellor
i
must
relay
to
you
how
distressed
everyone
is
over
the
current
situation
ive
called
for
a
special
session
of
the
senate
to
hear
your
position
im
grateful
for
your
concern

chancellor
there
is
a
question
of
procedure
but
im
confident
we
can
overcome
it
i
must
speak
with
the
jedi
council
immediately
the
situation
has
become
much
more
complicated
ani

come
on
da
queens
a
bein
grossly
nice

mesa
tinks
pitty
hot
there
is
no
civility

only
politics
the
republic
is
not
what
it
once
was
the
senate
is
full
of
greedy

squabbling
delegates
there
is
no
interest
in
the
common
good
i
must
be
frank

your
majesty
there
is
little
chance
the
senate
will
act
on
the
invasion
chancellor
valorum
seems
to
think
there
is
hope
if
i
may
say
so

your
majesty
the
chancellor
has
little
real
power
he
is
mired
by
baseless
accusations
ofcorruption
the
bureaucrats
are
in
charge
now

what
options
have
we
our
best
choice
would
be
to
push
for
the
election
of
a
stronger
supreme
chancellor
one
who
could
control
the
bureaucrats
and
give
us
justice
you
could
call
for
a
vote
of
no
confidence
in
chancellor
valorum
he
has
been
our
strongest
supporter
our
only
other
choice
would
be
to
submit
a
plea
to
the
courts
the
courts
take
even
longer
to
decide
things
than
the
senate
our
people
are
dying

senator
we
must
do
something
quickly
to
stop
the
federation
to
be
realistic

your
majesty
i
think
were
going
to
have
to
accept
federation
control
for
the
time
being
that
is
something
i
cannot
do
he
was
trained
in
the
jedi
arts
my
only
conclusion
can
be
that
it
was
a
sith
lord
the
sith
have
been
extinct
for
a
millennium
i
do
not
believe
the
sith
could
have
returned
without
us
knowing
hard
to
see

the
dark
side
is
we
will
use
all
our
resources
to
unravel
this
mystery
we
will
discover
the
identity
of
your
attacker
may
the
force
be
with
you
master
quigon
more
to
say
have
you
with
your
permission

my
master
i
have
encountered
a
vergence
in
the
force
a
vergence

you
say
located
around
a
person
a
boy
his
cells
have
the
highest
concentration
of
midichlorians
i
have
seen
in
a
lifeform
it
is
possible
he
was
conceived
by
the
midichlorians
you
refer
to
the
prophecy
of
the
one
who
will
bring
balance
to
the
force
you
believe
its
this
boy
i
dont
presume
to
but
you
do
revealed
your
opinion
is
i
request
the
boy
be
tested

master
trained
as
a
jedi
you
request
for
him

hmm
finding
him
was
the
will
of
the
force
i
have
no
doubt
of
that
bring
him
before
us

then
the
boys
here
to
see
padm�
im
sorry

ani

but
padm�s
not
here
right
now
anakin
skywalker
to
see
padm�

your
highness
ive
sent
padm�
on
an
errand
im
on
my
way
to
the
jedi
temple
to
start
my
training

i
hope
i
may
never
see
her
again

so
i
came
to
say
goodbye
we
will
tell
her
for
you

we
are
sure
her
heart
goes
with
you
thank
you

your
highness
the
chair
recognizes
the
senator
from
the
sovereign
system
of
naboo
supreme
chancellor

delegates
of
the
senate
a
tragedy
has
occurred
which
started
right
here
with
the
taxation
of
trade
routes
and
has
now
engulfed
our
entire
planet
in
the
oppression
of
the
trade
federation
this
is
outrageous
i
object
to
the
senators
statements
the
chair
does
not
recognize
the
senator
from
the
trade
federation
at
this
time
to
state
our
allegations

i
present
queen
amidala
recently
elected
ruler
of
the
naboo
who
speaks
on
our
behalf
honourable
representatives
of
the
republic
i
come
to
you
under
the
gravest
of
circumstances
the
naboo
system
has
been
invaded
by
the
droid
armies
of
the
trade
i
object
there
is
no
proof
this
is
incredible
we
recommend
a
commission
be
sent
to
naboo
to
ascertain
the
truth
the
congress
of
malastare
concurs
with
the
honourable
delegate
from
the
trade
federation
a
commission
must
be
appointed
the
point
excuse
me

chancellor
enter
the
bureaucrat
the
true
rulers
of
the
republic
and
on
the
payroll
of
the
trade
federation

i
might
add
this
is
where
chancellor
valorums
strength
will
disappear
the
point
is
conceded
will
you
defer
your
motion
to
allow
a
commission
to
explore
the
validity
of
your
accusations
i
will
not
defer
ive
come
before
you
to
resolve
this
attack
on
our
sovereignty
now
i
was
not
elected
to
watch
my
people
suffer
and
die
while
you
discuss
this
invasion
in
a
committee
if
this
body
is
not
capable
of
action
i
suggest
new
leadership
is
needed
i
move
for
a
vote
of
no
confidence
in
chancellor
valorums
leadership
vote
now
vote
now
order
now
they
will
elect
a
new
chancellor
a
strong
chancellor
one
who
will
not
let
our
tragedy
continue
the
boy
will
not
pass
the
councils
test

master

hes
too
old
anakin
will
become
a
jedi

i
promise
you
do
not
defy
the
council

master

not
again
i
shall
do
what
i
must

obiwan
if
you
would
just
follow
the
code

you
would
be
on
the
council
they
will
not
go
along
with
you
this
time
you
still
have
much
to
learn

my
young
apprentice
a
ship
a
cup
a
speeder
how
feel
you
cold

sir
afraid
are
you
no

sir
see
through
you
we
can
be
mindful
of
your
feelings
your
thoughts
dwell
on
your
mother
i
miss
her
afraid
to
lose
her

i
think

mmm
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
anything
fear
is
the
path
to
the
dark
side
fear
leads
to
anger

anger
leads
to
hate
hate
leads
to
suffering
i
sense
much
fear
in
you
yousa
tinking
yousa
people
ganna
die
gungans
get
pasted
too

eh
i
hope
not
gungans
no
dien
without
a
fight
wesa
warriors

got
a
grand
army
dats
why
you
no
liken
us

mesa
tinks

palpatine
has
been
nominated
to
succeed

as
supreme
chancellor

surprise

to
be
sure

but
a
welcome
one
your
majesty

if
i
am
elected

i
promise
to
put
an
end
to
corruption
who
else
has
been
nominated
bail
antilles
of
alderaan
and
ainlee
teem
of
malastare
i
feel
confident
our
situation
will
create
a
strong
sympathy
vote
for
us
i
will
be
chancellor
i
fear
by
the
time
you
have
control
of
the
bureaucrats

senator
therell
be
nothing
left
ofour
people

our
way
of
life
i
understand
your
concern

your
majesty
unfortunately

the
federation
has
possession
of
our
planet
senator

this
is
your
arena
i
feel
i
must
return
to
mine
ive
decided
to
go
back
to
naboo
but

your
majesty

be
realistic

theyll
force
you
to
sign
the
treaty
i
will
sign
no
treaty

senator
my
fate
will
be
no
different
than
that
of
our
people
captain

your
highness
ready
my
ship

please

your
majesty
stay
here
where
its
safe
it
is
clear
to
me
now
that
the
republic
no
longer
functions
i
pray
you
will
bring
sanity
and
compassion
back
to
the
senate
the
force
is
strong
with
him
he
is
to
be
trained

then
no

he
will
not
be
trained
he
is
too
old
he
is
the
chosen
one

you
must
see
it
clouded
this
boys
future
is
i
will
train
him

then
i
take
anakin
as
my
padawan
learner
an
apprentice
you
have

quigon
impossible
to
take
on
a
second
the
code
forbids
it
obiwan
is
ready

i
am
ready
to
face
the
trials
our
own
counsel
we
will
keep
on
who
is
ready
he
is
headstrong
and
he
has
much
to
learn
of
the
living
force
but
he
is
capable
there
is
little
more
he
can
learn
from
me
young
skywalkers
fate
will
be
decided
later
now
is
not
the
time
for
this
the
senate
is
voting
for
a
new
supreme
chancellor
and
queen
amidala
is
returning
home
which
puts
pressure
on
the
federation
and
could
widen
the
confrontation
and
draw
out
the
queens
attacker
go
with
the
queen
to
naboo
and
discover
the
identity
of
this
dark
warrior
this
is
the
clue
we
need
to
unravel
the
mystery
of
the
sith
its
not
disrespect

master

its
the
truth
from
your
point
ofview
the
boy
is
dangerous

they
all
sense
it

why
cant
you
his
fate
is
uncertain

hes
not
dangerous
the
council
will
decide
anakins
future
that
should
be
enough
for
you

now
get
on
board
quigon

i
dont
want

be
a
problem

i

yoda
talking
about
midichlorians
ive
been
wondering

midichlorians
midichlorians
are
a
microscopic
lifeform
that
resides
within
all
living
cells
they
live
inside
me
inside
your
cells

yes
and
we
are
symbionts
with
them

symbionts
lifeforms
living
together
for
mutual
advantage
without
the
midichlorians

life
could
not
exist
and
we
would
have
no
knowledge
of
the
force
they
continually
speak
to
us
telling
us
the
will
of
the
force
when
you
learn
to
quiet
your
mind
youll
hear
them
speaking
to
you
with
time
and
training

ani

you
will

you
will
your
majesty

it
is
our
pleasure
to
continue
to
serve
and
protect
you
i
welcome
your
help
senator
palpatine
fears
that
the
federation
means
to
destroy
me
i
assure
you
i
will
not
allow
that
to
happen
wesa
goin
home
come
on

r
is
the
planet
secure
we
have
taken
over
the
last
pockets
of
primitive
lifeforms
we
are
in
complete
control
of
the
planet
now
good

i
will
see
to
it
that
in
the
senate
things
stay
as
they
are
i
am
sending
my
apprentice

darth
maul

to
join
you
a
sith
here
those
are
the
forward
stabilizers
and
those
two
control
the
pitch
you
catch
on
pretty
quick
as
soon
as
we
land
the
federation
will
arrest
you
and
force
you
to
sign
the
treaty
i

you
wish
to
accomplish
by
this

act
quickly

all
will
be
lost
forever
i
ask
you
to
help
us
no

i
beg
you
to
help
us
we
are
your
humble
servants
our
fate
is
in
your
hands
yousa
no
tinken
yousa
greater
den
da
gungans
mesa
lika
dis
wesa
being
friends
weve
sent
our
patrols
we
already
located
their
starship
in
the
swamp
it
wont
be
long

my
lord
this
is
an
unexpected
move
for
her
its
too
aggressive
lord
maul

be
mindful
let
them
make
the
first
move
yes

my
master
good

they
made
it
yousa
doen
grand
jarjar
bring
ussen
and
da
naboo
together
so

wesa
make
you
bombad
general
your
highness

what
is
the
situation
almost
everyones
in
camps
a
few
hundred
police
and
guards
formed
an
underground
resistance
movement
i
brought
back
as
many
of
the
leaders
as
i
could
the
federation
armys
also
much
larger
than
we
thought
and
much
stronger
your
highness

this
is
a
battle
i
do
not
think
that
we
can
win
the
battle
is
a
diversion
the
gungans
must
draw
the
droid
army
away
from
the
cities
r
we
can
enter
the
city
using
the
secret
passages
on
the
waterfall
side
once
we
get
to
the
main
entrance
captain
panaka
will
create
a
diversion
then
we
can
enter
the
palace
and
capture
the
viceroy
without
the
viceroy

they
will
be
lost
and
confused
what
do
you
think

master
jedi
the
viceroy
will
be
wellguarded
the
difficulty
is
getting
into
the
throne
room
once
were
inside

we
shouldnt
have
a
problem
there
is
a
possibility

with
this
diversion

many
gungans
will
be
killed
wesa
ready
to
do
oursan
part
we
have
a
plan
which
should
immobilize
the
droid
army
we
will
send
what
pilots
we
have
to
knock
out
the
droid
control
ship
orbiting
the
planet
a
wellconceived
plan

however

theres
great
risk
the
weapons
on
your
fighters
may
not
penetrate
the
shields
theres
an
even
bigger
danger
if
the
viceroy
escapes

your
highness
he
will
return
with
another
droid
army
well

that
is
why
we
must
not
fail
to
get
the
viceroy
everything
depends
on
it
she
is
more
foolish
than
i
thought
we
are
sending
all
troops
to
meet
this
army
assembling
near
the
swamp
it
appears
to
be
made
up
of
primitives
this
will
work
to
our
advantage
i
have
your
approval
to
proceed

then

my
lord
wipe
them
out
all
of
them
starting
up
the
shield
open
fire
once
we
get
inside

you
find
a
safe
place
to
hide
and
stay
there
sure

stay
there
roger

roger
i
thought
the
battle
was
going
to
take
place
far
from
here
this
is
too
close
ani

find
cover
quick
get
to
your
ships
fighters
straight
ahead
roger

bravo
leader
cease
fire
steady

steady
activate
the
droids

lll
get
in
once
upon
a
time
in
lombardy
where
the
tuscan
tongue
is
spoken
there
was
a
convent
famous
for
its
chastity
let
me
tell
it
the
neapolitan
way
now

what
happened
in
the
convent
a
very
goodlooking
nun
fell
in
love
with
a
handsome
youth
she
let
him
into
her
cell
at
night
but
one
night

the
other
nuns

they
were
jealous
they
caught
them
right
in
the
act
they
went
to
mother
superior
they
knocked
on
her
door
she
was
in
bed
with
a
priest
she
was
so
scared
she
mistook
the
priests
drawers
for
her
veil
and
opened
the
door
with
them
on
her
head
she
went
to
knock
on
the
young
nuns
door
the
frightened
nun
came
out

then
said
so
you
too
were
having
fun
the
priests
drawers
are
on
your
head
after
that

all
the
nuns
had
a
good
time
work
should
feed
us

not
kill
us
do
you
know
the
convent
on
the
hill

used
to
work
there
you
cant
imagine
the
trouble
they
gave
me
lt

they
cant
hire
a
young
man
in
the
convent
l
wont
send
a
soul

young
or

no

can
stand
it
in
there
where
can
l
find
an
old
man

bad
humourless
poppycocks

in
my
limited
experience

your
eye

watch
your
tongue

good
of

of
the
painted
peacocks

mr
bingley

person

the
quizzical
brow
that

his
good
friend

mr
darcy

miserable

poor
soul

be

but
poor
he

he
owns
half
of
derbyshire

miserable
half
mr
bennet

him
to
the
girls
immediately
smile
at
mr
bingley

smile
mr
bingley

my
eldest
daughter
you
know
mrs
bennet

miss
jane
bennet

elizabeth
and
miss
mary
bennet

is
a
pleasure

i

two
others

but
theyre
already
dancing
im
delighted
to
make
your
acquaintance
and
may
i
introduce
mr
darcy
of
pemberley
in
derbyshire
how
do
you
like
it
here
in
hertfordshire
very
much
the
library
at
netherfield

ive
heard

is
one
of
the
finest
it
fills
me
with
guilt

im
not
a
good
reader

i
prefer
being
out
of
doors
oh

i
mean

i
can
read

of
course
and
im
not
suggesting
you
cant
read
out
of
doors
i
wish
i
read
more

but
there
seem
to
be
so
many
other
things
to
do
thats
exactly
what
i
meant
mama

mama
you
will
never

ever
believe
what
were
about
to
tell
you
tell
me
shes
going
to
take
the
veil
the
regiment
are
coming
officers
theyre
going
to
be
stationed
the
whole
winter

right
here
officers
as
far
as
the
eye
can
see
oh

look

janes
dancing
with
mr
bingley
do
you
dance

mr
darcy
not
if
i
can
help
it
i
didnt
know
you
were
coming
to
see
me

whats
the
matter
we
are
a
long
way
from
grosvenor
square

are
we
not

mr
darcy
ive
never
seen
so
many
pretty
girls
you
were
dancing
with
the
only
handsome
girl
she
is
the
most
beautiful
creature
i
have
ever
beheld
but
her
sister
elizabeth
is
agreeable

perfectly
tolerable
not
handsome
enough
to
tempt
me

return
to
your
partner
and
enjoy
her
smiles
youre
wasting
your
time
with
me
count
your
blessings

lizzie

if
he
liked
you

youd
have
to
talk
to
him
precisely
i
wouldnt
dance
with
him
for
all
of
derbyshire
let
alone
the
miserable
half
i
enjoyed
that
so
much

miss
lucas

how
well
you
dance

mr
bingley
ive
never
enjoyed
a
dance
so
much
my
daughter
jane
is
a
splendid
dancer

is
she
not
your
friend
miss
lucas
is
a
most
amusing
young
woman
oh

yes

i
adore
her
it
is
a
pity
shes
not
more
handsome

mama
oh

but
lizzie
would
never
admit
that
shes
plain
of
course

its
my
jane
whos
considered
the
beauty
of
the
county
mama

please
when
she
was


a
gentleman
was
so
much
in
love
with
her
i
was
sure
he
would
make
her
an
offer
however

he
did
write
her
some
very
pretty
verses
and
that
put
paid
to
it
i
wonder
who
discovered
the
power
of
poetry
in
driving
away
love
i
thought
poetry
was
the
food
of
love

of
a
fine

stout
love
but
if
it
is
only
a
vague
inclination

one
poor
sonnet
will
kill
it
so

what
do
you
recommend
to
encourage
affection
dancing

even
if
ones
partner
is
barely
tolerable
mr
bingley
is
just
what
a
young
man
ought
to
be
sensible

goodhumoured
handsome

conveniently
rich
marriage
should
not
be
driven
by
thoughts
of
money
only
deep
love
will
persuade
me
to
marry
which
is
why
ill
end
up
an
old
maid

do
you
really
believe
he
liked
me
he
danced
with
you
most
of
the
night

and
stared
at
you
the
rest
i
give
you
leave
to
like
him

youve
liked
many
stupider
youre
a
great
deal
too
apt
to
like
people
in
general
all
the
world
is
good
in
your
eyes
not
his
friend

i
still
cant
believe
what
he
said
about
you
mr
darcy
id
more
easily
forgive
his
vanity
had
he
not
wounded
mine
but
no
matter

i
doubt
we
shall
ever
speak
again
he
danced
with
miss
lucas
we
were
all
there

dear
it
is
a
shame
shes
not
more
handsome
theres
a
spinster
in
the
making
and
no
mistake
the
fourth
with
a
miss
king
of
little
standing
and
the
fifth
again
with
jane
if
he
had
any
compassion

he
wouldve
sprained
his
ankle
the
way
you
carry
on
youd
think
our
girls
look
forward
to
a
grand
inheritance
when
you
die

which
may
be
very
soon
they
will
be
left
without
a
roof
over
their
head
nor
a
penny
to
their
name
please

its
ten
in
the
morning

a
letter
to
miss
bennet

maam
from
netherfield
hall
praise
the
lord

we
are
saved
make
haste

jane

make
haste

oh

happy
day
it
is
from
caroline
bingley
she
has
invited
me
to
dine
with
her
her
brother
will
be
dining
out

dining
out
can
i
take
the
carriage
let
me
see
it
is
too
far
to
walk

this
is
unaccountable
of
him
mama

the
carriage
for
jane
certainly
not

shell
go
on
horseback
horseback
now
shell
have
to
stay
the
night

exactly
as
i
predicted
good
grief

woman

your
skills
in
the
art
of
matchmaking
are
positively
occult
though
i
dont
think

mama

you
can
take
credit
for
making
it
rain
my
friends
will
not
hear
of
me
returning
home
until
i
am
better
excepting
a
sore
throat

a
fever
and
a
headache

nothing
is
wrong
with
me
if
jane
does
die
it
will
be
a
comfort
to
know
it
was
in
pursuit
of
mr
bingley
people
do
not
die
of
colds
but
she
may
perish
with
the
shame
of
having
such
a
mother
i
must
go
to
netherfield
at
once
lady
bathurst
is
redecorating
her
ballroom
in
the
french
style
a
little
unpatriotic

dont
you
think
miss
elizabeth
bennet
good
lord

did
you
walk
here
im
so
sorry

how
is
my
sister
shes
upstairs
my
goodness

did
you
see
her
hem
six
inches
deep
in
mud
she
looked
positively
mediaeval
i
feel
such
a
terrible
imposition

theyre
being
so
kind
to
me
i
dont
know
who
is
more
pleased
at
your
being
here

mama
or
mr
bingley
thank
you
for
tending
to
my
sister
so
diligently
shes
in
far
better
comfort
than
at
home
its
a
pleasure
i
mean

its
not
a
pleasure
that
shes
ill

of
course
not
its
a
pleasure
that
shes
here

being
ill
not
going
to
be
famous

our
pig
black
on
the
back

but
not
related
to
the
learned
pig
of
norwich
now
that
pig
is
mr
bennet
its
all
going
to
plan

hes
half
in
love
with
her
already
who
is

blossom
mr
bingley
he
doesnt
mind
that
she
hasnt
a
penny
he
has
more
than
enough
for
the
two
of
them
how
will
we
meet
them
easy
wait
for
me
you
drop
something

they
pick
it
up

and
then
youre
introduced
officers
you
write
uncommonly
fast

mr
darcy
youre
mistaken

i
write
slowly
how
many
letters
you
must
have
occasion
to
write

mr
darcy
letters
of
business

how
odious
i
should
think
them
it
is
fortunate

then

they
fall
to
me
and
not
you
tell
your
sister
i
long
to
see
her
ive
already
told
her
once

i
do
dote
on
her
i
was
quite
in
raptures
at
her
beautiful
design
for
a
table
perhaps
you
will
give
me
leave
to
defer
your
raptures
i
have
not
room
enough
to
do
them
justice
you
young
ladies
are
so
accomplished
what
do
you
mean
you
paint
tables

play
the
piano
and
embroider
cushions
i
never
heard
of
a
lady

but
people
say
shes
accomplished
the
word
is
applied
too
liberally
i
do
not
know
more
than
half
a
dozen
women
that
are
truly
accomplished

nor
i
goodness

you
must
comprehend
a
great
deal
in
the
idea
she
must
have
a
knowledge
of
music

singing

drawing

dancing
and
the
modern
languages
to
deserve
the
word
and
something
in
her
air
and
manner
of
walking
and
she
must
improve
her
mind
by
extensive
reading
im
no
longer
surprised
at
your
knowing
only
six
accomplished
women
i
wonder
at
you
knowing
any

are
you
so
severe
on
your
own
sex
i
never
saw
such
a
woman

she
would
certainly
be
a
fearsome
thing
to
behold
miss
elizabeth

let
us
take
a
turn
about
the
room
its
refreshing

is
it
not

after
sitting
so
long
in
one
attitude
it
is
a
small
kind
of
accomplishment

i
suppose
will
you
not
join
us

mr
darcy
you
can
only
have
two
motives

and
i
would
interfere
with
either
the
surest
way
to
disappoint
him
would
be
to
ask
him
nothing
do
tell
us

mr
darcy
either
you
are
in
each
others
confidence
and
you
have
secret
affairs
to
discuss
or
you
are
conscious
that
your
figures
appear
to
the
greatest
advantage
by
walking
if
the
first

i
should
get
in
your
way
if
the
second

i
can
admire
you
much
better
from
here
how
shall
we
punish
him
for
such
a
speech
we
could
laugh
at
him

no

mr
darcy
is
not
to
be
teased
are
you
too
proud

mr
darcy
and
would
you
consider
pride
a
fault
or
a
virtue
i
couldnt
say

were
trying
to
find
a
fault
in
you
i
find
it
hard
to
forgive
the
follies
and
vices
of
others
or
their
offences
against
me
my
good
opinion

once
lost

is
lost
forever
oh

dear

i
cannot
tease
you
about
that
what
a
shame

for
i
dearly
love
to
laugh
a
family
trait

i
think
a
mrs
bennet

a
miss
bennet

a
miss
bennet
and
a
miss
bennet

sir
are
we
to
receive
every
bennet
in
the
country
what
an
excellent
room
you
have

sir
such
expensive
furnishings
i
do
hope
you
intend
to
stay
here

mr
bingley
absolutely

i
find
the
country
very
diverting

dont
you
agree

darcy
i
find
it
perfectly
adequate
even
if
society
is
a
little
less
varied
than
in
town
less
varied
not
at
all
we
dine
with
four
and

families
of
all
shapes
and
sizes
sir
william
lucas

for
instance

is
a
very
agreeable
man
and
a
good
deal
less
selfimportant
than
some
people
half
his
rank
mr
bingley

is
it
true
you
will
hold
a
ball
here
a
ball
it
would
be
an
excellent
way
to
meet
new
friends

you
could
invite
the
militia
oh

do
hold
a
ball
kitty
when
your
sister
recovers

you
shall
name
the
day
i
think
a
ball
is
an
irrational
way
to
gain
new
acquaintance
it
would
be
better
if
conversation

not
dancing

were
the
order
of
the
day
indeed

much
more
rational

but
rather
less
like
a
ball
thank
you

mary
what
a
fine
imposing
place
to
be
sure

is
it
not

my
dears
theres
no
house
to
equal
it
in
the
county
mr
darcy

miss
bennet
there
she
is

i
dont
know
how
to
thank
you
youre
welcome
any
time
you
feel
the
least
bit
poorly
thank
you
for
your
stimulating
company

most
instructive
not
at
all

the
pleasure
is
all
mine
mr
darcy

miss
elizabeth
and
then
there
was
one
with
great
long
lashes

like
a
cow
ask
mrs
hill
to
order
us
a
sirloin

betsy
just
the
one

mind

were
not
made
of
money
i
hope

my
dear

youve
ordered
a
good
dinner
today
ive
reason
to
expect
an
addition
to
our
family
party
his
names
mr
collins

the
dreaded
cousin
who
is
to
inherit
everything
even
my
piano
stool
belongs
to
mr
collins
he
may
turn
us
out
of
the
house
as
soon
as
he
pleases
the
estate
passes
directly
to
him
and
not
to
us
poor
females
mr
collins

at
your
service
what
a
superbly
featured
room
and
what
excellent
potatoes
its
many
years
since
ive
had
such
an
exemplary
vegetable
to
which
fair
cousin
should
i
compliment
the
excellence
of
the
cooking
we
are
perfectly
able
to
keep
a
cook
im
very
pleased
the
estate
can
afford
such
a
living
im
honoured
to
have
as
my
patroness
lady
catherine
de
bourgh
youve
heard
of
her

i
presume
my
small
rectory
abuts
her
estate
rosings
park

and
she
often
condescends
to
drive
by
my
humble
dwelling
in
her
little
phaeton
and
ponies
does
she
have
any
family
one
daughter

the
heiress
of
rosings
and
very
extensive
property
ive
often
observed
to
lady
catherine
that
her
daughter
seemed
born
to
be
a
duchess
for
she
has
all
the
superior
graces
of
elevated
rank
these
kind
of
compliments
are
always
acceptable
to
the
ladies
and
which
i
conceive
myself
particularly
bound
to
pay
how
happy
for
you

mr
collins
to
possess
the
talent
for
flattering
with
such
delicacy
do
these
attentions
proceed
from
the
impulse
of
the
moment
or
are
they
the
result
of
previous
study
they
arise
from
what
is
passing
at
the
time
and
though
i
do
sometimes
amuse
myself
with
arranging
such
little
compliments
i
always
wish
to
give
them
as
unstudied
an
air
as
possible
oh

believe
me

no
one
would
suspect
your
manners
to
be
rehearsed
after
dinner

i
thought
i
might
read
to
you
for
an
hour
or
two
i
have
with
me
fordyces
sermons
which
speak
very
eloquently
on
all
matters
moral
are
you
familiar
with
fordyces
sermons

miss
bennet
mrs
bennet

i
have
been
bestowed
by
the
good
grace
of
lady
catherine
de
bourgh
a
parsonage
of
no
mean
size
i
have
become
aware
of
the
fact
it
is
my
avowed
hope
that
soon
i
may
find
a
mistress
for
it
and
i
have
to
inform
you
that
the
eldest
miss
bennet
has
captured
my
special
attention
oh

mr
collins
unfortunately

it
is
incumbent
upon
me
to
hint
that
the
eldest
miss
bennet
is
very
soon
to
be
engaged
engaged
but
miss
lizzie

next
to
her
in
age
and
beauty
would
make
anyone
an
excellent
partner
do
not
you
agree
mr
collins
a
very
agreeable
alternative
mr
collins
is
a
man
who
makes
you
despair
at
the
entire
sex
yours

i
believe

oh

mr
wickham

how
perfect
you
are
he
picked
up
my
handkerchief

did
you
drop
yours
on
purpose
mr
wickham
is
a
lieutenant
an
enchanted
lieutenant

what
are
you
up
to

liddy
we
happened
to
be
looking
for
ribbon

white

for
the
ball
shall
we
all
look
for
some
ribbon
together
good
afternoon

mr
james

miss
lydia

miss
bennet
i
shant
even
browse
i
cant
be
trusted

i
have
poor
taste
in
ribbons
only
a
truly
confident
man
would
admit
that
no

its
true
and
buckles

when
it
comes
to
buckles

im
lost
you
must
be
the
shame
of
the
regiment

the
laughing
stock
what
do
your
superiors
do
with
you
ignore
me

im
of
next
to
no
importance

so
its
easily
done
lizzie

lend
me
some
money

you
already
owe
me
a
fortune
allow
me
to
oblige

no

mr
wickham

please
i
pity
the
french

so
do
i
look

mr
bingley

mr
bingley
i
was
just
on
my
way
to
your
house
how
do
you
like
my
ribbons
for
your
ball
very
beautiful

she
is

look

shes
blooming
oh

lydia
be
sure
to
invite
mr
wickham

he
is
a
credit
to
his
profession
you
cant
invite
people
to
other
peoples
balls
of
course

you
must
come

mr
wickham
if
youll
excuse
me

ladies

enjoy
the
day
do
you
plan
to
go
to
the
netherfield
ball

mr
wickham
perhaps

how
long
has
mr
darcy
been
a
guest
there
about
a
month
forgive
me

but
are
you
acquainted
with
him

with
mr
darcy
indeed

ive
been
connected
with
his
family
since
infancy
you
may
well
be
surprised

given
our
cold
greeting
this
afternoon
i
hope
your
plans
in
favour
of
meryton
will
not
be
affected
by
your
relations
with
the
gentleman

it
is
not
for
me
to
be
driven
away
if
he
wishes
to
avoid
seeing
me

he
must
go

not
i
i
must
ask

what
is
the
manner
of
your
disapproval
of
mr
darcy
my
father
managed
his
estate
we
grew
up
together

darcy
and
i
his
father
treated
me
like
a
second
son

loved
me
like
a
son
we
were
both
with
him
the
day
he
died
with
his
last
breath
his
father
bequeathed
me
the
rectory
in
his
estate
he
knew
i
had
my
heart
set
on
joining
the
church
but
darcy
ignored
his
wishes
and
gave
the
living
to
another
man
but
why
jealousy
his
father
well

he
loved
me
better
and
darcy
couldnt
stand
it
how
cruel

so
now
im
a
poor
footsoldier
too
lowly
even
to
be
noticed
breathe
in
i
cant
anymore

youre
hurting
betsy
there
mustve
been
a
misunderstanding

jane

you
never
think
ill
of
anybody
how
could
mr
darcy
do
such
a
thing
i
will
discover
the
truth
from
mr
bingley
this
evening
let
mr
darcy
contradict
it
himself
till
he
does

i
hope
never
to
encounter
him
poor

unfortunate

mr
wickham
wickham
is
twice
the
man
darcy
is
and

let
us
hope

a
rather
more
willing
dancer
there
they
are

look
oh

yes

billy
jane
martin
is
here
may
i
say
what
an
immense
pleasure
it
is
to
see
you
again
mrs
bennet

miss
bingley
charming
im
so
pleased
youre
here
and
how
are
you
miss
elizabeth
are
you
looking
for
someone
no

not
at
all

i
was
just
admiring
the
general
splendour
it
is
breathtaking

mr
bingley

good
you
might
have
passed
a
few
pleasantries
with
mr
bingley
ive
never
met
a
more
pleasant
gentleman
in
all
my
years
did
you
see
how
he
dotes
on
her
dear
jane

always
doing
whats
best
for
her
family
charlotte
lizzie
have
you
seen
mr
wickham
no

perhaps
hes
through
here
lizzie

mr
wickham
is
not
here

apparently

hes
been
detained
detained
where
he
must
be
here
there
you
are

mr
collins
perhaps
you
will
do
me
the
honour

miss
elizabeth
oh

i
did
not
think
you
danced

mr
collins
i
do
not
think
it
incompatible
with
the
office
of
a
clergyman
several
people

her
ladyship
included

have
complimented
me
on
my
lightness
of
foot
apparently

your
mr
wickham
has
been
called
on
some
business
to
town
but
it
does
afford
the
opportunity
to
lavish
upon
ones
partner
attentions
my
informer
tells
me
that
he
would
be
less
inclined
to
be
engaged

were
it
not
for
the
presence
of
a
certain
gentleman
which
is
my
primary
object
that
gentleman
barely
warrants
the
name
it
is
my
intention

if
i
may
be
so
bold
to
remain
close
to
you
throughout
the
evening
may
i
have
the
next
dance

miss
elizabeth
you
may
did
i
agree
to
dance
with
mr
darcy
i
dare
say
you
will
find
him
amiable
it
would
be
most
inconvenient
since
ive
sworn
to
loathe
him
for
all
eternity
i
love
this
dance

indeed

most
invigorating
it
is
your
turn
to
say
something

mr
darcy
i
talked
about
the
dance
now
you
ought
to
remark
on
the
size
of
the
room
or
the
number
of
couples
im
perfectly
happy
to
oblige

what
would
you
like
most
to
hear
that
reply
will
do
for
present
perhaps
by
and
by
i
may
observe
that
private
balls
are
much
pleasanter
than
public
ones
for
now

we
may
remain
silent
do
you
talk
as
a
rule
while
dancing
no

no

i
prefer
to
be
unsociable
and
taciturn
makes
it
all
so
much
more
enjoyable

dont
you
think
tell
me

do
you
and
your
sisters
very
often
walk
to
meryton
yes

we
often
walk
to
meryton
its
a
great
opportunity
to
meet
new
people
when
you
met
us

wed
just
had
the
pleasure
of
forming
a
new
acquaintance
mr
wickhams
blessed
with
such
happy
manners

hes
sure
of
making
friends
whether
hes
capable
of
retaining
them
is
less
so
hes
been
so
unfortunate
as
to
lose
your
friendship

that
is
irreversible
it
is

why
do
you
ask
such
a
question
to
make
out
your
character
what
have
you
discovered
very
little
i
hear
such
different
accounts
of
you
as
puzzle
me
exceedingly
i
hope
to
afford
you
more
clarity
in
the
future
is
that
mr
darcy
of
pemberley
i
believe
so
i
must
make
myself
known
to
him
hes
a
nephew
of
my
patroness

lady
catherine
he
will
consider
it
an
impertinence
mr
darcy

good
evening
what
interesting
relatives
you
have
mary

dear

youve
delighted
us
long
enough
let
the
other
young
ladies
have
a
turn
since
i
was
a
child

and
then
she
died
i
have
a
beautiful
grey
of
course

carolines
a
much
better
rider
than
i

of
course
oh

yes

we
fully
expect
a
most
advantageous
marriage
and
my
jane

marrying
so
grand

must
throw
her
sisters
in
the
way
clearly
my
family
are
seeing
who
can
expose
themselves
to
the
most
ridicule
at
least
bingley
has
not
noticed

no
i
think
he
likes
her
very
much

but
does
she
like
him
few
of
us
are
secure
enough
to
be
in
love
without
proper
encouragement
bingley
likes
her
enormously
but
might
not
do
more
if
she
does
not
help
him
on
shes
just
shy

if
he
cannot
perceive
her
regard

he
is
a
fool
we
are
all
fools
in
love
he
does
not
know
her
character
as
we
do
she
should
move
fast
and
snap
him
up
there
is
plenty
of
time
for
us
to
get
to
know
him
afterwards
i
cant
help
feeling
that
someones
going
to
produce
a
piglet
and
make
us
chase
it
oh

dear
i
do
apologise

sir
im
awfully
sorry

do
forgive
me
emily

please
mary

my
dear
mary

oh
dear

oh
dear

oh
dear
ive
been
practising
all
week

i
know

my
dear
i
hate
balls
mr
bennet

wake
up
oh

ive
never
had
such
a
good
time
charles

you
cannot
be
serious
well
have
a
wedding
here
in
less
than
three
months
if
you
ask
me

mr
bennet
mr
bennet
mary

please
thank
you

mr
hill
mrs
bennet

i
was
hoping

if
it
would
not
trouble
you
that
i
might
solicit
a
private
audience
with
miss
elizabeth
oh

certainly

lizzie
would
be
very
happy
indeed
everyone

out

mr
collins
would
like
a
private
audience
with
your
sister
wait

mr
collins
can
have
nothing
to
say
to
me
that
anybody
need
not
hear
i
desire
you
will
stay
where
you
are

everyone
else
to
the
drawing
room
mr
bennet

but
papa

stay
dear
miss
elizabeth
my
attentions
have
been
too
marked
to
be
mistaken
almost
as
soon
as
i
entered
the
house
i
singled
you
out
as
the
companion
of
my
future
life
but
before
i
am
run
away
with
my
feelings
perhaps
i
may
state
my
reasons
for
marrying
firstly

that
it
is
the
duty
of
a
clergyman
to
set
the
example
of
matrimony
in
his
parish
secondly

i
am
convinced
it
will
add
greatly
to
my
happiness
and
thirdly

that
it
is
at
the
urging
of
my
esteemed
patroness

lady
catherine
that
i
select
a
wife
my
object
in
coming
to
longbourn
was
to
choose
such
a
one
from
among
mr
bennets
daughters
for
i
am
to
inherit
the
estate
and
such
an
alliance
will
surely
suit
everyone
and
now
nothing
remains
but
for
me
to
assure
you
in
the
most
animated
language
of
the
violence
of
my
affections

mr
collins
and
no
reproach
on
the
subject
of
fortune
will
cross
my
lips
once
were
married

you
forget
i
have
given
no
answer
lady
catherine
will
thoroughly
approve
when
i
speak
to
her
of
your
modesty

economy
and
other
amiable
qualities
sir

i
am
honoured
by
your
proposal

but
i
regret
that
i
must
decline
it
i
know
ladies
dont
seek
to
seem
too
eager
mr
collins

i
am
perfectly
serious

you
could
not
make
me
happy
and
im
the
last
woman
in
the
world
who
could
make
you
happy
i
flatter
myself
that
your
refusal
is
merely
a
natural
delicacy
besides

despite
manifold
attractions
it
is
by
no
means
certain
another
offer
of
marriage
will
ever
be
made
to
you
i
must
conclude
that
you
simply
seek
to
increase
my
love
by
suspense
according
to
the
usual
practice
of
elegant
females
i
am
not
the
sort
of
female
to
torment
a
respectable
man
please
understand
me

i
cannot
accept
you
headstrong

foolish
child
dont
worry

mr
collins

well
have
this
little
hiccup
dealt
with
immediately
lizzie

lizzie
mr
bennet

were
all
in
an
uproar
you
must
come
and
make
lizzie
marry
mr
collins
mr
collins
has
proposed
to
lizzie
but
she
vowed
she
will
not
have
him

and
now
the
danger
is
mr
collins
may
not
have
lizzie
what
am
i
to
do
well

come
and
talk
to
her
tell
her
you
insist
they
marry

papa

please
you
will
have
this
house
and
save
your
sisters
from
destitution
i
cant
marry
him

go
and
say
youve
changed
your
mind
think
of
your
family

you
cannot
make
me
mr
bennet

say
something
your
mother
insists
upon
you
marrying
mr
collins
yes

or
i
shall
never
see
her
again
from
this
day
onward

you
must
be
a
stranger
to
one
of
your
parents
who
will
maintain
you
when
your
father
is
dead
your
mother
will
never
see
you
again
if
you
do
not
marry
mr
collins
and
i
will
never
see
you
again
if
you
do
thank
you

papa
ungrateful
child
i
shall
never
speak
to
you
again
not
that
i
take
much
pleasure
in
talking
people
who
suffer
as
i
do
from
nervous
complaints
can
have
no
pleasure
in
talking
to
anybody
whats
the
matter
jane
i
dont
understand
what
would
take
him
from
netherfield
why
does
he
not
know
when
hell
return
read
it
mr
darcy
is
impatient
to
see
his
sister
and
we
are
scarcely
less
eager
i
do
not
think
georgiana
darcy
has
her
equal
for
beauty
elegance
and
accomplishment

i
hope
to
call
her
hereafter
my
sister
is
that
not
clear
enough
caroline
sees
her
brother
in
love
with
you
and
has
taken
him
off
to
persuade
him
otherwise
but
i
know
her
to
be
incapable
of
wilfully
deceiving
anyone
its
more
likely
he
does
not
love
me

he
loves
you

do
not
give
up
go
to
our
aunt
and
uncles
in
london
let
it
be
known
you
are
there
and
i
am
sure
he
will
come
to
you
give
my
love
to
my
sister
and
try
not
to
be
a
burden

dear
poor
jane
still

a
girl
likes
to
be
crossed
in
love
now
and
then
it
gives
her
something
to
think
of
and
a
sort
of
distinction
amongst
her
companions
im
sure
that
will
cheer
her
up

papa

its
your
turn
now

lizzie
youve
turned
down
collins
youre
free
to
go
off

be
jilted

pleasant
fellow

happy
to

a
house

honour
miss

a
guest

had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
your
nephew
in
hertfordshire

fitzwilliam

mr
collins

you
cant

in
good
health

miss
elizabeth
they
are

thank
you
my
eldest
sister
is
in
london

perhaps
you
saw
her
there
i
havent
been
fortunate
enough
do
you
play
the
pianoforte

miss
bennet
a
little

maam

and
very
poorly

do
you
draw
no

not
at
all
your
sisters

do
they
draw
not
one
i
suppose
you
had
no
opportunity
your
mother
shouldve
taken
you
to
town
for
the
benefit
of
the
masters
my
mother
wouldnt
have
minded

but
my
father
hates
town
has
your
governess
left
you
we
never
had
a
governess
no
governess
five
daughters
brought
up
at
home
without
a
governess
i
never
heard
such
a
thing

your
mother
mustve
been
a
slave
to
your
education
not
at
all

lady
catherine
your
younger
sisters

are
they
out
in
society
yes

maam

all

all
what

all
five
out
at
once
thats
very
odd
and
you
second

the
younger
ones
out
before
the
elders
are
married
your
youngest
sisters
must
be
very
young
yes

my
youngest
is
not
but
it
would
be
hard
on
younger
sisters
not
to
have
their
amusement
because
the
elder
is
still
unmarried
it
would
hardly
encourage
sisterly
affection
upon
my
word

you
give
your
opinion
very
decidedly
for
so
young
a
person
pray

what
is
your
age
with
three
younger
sisters
grown
up

you
can
hardly
expect
me
to
own
to
it
come

miss
bennet

and
play
for
us
no

i
beg
you

for
music
is
my
delight
in
fact

there
are
few
people
in
england
who
have
more
true
enjoyment
of
music
or
better
natural
taste
if
i
had
ever
learnt

i
shouldve
been
a
great
proficient
so
would
anne

if
her
health
wouldve
allowed
her
im
not
afflicted
with
false
modesty

when
i
say
i
play
poorly
come

lizzie

her
ladyship
demands
it
how
does
georgiana
get
along

darcy
she
plays
very
well

i
hope
she
practises
no
excellence
can
be
acquired
without
constant
practice
ive
told
mrs
collins
this
though
you
have
no
instrument

youre
welcome
to
come
to
rosings
and
play
on
the
pianoforte
in
the
housekeepers
room
youll
be
in
nobodys
way
in
that
part
of
the
house
you
mean
to
frighten
me
by
coming
in
all
your
state
to
hear
me
but
i
wont
be
alarmed

even
if
your
sister
does
play
so
well
i
know
that
i
cannot
alarm
you
even
should
i
wish
it
what
was
my
friend
like
in
hertfordshire
you
really
care
to
know
prepare
yourself
for
something
very
dreadful
the
first
time
i
saw
him

he
danced
with
nobody
though
gentlemen
were
scarce
and
there
was
more
than
one
lady
without
a
partner
i
knew
nobody
beyond
my
own
party

nobody
can
be
introduced
at
a
ball
fitzwilliam

i
need
you
i
do
not
have
the
talent
of
conversing
easily
with
people
i
have
never
met
before
perhaps
you
should
take
your
aunts
advice
and
practise
dear
jane
please

do
be
seated
mr
and
mrs
collins
have
gone
to
the
village
this
is
a
charming
house
i
believe
my
aunt
did
a
great
deal
to
it
when
mr
collins
first
arrived
i
believe
so
she
could
not
have
bestowed
her
kindness
on
a
more
grateful
subject
shall
i
call
for
some
tea
no

thank
you
good
day

miss
elizabeth

its
been
a
pleasure
what
on
earth
have
you
done
to
poor
mr
darcy
every
mind
must
have
some
counsellor
to
whom
it
may
apply
for
consolation
in
distress
there
are
many
conveniences
which
others
can
supply
and
we
cannot
procure
i
have
in
view
those
objects
which
are
only
to
be
obtained
through
intercourse
forgive
me

through
the
intercourse
of
friendship
or
civility
on
such
occasions

the
proud
man
steps
forth
to
meet
you
not
with
cordiality
but
with
the
suspicion
of
one
who
reconnoitres
an
enemy
how
long
do
you
plan
to
stay
as
long
as
darcy
chooses
i
am
at
his
disposal

everyone
appears
to
be
i
wonder
he
does
not
marry
and
secure
a
lasting
convenience
of
that
kind
she
would
be
a
lucky
woman

really
he
recently
came
to
the
rescue
of
one
of
his
friends
he
saved
him
from
an
imprudent
marriage
whos
the
man
his
closest
friend

charles
bingley
did
mr
darcy
give
a
reason
for
this
interference
there
were
apparently
strong
objections
to
the
lady
what
kind
of
objections
her
lack
of
fortune
i
think
it
was
her
family
that
was
considered
unsuitable
so
he
separated
them
i
believe
so

i
know
nothing
else
miss
elizabeth
i
have
struggled
in
vain
and
can
bear
it
no
longer
these
past
months
have
been
a
torment

i
came
to
rosings
only
to
see
you
i
have
fought
against
judgement

my
familys
expectation
the
inferiority
of
your
birth

my
rank
i
will
put
them
aside
and
ask
you
to
end
my
agony
i
dont
understand

i
love
you
most
ardently
please
do
me
the
honour
of
accepting
my
hand
sir

i
appreciate
the
struggle
you
have
been
through
and
i
am
very
sorry
to
have
caused
you
pain
it
was
unconsciously
done
is
this
your
reply
yes

sir
are
you
laughing
at
me
no
are
you
rejecting
me
might
i
ask
why
with
so
little
civility
i
am
thus
repulsed
i
might
enquire
why
you
told
me
you
liked
me
against
your
better
judgement
if
i
was
uncivil

then
that
is
some
excuse
but
you
know
i
have
other
reasons

what
reasons
do
you
think
anything
might
tempt
me
to
accept
the
man
who
has
ruined
the
happiness
of
a
most
beloved
sister
do
you
deny
that
you
separated
a
young
couple
who
loved
each
other
exposing
your
friend
to
censure
for
caprice
and
my
sister
to
derision
for
disappointed
hopes
involving
them
both
in
acute
misery
i
do
not
deny
it

how
could
you
do
it
i
believed
your
sister
indifferent
to
him
i
realised
his
attachment
was
deeper
than
hers
shes
shy
bingley
was
persuaded
she
didnt
feel
strongly
you
suggested
it

for
his
own
good
my
sister
hardly
shows
her
true
feelings
to
me
i
suppose
his
fortune
had
some
bearing
i
wouldnt
do
your
sister
the
dishonour
it
was
suggested
what
was
it
was
clear
an
advantageous
marriage
did
my
sister
give
that
impression
no
no

there
was

however

your
family
our
want
of
connection
no

it
was
more
than
that

how

sir
the
lack
of
propriety
shown
by
your
mother

younger
sisters
and
your
father
forgive
me

you
and
your
sister
i
must
exclude
from
this
and
what
about
mr
wickham
mr
wickham
what
excuse
can
you
give
for
your
behaviour
you
take
an
eager
interest

he
told
me
of
his
misfortunes
oh

they
have
been
great

you
ruin
his
chances
yet
treat
him
with
sarcasm
so
this
is
your
opinion
of
me
thank
you

perhaps
these
offences
might
have
been
overlooked
had
not
your
pride
been
hurt
by
my
scruples
about
our
relationship
i
am
to
rejoice
in
the
inferiority
of
your
circumstances
and
those
are
the
words
of
a
gentleman
your
arrogance
and
conceit

your
selfish
disdain
for
the
feelings
of
others
made
me
realise
you
were
the
last
man
in
the
world
i
could
ever
marry
forgive
me

madam

for
taking
up
so
much
of
your
time
i
came
to
leave
you
this
i
shall
not
renew
the
sentiments
which
were
so
disgusting
to
you
but
if
i
may

i
will
address
the
two
offences
you
have
laid
against
me
my
father
loved
mr
wickham
as
a
son
he
left
him
a
generous
living

but
upon
my
fathers
death
mr
wickham
announced
he
had
no
intention
of
taking
orders
he
demanded
the
value
of
the
living

which
hed
gambled
away
within
weeks
he
then
wrote

demanding
more
money

which
i
refused
after
which

he
severed
all
acquaintance
he
came
back
to
see
us
last
summer

and
declared
passionate
love
for
my
sister
whom
he
tried
to
persuade
to
elope
with
him
she
is
to
inherit
�
when
it
was
made
clear
he
would
never
receive
a
penny
of
it

he
disappeared
i
will
not
attempt
to
convey
the
depth
of
georgianas
despair
she
was

years
old
as
to
the
other
matter

of
your
sister
and
mr
bingley
lizzie
lizzie

how
fortunate
you
have
arrived
your
aunt
and
uncle
are
here
to
deliver
jane
from
london
how
is
jane
shes
in
the
drawing
room
im
quite
over
him

if
he
passed
me
in
the
street

id
hardly
notice
london
is
so
diverting

its
true
theres
so
much
to
entertain
what
news
from
kent
at
least
not
much
to
entertain
lizzie

tell
mama
stop
making
such
a
fuss
why
didnt
she
ask
me
as
well
because
im
better
company
whats
the
matter
ive
just
as
much
right
lets
all
go
lydias
been
invited
to
brighton
with
the
forsters
seabathing
would
set
me
up
nicely
i
shall
dine
with
the
officers
every
night
papa

dont
let
her
go
lydia
will
never
be
easy
until
shes
exposed
herself
in
some
public
place
and
we
could
never
expect
her
to
do
it
with
so
little
inconvenience
if
you
do
not
check
her
shell
be
fixed
as
the
silliest
flirt
who
ever
made
her
family
ridiculous
and
kitty
will
follow

as
always
lizzie

we
shall
have
no
peace
until
she
goes
is
that
really
all
you
care
about
colonel
forster
is
a
sensible
man
he
will
keep
her
out
of
any
real
mischief
and
shes
too
poor
to
be
an
object
of
prey
to
anyone
its
dangerous
i
am
certain
the
officers
will
find
women
better
worth
their
while
let
us
hope

in
fact

that
her
stay
in
brighton
will
teach
her
her
own
insignificance
at
any
rate

she
can
hardly
grow
any
worse
if
she
does

wed
be
obliged
to
lock
her
up
for
the
rest
of
her
life
lizzie

youre
welcome
to
accompany
us
the
peak
district
is
not
brighton
officers
are
thin
on
the
ground
which
may
influence
your
decision
come
to
the
peak
district
with
us

lizzie

and
get
some
fresh
air
the
glories
of
nature

what
are
men
compared
to
rocks
and
mountains
men
are
either
eaten
up
with
arrogance
or
stupidity
if
they
are
amiable

they
have
no
minds
of
their
own
take
care

my
love

that
savours
strongly
of
bitterness
i
saw
mr
darcy
when
i
was
at
rosings
why
did
you
not
tell
me
did
he
mention
mr
bingley
no

he
did
not
oh

what
are
men
compared
to
rocks
and
mountains
or
carriages
that
work
where
exactly
are
we
quite
close
to
pemberley
mr
darcys
home
thats
the

so
hes
so
so
what
so
rich
by
heavens

lizzie

what
a
snob
you
are
objecting
to
mr
darcy
because
of
his
wealth

the
poor
man
cant
help
it
he
wont
be
there
anyway

these
great
men
are
never
at
home

your
master

you

mama
we
passed
sarah
sims
in
her
carriage
so
i
took
off

glove
so
she
might
see
the
ring
then
i
bowed
and
smiled
like
anything
im
sure
she
was
not
half
as
radiant
as
you

my
dear
you
must
all
go
to
brighton
that
is
the
place
to
get
husbands

i
hope
you

half
my
good
luck
i
want
to
hear
every
little
detail

lydia

dear
ive
been
enlisted
in
a
regiment
in
the
north
of
england
glad
to
hear
it
near
newcastle

we
travel
there
next
week
can
i
come
and
stay
with
you
that
is
out
of
the
question
monday
morning
came
and
i
was
in
such
a
fuss
i
dont
want
to
hear
there
was
my
aunt
preaching
away
as
if
reading
a
sermon
she
was
horrid
unpleasant

cant
you
understand
why
but
i
didnt
hear
a
word
because
i
was
thinking
of
my
dear
wickham
i
longed
to
know
if
hed
be
married
in
his
bluecoat
the
north
of
england

i
believe

boasts
some
spectacular
scenery
so
i
thought

who
is
to
be
our
best

and
settled

and
one
of
my
own
daughters
too
you
will
have
seen
it
in
the
papers
though
it
was
not
put
in
as
it
ought
to
have
been
very
short

nothing
about
her
family
yes

i
did
hear
of
it

i
offer
my
congratulations
but
it
is
very
hard
to
have
my
lydia
taken
away
from
me
mr
wickham
has
been
transferred
to
newcastle

wherever
that
is
will
you
stay

just
a
few
weeks

for
the
shooting
when

birds
i
beg
you

come
here

shoot
as
many
as

been
very
pleasant
to
see
you
all
again
miss
elizabeth

miss
bennet
you
must
come
again
last
winter

you
promised
to
have
a
family
dinner
with
us
ive
not
forgot

you
see

at
least
three
courses
excuse
me
we
were
going
to
walk
in
and
she
was
going
to
say

sit
down
so

i
feel
oh

its
a
disaster

isnt
it
its
been
miss
bennet

mr
bingley
ill
just
go
in
and
ill
just
say
it
yes

exactly
im
glad
thats
over

now
we
can
meet
as
indifferent
acquaintances
oh

yes
you
cannot
think
me
so
weak
as
to
be
in
danger
now
you
are
in
great
danger
of
making
him
as
much
in
love
with
you
as
ever
im
sorry
he
came
with
mr
darcy

dont
say
that
why
ever
not
ive
been
so
blind

what
do
you
mean
look

its
him

hes
back

hes
come
again
i
know
this
is
all
very
untoward
but
i
would
like
to
request
the
privilege
of
speaking
to
miss
bennet
everybody
to
the
kitchen
immediately
except
you

jane

dear

of
course
oh

mr
bingley

its
so
good
to
see
you
again
so
soon
first

i
must
tell
you
ive
been
the
most
unmitigated
and
comprehensive
ass
kitty

be
quiet
a
thousand
times
yes
thank
the
lord
for
that

i
thought
it
would
never
happen
i
am
confident
they
will
do
well
together
their
tempers
are
much
alike
they
will
be
cheated
assiduously
by
their
servants
and
be
so
generous
with
the
rest

they
will
always
exceed
their
income
exceed
their
income
he
has

a
year
i
knew
she
did
not
be
so
beautiful
for
nothing
must
be
free
from
all
insincerity
can
you
die
of
happiness
he
was
ignorant
of
my
being
in
town
in
the
spring
how
did
he
account
for
it
he
thought
me
indifferent
unfathomable

no
doubt
poisoned
by
his
sister
bravo

thats
the
most
unforgiving
speech
youve
ever
made
oh

lizzie

if
i
could
but
see
you
so
happy
if
there
was
such
a
man
for
you
perhaps
mr
collins
has
a
cousin
what
is
that
what
maybe
hes
changed
his
mind
lady
catherine
the
rest
of
your
offspring

i
presume
all
but
one

the
youngest
has
been
lately
married

your
ladyship
my
eldest
was
proposed
to
only
this
afternoon
you
have
a
very
small
garden

could
i
offer
you
a
cup
of
tea
absolutely
not

i
need
to
speak
to
miss
elizabeth
bennet
alone
as
a
matter
of
urgency
you
can
be
at
no
loss
to
understand
why
i
am
here
i
cannot
account
for
this
honour
at
all
i
warn
you

i
am
not
to
be
trifled
with
a
most
alarming
report
has
reached
me
that
you
intend
to
be
united
with
my
nephew

mr
darcy
i
know
this
to
be
a
falsehood

though
not
wishing
to
injure
him
by
supposing
it
possible

i
instantly
set
off
to
make
my
sentiments
known
if
you
believed
it
impossible

i
wonder
that
you
came
so
far
to
hear
it
contradicted
your
coming
will
be
a
confirmation
if
such
a
report
exists
lf
you
pretend
to
be
ignorant
of
it
has
it
not
been
industriously
circulated
by
yourself
i
have
never
heard
of
it
can
you
declare
there
is
no
foundation
for
it
i
do
not
pretend
to
possess
equal
frankness
with
your
ladyship
you
may
ask
a
question
which
i
may
choose
not
to
answer
has
my
nephew
made
you
an
offer
of
marriage
your
ladyship
has
declared
it
to
be
impossible
mr
darcy
is
engaged
to
my
daughter

now
what
have
you
to
say
if
that
is
the
case

you
cannot
suppose
he
would
make
an
offer
to
me
selfish
girl

this
union
has
been
planned
since
their
infancy
do
you
think
it
can
be
prevented
by
a
woman
of
inferior
birth
whose
own
sisters
elopement
resulted
in
a
scandalously
patchedup
marriage
only
achieved
at
the
expense
of
your
uncle
tell
me
once
and
for
all

are
you
engaged
to
him
will
you
promise
never
to
enter
into
such
an
engagement
i
will
not
and
i
certainly
never
shall
you
have
insulted
me
in
every
possible
way
and
can
now
have
nothing
further
to
say
i
must
ask
you
to
leave
immediately
i
have
never
been
thus
treated
in
my
entire
life
what
is
going
on
just
a
small
misunderstanding
for
once
in
your
life

leave
me
alone
i
couldnt
sleep

nor
i

my
aunt
yes

she
was
here
how
can
i
ever
make
amends
for
such
behaviour
after
what
youve
done
for
lydia
and

i
suspect

for
jane

it
is
i
who
should
be
making
amends
you
must
know

surely
you
must
know
it
was
all
for
you
you
are
too
generous
to
trifle
with
me
you
spoke
with
my
aunt
last
night
and
it
has
taught
me
to
hope
as
id
scarcely
allowed
myself
before
if
your
feelings
are
still
what
they
were
last
april

tell
me
so
at
once
my
affections
and
wishes
have
not
changed
but
one
word
from
you
will
silence
me
for
ever
lf

however

your
feelings
have
changed
i
would
have
to
tell
you
you
have
bewitched
me

body
and
soul

and
i
love
i
love
i
love
you
i
never
wish
to
be
parted
from
you
from
this
day
on
well

then
your
hands
are
cold
shut
the
door

please
lizzie

are
you
out
of
your
senses
i
thought
you
hated
the
man
no

papa

he
is
rich

to
be
sure
and
you
will
have
more
fine
carriages
than
jane
but
will
that
make
you
happy
have
you
no
other
objection
than
your
belief
in
my
indifference
none
at
all
we
all
know
him
to
be
a
proud

unpleasant
sort
of
fellow
but
this
would
be
nothing
if
you
liked
him
i
do
like
him
i
love
him
hes
not
proud

i
was
wrong

i
was
entirely
wrong
about
him
you
dont
know
him

papa

if
i
told
you
what
he
was
really
like
what
has
he
done
but
she
doesnt
like
him

i
thought
she
didnt
like
him
so
did
i

so
did
we
all
we
must
have
been
wrong
it
wont
be
the
first
time

will
it
no

nor
the
last

i
dare
say
i
must
pay
him
back

no
you
mustnt
tell
anyone

he
wouldnt
want
it
we
misjudged
him

papa

me
more
than
anyone

in
every
way
not
just
in
this
matter
ive
been
nonsensical
but
hes
been
a
fool
about
jane

about
so
many
other
things
but
then

so
have
i
you
see

he
and
i
are
he
and
i
are
so
similar
were
both
so
stubborn
papa

i
you
really
do
love
him

dont
you
i
cannot
believe
that
anyone
can
deserve
you
but
it
seems
i
am
overruled
so
i
heartily
give
my
consent
i
could
not
have
parted
with
you

my
lizzie

to
anyone
less
worthy
if
any
young
men
come
for
mary
or
kitty

for
heavens
sake

send
them
in
she
knew
a
trick
she
knew
how
to
turn
her
life
into
a
movie
and
watch
things
happen
not
to
her

but
to
a
girl
who
looked
just
like
her
was
she
the
runaway
with
everything
she
owned
in
a
ratty
old
backpack
or

was
she
watching
a
movie
about
a
hitchhiking
runaway
on
a
lonely
highway
a
truck
slowed
till
the
girl
squinted
in
his
headlights
but
one
good
look
at
her
and
the
trucker
couldnt
get
out
of
there
fast
enough
she
didnt
even
have
the
strength
to
curse
him
as
she
choked
on
the
dust
of
his
spinning
wheels
im
sorry

mr

norquist

i
know
i
should
have
this
by
now
youve
been
distracted
lately

aubrey
the
next
young
artist
competition
is
less
than
a
month
away
i
know

i
know
watch
this
hand
you
see
how
easy
ive
been
meaning
to
talk
to
you
you
know

ive
been
thinking

and
i
just
i
dont
know
if
im
cut
out
to
play
piano
anymore
aubrey

all
artists
feel
that
way

i�s
normal

i
i
want

i
barely
made
my
winter
admit
to
yale

and
i
could
still
blow
it
i
just
need
to
concentrate
all
of
my
efforts
into
writing
but
you
have
a
gift

an
innate
talent
you
won
the
young
artist
competition
i
mean

how
much
more
validation
do
you
need
that
was
a
long
time
ago

mr

norquist
she
always
felt
like
half
a
person
half
a
person
with
half
a
soul
sometimes

if
she
dreamed
hard
enough

she
could
bring
the
two
halves
together
but
she
always
woke
to
the
same
feelings
of
loneliness
and
loss
whered
you
find
a
blue
rose
i
passed
a
place
on
the
street

here
got
me
sheriff

several
federal

ganglia
the

organs
the
female
organs

a
little
more
experience
in
the
female
anatomy

ragged

that

but

worrier

have
kids
it
falls
away

and
they
always

well

i
hope
our
little
investigation
doesnt
interfere
with
bingo
night
i

like
half
a
person

you
know
and

all
of
a
sudden

it
dawns
on
me

steve

others
thoughts

bad
her
blood
pressures
increasing
shes
fucking

for
go�s
sake
increasing
her
thiopental
orthopedic
saw

orthopedic
saw

now
well
hey

beautiful
nobody
expected
to
see
those
eyes
for
a
while
im
in
the
hospital
youre
safe
now
what
hospital
am
i
in
where
ill
ill
get
the
doctor

okay
oh

my
god
oh

my
god
look

the
press
is
asking
questions
now

i
think
what
we
should
do
no

no

no

no
comments

no
leaks
aubrey
fleming
is
still
missing
as
far
as
the
worl�s
concerned
and
i
want
to
keep
it
that
way

everyone
at
the
hospitals
been
threatened
with
dismissal
and
obstruction
of
justice
charges
if
they
leak
a
word
of
this

we
clear
plausible
explanations

okay
number
one

he
was
done
with
her

he
left
her
on
the
side
of
the
road
to
die
but
he
didnt
count
on
her
will
to
live
i
dont
buy
it
he
wasnt
done
with
aubrey
fleming

not
by
a
long
shot
he
only
had
her
for
what



days
the
sectioning
was
just
getting
started

her
leg
wasnt
completely
off
and
why
the
hell
would
he
sew
her
fingers
back
onto
her
hand
and
her
hand
back
onto
but
wait
a
minute
remember

jennifer
toland
drowned
i
mean

now

i�s
too
early
for
an
accurate
profile
but
i
think
the
cutting
is
about
punishment
and
when
the
punishment
is
over
he
finds
a
way
for
the
death
to
happen

so
he
doesnt
have
to
be
there
now

he
doesnt
like
the
dying
part

but
hes
got
to
make
sure
it
happens
dying
freaks
him
out
i
think
she
escaped
the
only
answer
that
makes
any
sense
to
me
sure
did
miss
you
were
gonna
have
you
home
in
no
time

and
we
can
put
all
this
behind

the
pictures
of
jennifer

same
person
who

her
cut
you

you
cant
deny
that
what
do
you
remember
about
the
past
few
weeks
everything
tha�s
unusual
dakota

who
did
this
to
you
were
you
blindfolded
you
were
locked
up
it
doesnt
matter
if
it
doesnt
make
sense
to
you
well
put
the
pieces
together
all
right

so
i
got
this
new
job

night
shift
what
kind
of
job
a
hostess
at
a
gentlemens
club
dont
care
how
old
you
really
are

kiddo
your
id
says
youre


youre
fucking

to
me
an
exotic
dancer

tha�s
what
the
hostess
job
turned
out
to
be
he
coul�ve
been
there
the
first
night
i
danced

i
dont
know
everything
about
him
was
just
i
dont
know

was
intense
i
never
really
got
to
see
his
face
how
do
you
know
it
was
the
same
guy
from
the
club
i
just
knew

was
he
tall
thin
stocky
what
he
was
wearing
blue
gloves
the
rubber
kind
that
doctors
wear

are
you
sure
look

im
not
sure
about
anything

okay
what
about
when
he
cut
you
you
didnt
see
him
then
no

look

he
gave
you
drugs

aubrey

okay
to
make
you
watch
to
keep
you
awake

so
youd
have
to
have
seen
something
i
dont
lie
if
i
tell
you
i
didnt
see
him

i
didnt
fucking
see
him
how
do
you
know
it
was
the
same
guy
who
cut
you

then
youre
right

i
dont
know
aubrey

you
have
got
to
stop
playing
games
with
us
am
i
making
myself
clear
we
have
to
know
the
truth
oh

oh

im
sorry

you
want
to
know
the
truth
well

what
about
me
you
think
i
dont
how
the
fuck
would
you
feel
fingers

leg

hand

gone

i
practically
fucking
died
and
now

im
locked
up
in
the
fucking
hospital
like
a
goddamn
prisoner
so

what
are
you
saying

doctor
i
dont
know

usually
i�s
easy
to
find
the
inconsistencies
the
holes
in
the
fantasy
even
in
the
most
extreme
cases
of
posttraumatic
stress
you
get
a
tiny
measure
of
the
original
person
you
know
what
i
think

doctor
i
think
were
wasting
our
time
i
think
this
kid
is
lying
through
her
teeth

no
shes
not
lying

shes
i
dont
think
i�s
that
simple
i
thought
she
just
ran
out
of
imagination
aubrey
fleming
is
not
short
on
imagination
tha�s
for
sure

okay
so

she
gets
to
a
certain
point
in
her
story
and
she
stops
talking

why
sometimes
people
create
alter
egos
to
relay
information
that
their
primary
personalities
would
never
reveal
so

why
would
the
alter
ego
withhold
i
think
she
doesnt
tell
everybody
the
whole
story
because
she
doesnt
think
anybodys
gonna
believe
her
i
mean

shes
not
even
sure
she
believes
what
happened
to
her
unconfirmed
reports
tonight

in
this
news

exclusive
that
the
abducted
teen
has
been
found
and
has
been
secretly
held
at
new
salem
hospital

real
mothers
last
known
address
but
it
was
what
she
saw
next
that
slammed
her
in
the
gut
like
a
celestial
fist
she
stared
at
the
hospital
records
in
disbelief

it
couldnt
be
true
but
there
it
was

in
black
and
white
not
only
did
she
have
a
mother
shed
never
met
she
also
had
an
identical
twin
but
virginia
sue
moss
had
left
town
with
her
twin
sister
almost

years
ago
how
would
she
ever
find
her
other
half
she
knew
only
that
she
had
to
try

she
had
no
choice
moss
as
in
dakota
moss

yeah
so
this
proves
that
that
shes
always
been
and
always
will
be
aubrey
fleming
i
mean

shes
living
inside
a
world
she
made
up
so
the
dna
test
comparing
aubrey
and
dakota
came
back
identical
damn
right

it
did
higher
than
your
heart
odd

even
right

left
rest

motion
peace

war
love

hate
two
halves
to
everything
sometimes
people
get
cut
sometimes
people
get
cut
in
half
darker
than
the
shadowy
depths
of
the
deepest
ocean
all
the
knowledge
that
ever
was
or
ever
will
be
im
art
bell

and
these
are
the
mysteries
of
the
mind
the
best
documented
case
of
stigmatic
twins
is
that
of
joseph
k




and
his
twin
brother

jacob
jacob
k

was
a
petty
thief
with
a
gambling
problem
he
owed
more
than

to
the
mob
unable
to
pay
off
his
loan

jacob
k

was
targeted
for
assassination
on
the
night
of
december
th
the
very
same
night
jacob
k

was
gunned
down
a
deep
puncture
wound
appeared
in
joseph
k

s
neck
in
the
same
spot
lacking
all
explanation

authorities
concluded
that
joseph
k

s
wound
was
selfinflicted
they
failed

however

to
address
just
how
he
coul�ve
known
the
precise
location
of
his
brothers
mortal
wound
or
how
both
men
happened
to
die
at
the
same
hour

miles
apart
i
saw
the
light

you
all
right
yeah

i
couldnt
sleep
this
is
a
nonsmoking
house

young
lady
you
know

i
think
tha�s
the
first
time
ive
seen
you
im
sorry

no

i�s
okay

i
shouldnt
have
i
think
im
aubreys
twin
sister
her
identical
twin
sister
i
mean

hospitals
make
mistakes

we
coul�ve
been
separated
at
birth
look
at
this
house

this
life
that
your
daughter
had
why
would
i
pretend
to
be
some
loser
if
this
was
all
mine

huh
i�s
like
a
bad
dream

sweetie
and
someday
very
soon

youre
gonna
wake
up
and
realize
the
truth
but
i�s
possible
we
could
be
twins

right
you
were
all
by
yourself
in
there
no
twin
sister

just
you
im
not
much
of
a
crier

you
know
but
i
cried
when
i
saw
this
daniel
and
i
i
fell
they
made
me
stay
in
my
bed

flat
on
my
back

for
about
six
weeks
six
weeks
towards
the
end

but
it
was
worth
it
i
mean

there
were
times
when
i
thought
im
not
gonna
be
able
to
stand
another
moment
of
this
but
there
were
also
there
were
times
when
youd
get
real
still
on
me
and
id
take
both
my
hands

id
put
them
on
my
belly

and
i
said

time

barely
saw
you

and
they
took
you
away
from
me
and

touchandgo
for
two
whole
days

miss

fantastic
its

in
the
beans
and
lm
just
full
of
beans
is
that
our
set
theres
smithys
house
smithys
house
i
should
have
guessed
you
two
professionals
would
be
here
early
and
beavering
away
were
just
laying
about
drinking
capuccino
devon
makes
a
great
capuccino
care
for
one
thanks

but
freddie
and
l
just
had
a
cup
of
tea
actually

it
was
a
terrible
cup
of
tea

at
the
commissary
terrible
is
an
inadequate
description
of
it
well

l
thought
since
were
here
and
smithys
sets
been
started
we
might
go
through
some
of
those
scenes
that
take
place
there
not
the
love
scene

of
course

but
some
of
the
earlier
scenes
lets
take

for
instance

scene
billy

at
smithys
house

to
find
sue
nikki

looking
out
the
window
i
remember
that
scene
well
just
well
go
through
it
and
then
well
maybe
take
it
on
the
set
and
block
it
out
as
best
as
possible
i
guess
we
should
just
jump
right
in
that
would
be
jolly
good

ok
nikki

this
is
just
a
rough
runthrough
so
dont
be
hard
on
yourself
i
am
expecting
from
you
an
academy
award
performance
right
out
of
the
gate

so
thanks

devon

get
going

please
i
didnt
think
youd
be
here
no

of
course
you
wouldnt
thats
because
you
i
said
some
things
last
night
as
you
know
apologize
yeah
the
things
you
said
werent
the
truth
i
didnt
say

supposed
to
be
ours
and
ours
alone
well

lets
have
a
look
who
was
it
disappeared
where
its
real
hard
to
disappear
maybe
we
should
talk

maybe
this
is
the
time
lets
be
serious
for
a
moment
about
something
other
than
this
scene
sit
down

lll
tell
you
sit
down

lll
tell
you
it
was
freddie
who
first
heard
about
it
if
you
have
an
assistant
who
can
hold
his
liquor

then
freddie
can
do
that
with
the
best
of
them
somebodys
got
to
do
it

gables
dead
now

freddie
is
purposefully
out
and
about
gathering
what
in
this
business
is
the
most
valuable
commodity
information
information
is
indispensable

you
probably
know
this
from
your
own
lives
we
all
have
people
who
gather
agents

friends

producers
and
sometimes
they
share
politics

ego
kingsley
sometimes
one
just
isnt
told
the
whole
story
kingsley

get
to
the
point
its
a
remake
i
wouldnt
do
a
remake
no

no
no

l
know

of
course

but
you
didnt
know
the
original
was
under
a
differrent
name

started

but
it
was
never
finished
purposefully
not
on
me

and
l
assume
not
the
two
of
you
no

absolutely
nobody
told
me
anything
no

me
neither
uh

i
thought
this
was
an
original
script
yeah

well
anyway

the
film
was
never
finished
something
happened
before
the
film
was
finished
i
dont
understand

why
wasnt
it
finished
well

after
the
characters
had
been
filming
for
some
time
they
discovered
something
please

kingsley
the
two
leads

were
murdered
it
was
based
on
a
polish
gypsy
folktale
the
title
in
german
was
fier
sieben
and
it
was
said
to
be
cursed
so
it
turned
out
to
be
did
you
understand
what
i
said
hmm

you
dont
speak
polish
half
of
it
i
i
think
she
understands
more
than
she
lets
on
but

dont
speak

this
all
about

been
hypnotized

or
something

we
worked
our
way
to
lying
down
hmm

the
plot
thickens

who
was
on
top
i
was
straddling
him
that
was
it

so
we
made
out
for
a
little
while
on
the
couch
and
i
said

okay

floor
of
his
lake
house
he

make
sure
we
got
everything
we

flirt
shamelessly
with
him

the
sixfoot
baby
giraffe

where
a
car
gets
into
some
smashup
there
aint
no
way
in
hell
anybodys
walking
away
from
well

how
do
you
think
they
accomplish
that
cgi
well

unfortunately

pam

nowadays
more
often
than
not

you
re
right
tsk

but
back
in
the
allornothin
days
vanishing
point
days

the
dirty
mary
crazy
larry
days
the
white
line
fever
days
real
cars
smashing
into
real
cars
real
dumb
people
driving
em
so

give
the
stunt
team
the
car
you
want
to
smash
up
they
take
her
and
reinforce
that
fucker
everywhere
and
voila
you
got
yourself
a
deathproof
automobile

sense

i

could
make
a
car
deathproof
well

i
can
drive
this
baby
into

brick
wall

hour
just
for
the
experience
why
is
your
passenger
seat
in
a
box
well

this
is
a
movie
car
sometimes
when
you
re
shootin
a
crash

director
wants
to
put
a
camera
in
the

the
crash
from

a

shot

you
see

were
both
going
left
you
could
have
just
as
easily
been
going

too
and
if
that
was
the
case
it
would
have
been
a
while
before

that
it
he
was
real
lucky
thatll
be
all
well

thats
more
than
enough

and
i
wanna
thank
you

dr

block
son
of
a
bitch
so

pop
well

son
number
one
what
i
think
is
so
goddamn
ghoulish
i
hesitate
to
speak
it
out
loud
well

give
it
a
shot
well

what
we
have
here
is
a
case
of
vehicular
homicide
that
ol
boy
in
there
murdered
them
pretty
little
gals
i
mean

he
used
a
car

not
a
hatchet

but
theyre
dead
just
the
same
well

what
are
you
gonna
do
da

says
there
aint
no
crime
here
every
one
of
them
gals
was
swimming
in
alcohol
and
floatin
on
weed
and
old
hooper
in
there
came
out
clean
as
a
whistle
now

you
actually
think
that
he
premeditatively
murdered
them
gals
well

i
cant
prove
it
but
since
thinkin
dont
cost
nothin

i
can
think
it

and
i
do
yeah

but
pop

he
got
pretty
banged
up
himself
well

hell
yeah

he
got
banged
up

but
goddamn
i
mean

them
pretty
little
gals
in
there
look
like
a
goddamn
giant
chewed
em
up
and
spit
em
out
did
any
of
em
survive
two
tons
of
metal


miles
an
hour
flesh
and
bone
and
plain
old
newton
they
all
princess
died
well

id
guesstimate
its
a
sex
thing
the
only
way
i
can
figure
it
highvelocity
impact

twisted
metal

busted
glass
all
four
souls
taken
exactly
the
same
time
probably
the
only
way
that
diabolical
degenerate
can
shoot
his
goo
yeah

i
think
the
only
thing
we
can
dream
of
getting
that
bastard
on
is
vehicular
manslaughter
for
the
hitchhiker
in
the
death
box
that
was
just
plain
old

goddamn
reckless
endangerment
but
i
got
me
a
goddamn
bartender
gonna
testify
that
ol
stuntman
mike
didnt
drink
a
drop
all
night
and
his
passenger
was
left
stranded
by
her
date
in
the
goddamn
rain

no
less

and
she
asked
him
for
the
fucking
ride
now

on
paper

this
is
gonna
look
like
he
was
just
trying
to
help
her
out
i
mean

thats
the
way
the
jurys
gonna
see
it
so

what
are
you
gonna
do

pop
well

i
could
take
it
upon
myself
to
work
the
case
search
for
evidence

you
know

prove
my
theory
alert
authorities
dog
that
rotten
son
of
a
bitch
wherever
he
goes

i
go
or
i
could
spend
the
same
goddamn
amount
of
time
and
energy
following
the
nascar
circuit
hmm

ive
thought
about
it
a
lot
i
think
id
have
a
hell
of
a
lot
happier
life

the
latter
and

because
i
cant
punish
old

not
what
do
you

no

of
course
not
the
reason
cecil
hasnt
had
a

in

years
is
because
girls
will
fuck
him

and
if
you
fuck
cecil
you
dont
become
one
of
his
girlfriends
not
to
say
i
want
to
be
his
girlfriend
but
if
i
did
want
to
be
his
girlfriend

if
i
fucked
him

i
wouldnt
be
id
be
one
of
his
regulars

getting
too
fuckin

that
shit
have
you

this
straight

ve
stretched
it
out
like
you
have
with
cecil
and
you
suddenly
get
dirty
on
them

it
blows
their
mind
so
zo�

kim

and
i
are
in
the
philippines
at
an
outdoor
rave
what
were
you
working
on
three
kicks
to
the
head

part
three
and

admittedly

were
a
little
fucked
up
cheers
to
that

word
so
zo�
the
genius

wants
to
take
a
picture
of
me
its
dark
as
hell

and
you
cant
see
shit
so
shes
got
her
camera
and
keeps
saying

step
back
a
little
so
i
do
then
a
little
fu
ther
so
i
step
back
a
little
fu
ther

then
a
little
more
so
i
do
then
i
realize
im
at
the
edge
of
a
sevenfoot
concrete
ditch
with
god
knows
how
many
rocks
and
broken
bottles
and
rats
in
it

and
if
i
fell
in
that
fucking
thing
i
probably
would
have
broken
my
neck
so
i
am
yelling
at
her
zo�

you
almost
killed
me
so
we
laugh
about
it
and
walk
a
little
further
and
zo�
starts
fuckin
around
and
bam
if
she
doesnt
fall
in
the
fucking
ditch
nice
thank
you

yep

thank
you
i
remember
taking
a
step
and
looking
down
just
as
im
thinking

theres
that
ditch
abbie
was
talking
about
bam
im
in
the
fucking
ditch

you
know
what

with
zo�

the
cat
if
i
fell
in
that
fuckin
thing

they
would
have
had
to
helicopter
me
out
of
there
zo�
just
lands
on
her
feet
but
then
later
i
started
feeling
a
little
bad
about
myself
zo�
falls
in
the
ditch
and
its
nothing

were
laughing
about
it
if
i
fell
in
that
fucking
thing

i
probably
would
have
been
paralyzed
oh

honey

you
cant
think
like
that
we
all
have
our
individual
talents

and
that
just
happens
to
be
one
of
zo�s
well

physically
speaking

zo�
is
amazing
i
mean

agility

reflexes

nimbleness
theres
few
human
beings
that
can
fuck
with
zo�
on
that
front
kim

i
like
you
too
having
said
that

before
you
get
too
envious
of
zo�s
prowess
you
re
missing
the
most
important
part
of
that
story
you
didnt
fall
in
the
ditch

zo�
did
zo�
even
knew
there
was
a
ditch
there
because
you
told
her
and
she
still
fell
in
so
lees

all
have
our
talents

the
seventh

and
when
the
lamb
had
opened
the
seventh
seal
there
was
silence
in
heaven
about
the
space
of
half
an
hour
and
the
seven
angels
which
had
the
seven
trumpets
prepared
themselves
to
sound
who
are
you
i
am
death
you
have
come
for
me
i
have
been
at
your
side
for
a
long
time
my
flesh
is
afraid

but
i
am
not
you
all
say
that

but
i
give
no
respite
you
play
chess

do
you
not
how
do
you
know
that
i
have
seen
it
in
paintings
yes

i
am
quite
a
skillful
player
but
no
more
so
than
l
why
do
you
wish
to
play
chess
with
me
thats
my
concern

youre
quite
right
as
long
as
i
resist
you

i
live
if
i
win

you
set
me
free
black
for
you
it
becomes
me
well
between
a
strumpets
legs
i
lie
thats
the
place
for
such
as
l
the
lord
is
up
aloft

you
know
but
satan
finds
us
here
below
theres
talk
of
omens
and
other
horrors
two
horses
had
devoured
each
other
graves
gaped
wide
and
bones
lay
about
four
suns
were
in
the
sky
where
is
the
inn
did
he
show
you
the
way
not
exactly
what
did
he
say
nothing
was
he
mute
no

milord
he
was
most
eloquent
but
very
gloomy
have
you
had
breakfast
pity
i
cant
eat
grass
you
must
teach
me
were
feeling
the
pinch
people
here
are
not
interested
in
art
mary
i
have
seen
something
a
vision

it
was
quite
real
you
and
your
visions
i
saw
her
anyway
who
the
virgin
mary
did
you
really
see
her
i
could
have
touched
her
with
her
crown
of
gold
and
her
blue
robe
she
was
holding
the
child
and
teaching
him
to
walk
when
she
saw
me

she
smiled
i
had
tears
in
my
eyes
and
when
i
wiped
them
away

she
was
gone
and
there
was
a
great
silence
in
heaven
and
on
earth
the
things
you
make
up
you
dont
believe
me

but
it
was
true
its
not
the
reality
you
see

but
another
kind
like
the
devil
painting
the
wheels
red
and
using
his
tail
as
a
brush
why
did
you
remind
me
and
you
had
red
paint
under
your
nails
well

i
did
make
that
up
so
that
you
would
believe
my
other
visions
mind
youre
not
taken
for
a
fool
because
youre
not

at
least
not
yet
its
not
my
fault
if
i
hear
voices
and
see
the
virgin

and
if
angels
and
devils
like
my
company
i
have
told
you
once
and
for
all
i
must
have
sleep
in
the
mornings
i
have
asked
you

but
nothing
helps

now
will
you
shut
up
i
want
a
better
life
for
michael
he
is
going
to
be
a
great
acrobat
or
a
juggler
who
does
the
one
impossible
trick
what
trick
is
that
make
a
ball
stand
still
in
the
air
but
thats
impossible

y
es

for
us

but
not
for
him
always
daydreaming
ive
written
a
song
do
you
want
to
hear
it
yes

im
very
curious
a
dove
on
a
branch
at
midsummer
time
she
sang
so
sweetly
of
jesus
christ
in
heaven
is
great
rejoicing
are
you
asleep
it
was
a
lovely
song

its
not
finished
i
heard

but
ill
sleep
a
bit
more

sing
me
the
rest
later
you
just
sleep
and
sleep
is
this
a
mask
for
an
actor
the
priests
pay
well

so
i
play
going
to
play
death
scaring
decent
folk
out
of
their
wits
when
are
we
to
perform
at
the
saints
festival
in
elsinore
we
will
perform
on
the
church
steps
why
not
something
bawdy
people
like
it
better
they
say
the
plague
stalks
the
land
the
priests
speculate
in
sudden
death
and
moral
bellyache
what
parts
are
we
playing
a
fool
like
you
can
play
the
human
soul
not
a
good
part
who
decides
im
the
director
of
the
troupe
your
life

o
fool
hangs
by
a
thread
short
is
your
day
will
the
women
love
me
in
this
getup
well

what
is
it
dont
move

dont
speak
im
as
silent
as
the
grave
what
is
this
supposed
to
be
the
dance
of
death
and
this
is
death

y
es

he
dances
with
them
why
all
this
daubing
to
remind
people
of
death
that
wont
make
them
any
happier
why
make
them
happy
why
not
scare
them
then
they
wont
look
at
your
picture
a
skull
is
more
interesting
than
a
naked
woman
if
you
scare
them
theyll
think
then
they
think
and
are
still
more
scared

and
fall
into
the
arms
of
the
priests
thats
not
my
business

youre
only
painting
your
picture
i
paint
life
as
it
is

then
folk
can
do
as
they
like
that
makes
people
angry
then
i
paint
something
funny
a
man
must
live
at
least
till
the
plague
takes
him
the
plague

ugh
you
should
see
the
abscess
the
limbs
knotted
in
frenzy
unpleasant
they
try
to
tear
out
the
boils
they
bite
their
hands
scratch
open
their
veins
scream
in
agony
scared
you
dont
know
me
whats
that
rubbish
there
people
think
the
plague
is
a
punishment
from
god
crowds
wander
the
land
lashing
each
other
to
please
the
lord
lashing
each
other
y
es

its
a
horrible
sight
you
feel
like
hiding
when
they
pass
give
me
a
gin

ive
had
nothing
but
water
i
feel
as
thirsty
as
a
desert
camel
scared
after
all
i
want
to
confess
as
best
i
can
but
my
heart
is
void
the
void
is
a
mirror
i
see
my
face
and
feel
loathing
and
horror
my
indifference
to
men
has
shut
me
out
i
live
now
in
a
world
of
ghosts
a
prisoner
in
my
dreams
yet
you
do
not
want
to
die

yes

i
do
knowledge
you
want
an
guarantee
call
it
what
you
will
is
it
so
hard
to
conceive
god
with
ones
senses
why
must
he
hide
in
a
midst
of
vague
promises
and
invisible
miracles
how
are
we
to
believe
the
believers
when
we
dont
believe
ourselves
what
will
become
of
us
who
want
to
believe

but
cannot
and
what
of
those
who
neither
will
nor
can
believe
why
can
i
not
kill
god
within
me
why
does
he
go
on
living
in
a
painful

humiliating
way
i
want
to
tear
him
out
of
my
heart
but
he
remains
a
mocking
reality
which
i
cannot
get
rid
of
do
you
hear
me
i
hear
you
i
want
knowledge

not
belief

not
surmise

but
knowledge
i
want
god
to
put
out
his
hand
show
his
face

speak
to
me
but
he
is
silent
i
cry
to
him
in
the
dark

but
there
seems
to
be
no
one
there
perhaps
there
is
no
one
there
then
life
is
a
senseless
terror
no
man
can
live
with
death
and
know
that
everything
is
nothing
most
people
think
neither
of
death
nor
nothingness
until
they
stand
on
the
edge
of
life
and
see
the
darkness
ah

that
day
we
must
make
an
idol
of
our
fear
and
call
it
god
death
visited
me
this
morning
we
are
playing
chess
this
respite
enables
me
to
perform
a
vital
errand
what
errand
my
whole
life
has
been
a
meaningless
search
i
say
it
without
bitterness
or
selfreproach
i
know
it
is
the
same
for
all
but
i
want
to
use
my
respite
for
one
significant
action
so
you
play
chess
with
death
he
is
a
skillful
tactician
but
i
have
not
yet
lost
one
piece
how
can
you
outwit
death
by
a
combination
of
bishop
and
knight
i
will
break
his
flank
i
shall
remember
that
traitor
you
have
tricked
me
but
ill
find
a
way
out
we
will
resume
our
game
at
the
inn
this
is
my
hand

i
can
move
it
the
blood
is
pulsing
in
my
veins
the
sun
is
still
at
the
zenith
and
l

antonius
block
am
playing
chess
with
death
my
master
and
i
have
been
abroad
the
crusades
ten
years
in
the
holy
land
bitten
by
snakes
and
flies
slaughtered
by
savages

poisoned
by
bad
wine
made
lousy
by
women

rotting
with
fever
all
for
the
glory
of
god
the
glory
of
god
our
crusade
was
so
stupid
that
only
an
idealist
could
have
thought
it
out
that
was
horrid
about
the
plague
its
worse
than
that
whichever
way
we
turn

our
backsides
behind
us
backside
behind

how
true

how
true
heres
squire
j�ns

he
grins
at
death
chuckles
at
the
lord

laughs
at
himself
and
smiles
at
the
girls
his
world
exists
only
for
himself
absurd
to
all

even
to
himself
meaningless
in
heaven

indifferent
in
hell
whats
that
stinking
soup
good
for
she
has
had
carnal
knowledge
of
the
evil
one
and
now
shes
in
the
stocks
shes
to
be
burnt
tomorrow

but
we
must
keep
the
devil
away
with
the
aid
of
that
stinking
muck
blood
and
gall
of
a
black
dog
the
evil
one
cant
stand
the
smell
have
you
seen
the
devil
you
must
not
talk
to
her

is
that
so
dangerous
she
is
thought
to
be
the
cause
of
the
plague
fate
is
a
villain
and
youre
a
poor
wretch
now
bounding
with
glee
now
crawling
with
worms

profitable
trade

pain
in
your
belly
now

understand
these
ten
wasted
years
we
were
too
welloff

satisfied
the
lord

to
chasten
our
pride
so
he
sent
you
to
poison
my
masters
mind
i
was
in
good
faith
now

become
a
thief

behind
the
curtain
dont
stand
there
gaping

ugly
the
horse
is
up
the
tree

crowing
the
road
is
wide
but
the
gate
narrow
the
black
one
dances
on
the
shore
the
hen
mews
in
a
lake
so
dark
the
day
is
red
but
the
fish
is
dead
the
black
one
squats
on
the
shore
the
snake
flaps
high
in
the
sky
the
virgin
is
pale
but
the
mouses
content
the
black
one
runs
on
the
shore
the
goat
hisses
with
his
two
teeth
the
blast
is
heavy
the
waves
break
the
black
one
makes
dung
on
the
shore
the
sow
lays
eggs
and
the
cat
grunts
the
night
is
soot
and
the
dark
remains
the
black
one
stays

stays
on
the
shore
god
is
punishing
us
we
shall
all
perish
by
the
black
death
you
there

gaping
like
cattle
and
you

bloated
with
complacency
this
might
be
your
last
hour
death
is
behind
your
back
his
scythe
flashes
above
your
heads
which
of
you
will
he
strike
first
you
there

with
the
stare
of
a
goat
will
tonight
see
your
last
twisted
smile
you

woman

full
of
the
lust
of
life
will
you
wither
before
the
dawn
you

with
the
swollen
nose
will
you
pollute
the
earth
for
another
year
do

to
die

all
doomed

spring
is
best
of

i
wont
bore

i
dont

so
solemn
was
she
your
beloved

wrote
songs
to
her
eyes
we
hunted

we
danced

the
house
was
full
of
life
will
you
have
some
strawberries
to
believe
is
to
suffer
it
is
like
loving
someone
in
the
dark
who
never
answers
how
unreal
that
is
in
your
company
it
means
nothing
to
me
now
youre
not
so
solemn
now
i
shall
remember
this
hour
of
peace

strawberries

the
bowl
of
milk
your
faces
in
the
dusk
michael
asleep

joseph
with
his
lute
i
shall
remember
our
words
and
shall
bear
this
memory
between
my
hands
as
carefully
as
a
bowl
of
fresh
milk
and
this
will
be
a
sign
and
a
great
content
i
have
been
waiting
forgive
me

i
was
delayed
as
i
have
given
away
my
strategy

i
beat
a
retreat
here

is
your
turn
why
so
pleased
that
is
my
secret
i
take
your
knight
as
you
were
meant
to
have
you
tricked

into
the
trap

of
yourself
our
game

much
to
do
but
our
game

i
havent
found
her
its
hell

them
while

fun
lasts
nagging
and
pigs
swill
babies
wetting
themselves
scratches
and
abuse
a
witch
for
a
motherinlaw
and
when
you
get
into

new
song
tears
and
whining

you
greasy
cuckold
love
is
nothing
but
lust
and
cheating
and
lies
it
hurts
all
the
same
love

the
blackest
of
all
plagues
but
you
dont
even
die
of
it

and
usually
it
passes
no

mine
isnt
passing
of
course
it
will
only
fools
die
of
love
if
everything
is
imperfect

this
world

perfect
in
its
imperfection

hear
a
fox

or
an
owl
or
a
human
voice
besides
our
own
where
are
you
going
to
the
stake

the
witch
why
burn
her
at
night
when
people
need
diversion
shut
up

for
gods
sake
the
devil
is
with
her
then
you
are
eight
brave
men
weve
been
paid

this
is
a
volunteer
job
they
say
youve
had
commerce
with
the
devil
why
do
you
ask
for
very
personal
reasons
i

too

want
to
meet
him
i
must
ask
him
about
god
surely
he
knows
you
can
see
him
any
time
if
you
do
as
i
say
look
into
my
eyes

do
you
see
him
i
see
terror
nothing
else
nothing
no
one
is
he
not
behind
you
there
is
no
one
he
is
with
me
everywhere
if

stretch
out
my
hand

him
even
now
the
fire
wont
hurt
me
has
he

the
priests

what
have
you
done
to
the
child

you
never
stop
asking
questions

to
be
careful

her
this
will

silence
in
heaven
about
the
space
of
half
an
hour
and
the
seven
angels
which
had
the
seven
trumpets
the
first
angel
sounded

and
there
followed
hail
and
fire
mingled
with
blood
and
they
were
cast
upon
the
earth
and
the
third
part
of
the
trees
was
burnt
up
and
all
the
green
grass
was
burnt
up
and
the
second
angel
sounded
and
as
it
were
a
great
mountain
burning
with
fire
was
cast
into
the
sea
and
the
third
part
of
the
sea
became
blood
was
anyone
there
no

milord

i
saw
no
one
and
the
third
angel
sounded
and
there
fell
a
great
star
from
heaven
burning
as
if
it
were
a
lamp
and
the
name
of
the
star
is
called
wormwood

harry

some
within
the
ministry

strongly
discourage
me
from
divulging
what

l
think
that
you
need
to

the
facts

this
anything
to
do
with
sirius
black

that

say
his
name
when
you
stopped
youknowwho
black
lost
everything
but
to
this
day

he
still
remains
a
faithful
servant
and
in
his
mind
you
are
the
only
thing
that
stands
in
the
way
of
youknowwho
returning
to
power
and
that
is
why
he
has
escaped
from
azkaban
to
find
you
harry

to
me
that
whatever
you

harry

by
our
excellent
feast
first

lm
pleased
to
welcome
professor
rj

lupin
whos
kindly
consented
to
fill
the
post
of
defense
against
the
dark
arts
teacher
good
luck

professor
of

shove

malfoy
how

our
care
of
magical
creatures
teacher
has
decided
to
retire
in
order
to
spend
more
time
with
his
remaining
limbs
fortunately

lm
delighted
to
announce
that
his
place
will
be
taken
by
none
other
than
our
own
rubeus
hagrid
finally

on
a
more
disquieting
note
at
the
request
of
the
ministry
of
magic
hogwarts
will

until
further
notice

play
host
to
the
dementors
of
azkaban
until
such
a
time
as
sirius
black
is
captured
the
dementors
will
be
stationed
at
every
entrance
to
the
grounds
now
whilst
lve
been
assured
that
their
presence
will
not
disrupt
our
daytoday
activities
a
word
of
caution
dementors
are
vicious
creatures

theyll
not
distinguish
between
the
one
they
hunt
and
the
one
who
gets
in
their
way
therefore

l
must
warn
each
and
every
one
of
you
to
give
them
no
reason
to
harm
you
lt
is
not
in
the
nature
of
a
dementor
to
be
forgiving
but
you
know

happiness
can
be
found
even
in
the
darkest
of
times
if
one
only
remembers
to
turn
on
the
light
fortuna
major

mr

whatever
a

what
makes
them
so
so
terrifying

part

you
see

the
incantation

not

what
really
finishes
a
boggart
is
laughter

force
it
to
assume
a
shape
you
find
truly
amusing

have
too
much
of
a
good
thing
remember

these
visits
to
hogsmeade
village
are
a
privilege
should
your
behavior
reflect
poorly
on
the
school
that
privilege
shall
not
be
extended
again
no
permission
form
signed

no
visiting
the
village
thats
the
rule

potter
those
with
permission

follow
me

those
without

stay
put
l
thought
if
you
signed
it

then
l
could
l
cant

only
a
parent
or
a
guardian
can
sign
since
l
am
neither

it
would
be
inappropriate
lm
sorry

potter

thats
my
final
word

about
it

guys

see
you
later
professor

can
l
ask
you
something
you
want
to
know
why
l
stopped
you
facing
that
boggart

yes
l
thought
itd
be
obvious
l
assumed
it
would
take
the
shape
of
lord
voldemort
l
did
think
of
voldemort
at
first
but
then
l
remembered
that
night
on
the
train
and
the
dementor

lm
very
impressed
that
suggests
what
you
fear
the
most
is
fear
itself
this
is
very
wise
before
l
fainted
l
heard
something
screaming
dementors
force
us
to
relive
our
very
worst
memories
our
pain
becomes
their
power
l
think
it
was
my
mother
the
night
she
was
murdered
the
very
first
time
l
saw
you

harry

l
recognized
you
immediately
not
by
your
scar

by
your
eyes
theyre
your
mother

lilys
oh

yes

l
knew
her
your
mother
was
there
for
me
at
a
time
when
no
one
else
was
not
only
was
she
a
singularly
gifted
witch
she
was
also
an
uncommonly
kind
woman
she
had
a
way
of
seeing
the
beauty
in
others
even

and
most
especially

when
that
person
could
not
see
it
in
themselves
and
your
father

james

on
the
other
hand
he
he
had
a
certain

shall
we
say

talent
for
trouble
a
talent

rumor
has
it

passed
on
to
you
youre
more
like
them
than
you
know

harry
ln
time

come

completely
undetected
quite
remarkable

any
theories

how
he

many

each
as
unlikely
as
the
next
you
may
recall
prior
to
the
start
of
term
l
expressed
concerns
about
your
appointment
of
professor
not
a
single
professor
inside
this
castle
would
help
sirius
black
enter
it
lm
quite
convinced
the
castle
is
safe
and
lm
more
than
willing
to
send
the
students
to
their
houses
what
about
potter
should
he
be
warned
perhaps

but
for
now

let
him
sleep
for
in
dreams

we
enter
a
world
thats
entirely
our
own

highest
cloud
turn

me

sir

wheres
professor
lupin
thats
not
really
your
concern

the
present
time

sir
an
animagus
is
a
wizard
who
elects
to
turn
into
an
animal
a
werewolf
has
no
choice
with
each
full
moon
he
no
longer
remembers
who
he
is

hed
kill
his
best
friend
the
werewolf
only
responds

thank
you

mr

thats
the
second
time
youve

out

five

mr

contraction
of
the
anglosaxon
word
wer

man

and
wolf

werewolf

there
are
several
ways
to

what
do
you

he
fell
over


feet
lets
walk
you
off
a
tower
and
see
what
you
look
like
probably
a
right
sight
better
than
he
normally
does
how
are
you
feeling
oh

brilliant
you
gave
us
a
right
good
scare
what
happened
well

you
fell
off
your
broom

no
one
blames
you

harry
dementors
arent
supposed
to
be
on
the
grounds

dumbledores
furious
after
he
saved
you

he
sent
them
off
theres
something
else
you
should
know
too
when
you
fell

your
broom
sort
of
blew
into
the
whomping
willow

and
im
sorry
to
hear
about
your
broomstick
ls
there
no
chance
of
fixing
it
professor

why
do
the
dementors
affect
me
so
l
mean

more
than
everyone
else
listen
dementors
are
the
foulest
creatures
to
walk
this
earth
they
feed
on
every
good
feeling

every
happy
memory
until
a
person
is
left
with
absolutely
nothing
but
his
worst
experiences
you
are
not
weak

harry
dementors
affect
you
most
because
there
are
true
horrors
in
your
past
horrors
your
classmates
can
scarcely
imagine
you
have
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
lm
scared

the
one
on
the

away
there
was
only
one
that
night
but
you
made
it
go
away

l
dont
pretend
to
be
an
expert

harry
but
as
the
dementors
seem
to
have
developed
an
interest
in
you
perhaps
l
should
teach
you

but

the
holidays
for
now

professor
dumbledore

me
what
this
is
all
about
years
ago

when
harry
potters
parents
realized
they
were
marked
for
death
remember
they
hid

few
knew
where
they
were
one
who
did
was
sirius
black

and
he
told
youknowwho
not
only
did
black
lead
him
to
the
potters
that
night
he
also
killed
peter
pettigrew
peter
pettigrew
little
lump
of
a
boy
always
trailing
after
black

l
remember
never
let
james
and
sirius
out
of
his
sight
what
happened
peter
tried
to
warn
the
potters
and
might
have

had
he
not
run
into
an
old
friend

sirius
black
black
was
vicious

he
didnt
kill
pettigrew
he
destroyed
him
a
finger

thats
all
that
was
left

a
finger

nothing
else
sirius
black
may
not
have
put
his
hands
to
the
potters
but
hes
the
reason
theyre
dead

he
wants
to
finish
things
l
dont
believe
it

thats
not
the
worst
of
it
what
could
be
worse

sirius

this
day
harry

there
you

you
came
are
you
sure
about
this

harry
this
is
very
advanced
magic
well
beyond
the
ordinary
wizarding
level
well

everythings
prepared
the
spell
lm
going
to
teach
you
is
called
the
patronus
charm
did
you
ever
hear
of
it
no
well
a
patronus
is
a
positive
force

for
the
wizard
who
conjures
one
it
works
like
a
shield

with
the
dementor
feeding
on
it
rather
than
him
but
in
order
for
it
to
work

you
need
to
think
of
a
memory
not
just
any
memory

a
very
happy
memory

a
very
powerful
memory
can
you
do
this
yes

very
well
close
your
eyes
concentrate
explore
your
past
do
you
have
a
memory
allow
it
to
fill
you
up

way
that
bloodthirsty
beast
of
hers
is
always
lurking
about

take
better
care
of
your
pets
your
cat
killed
him
did
not
did

how
did
it
go

hagrid
the
hearing

off

the
committee
members
took
turns
talking
about
why
we
were
there
l
got
up
and
did
my
piece

said
how
buckbeak
was
a
good
hippogriff

always
cleaned
his
feathers
and
then
lucius
malfoy
got
up

well

you
can
imagine
he
said
buckbeak
was
a
deadly
and
dangerous
creature
who
would
kill
you
as
soon
as
look
at
you
and
then
he
asked
for
the
worst

did
old
lucius
theyre
not
sacking
you
no

lm
not
sacked
spiders
theres
theres
spiders

spiders

they
want
me
to
tapdance
l
dont
wanna
tapdance
tell
those
spiders
right

yeah

them

lll
tell
them
always
trailing
after
sirius
black

black
was
vicious
he
didn
t
kill
pettigrew

he
destroyed
him
put
that
light
out
sorry
watch
it
there

boy

were
trying
to
sleep
here
mischief
managed

nox
what
are
you
doing
wandering
the
corridors
at
night
l
was
sleepwalking
how
extraordinarily
like
your
father
you
are

potter
he

too

was
exceedingly
arrogant

strutting
about
the
castle
my
dad
didnt
strut

and
nor
do
l
lf
you
dont
mind

l
would
appreciate
it
if
you
could
lower
your
wand
turn
out
your
pockets
spare
bit
of
parchment

really
open
it
reveal
your
secrets
offer
their
compliments
to
professor
snape
and
and
request
he
keep
his
large
nose
out
of
other
peoples
business
you
insolent
little
professor
well

well

lupin
out
for
a
little
walk
in
the
moonlight

are
we
harry

are
you
all
right
that
remains
to
be
seen
l
have
now
just
confiscated
a
rather
curious
artifact
take
a
look

lupin

supposed
to
be
your
area
of
expertise
clearly

its
full
of
dark
magic

l
seriously
doubt
it

severus
lt
looks
as
though
its
a
parchment
designed
to
insult
anyone
who
tries
to
read
it

l
suspect
its
a
zonko
product
nevertheless

l
shall
investigate
any
hidden
qualities
it
may
possess
lt
is

after
all

as
you
say

my
area
of
expertise
harry

would
you
come
with
me

please
professor

good
night
are
you
deaf
put
that
light
out
l
havent
the
faintest
idea
how
this
map
came
to
be
in
your
possession
but
quite
frankly

l
am
astounded
that
you
didnt
hand
it
in
did
it
never
occur
to
you
that
this

in
the
hands
of
sirius
black
is
a
map
to
you
no

no

sir
your
father
never
set
much
store
by
the
rules
either
but
he
and
your
mother
gave
their
lives
to
save
yours
gambling
their
sacrifice
by
wandering
the
castle
unprotected
with
a
killer
on
the
loose
seems
to
me
a
poor
way
to
repay
them
now

l
will
not
cover
up
for
you
again
do
you
hear
me
yes

sir
l
want
you
to
return
to
your
dormitory
and
stay
there
and
dont
take
any
detours

lf
you
do

l
shall
know
professor

just
so
you
know

l
dont
think
that
map
always
works
earlier

it
showed
someone
in
the
castle

someone
l
know
to
be
dead
oh

really
and
who
might
that
be
peter
pettigrew
thats
not
possible
lts
just
what
l
saw
good
night

professor
broaden
your
minds

you
must
look
beyond
the
art
of
crystal
gazing
is
in
the
clearing
of
the
lnner
eye
only
then
can
you
see

try
again
now

what
do
we
have
here
do
you
mind
me
trying
the
grim

possibly
my
dear

from
the
first
moment
you
stepped
foot
in
my
class
l
sensed
that
you
did
not
possess
the
proper
spirit
for
the
noble
art
of
divination

no

you
see

there
you
may
be
young
in
years

but
your
heart
is
as
shriveled
as
an
old
maids

your
soul
as
dry
as
the
pages
of
the
books
to
which
you
so
desperately
cleave
have
l
said
something
shes
gone
mental

hermione
has

not
that
she
wasnt
always
mental

what
all
they

endless
jack

you

hereby
charged
with

counts
of
attempted
upstaging
of
santa
claus
you
froze
a
volcano
in
hawaii

you
made
it
snow
in
the
amazon
and
you
frosted
mexico

sending
all
of
the
geese
north
for
the
winter
you
violated
the
legendary
figures
code
of
conduct
in
a
manner
that
is
wilful
and
malicious
excuse
me

did
you
just
accuse
me
of
being
skilful
and
delicious
please

guilty
as
charged
you
herald
the
season

youre
not
a
holiday
youre
the
best
friend

not
the
leading
man
and
you
kill
fruit
all
in
favour
of
suspending
jack
frost
from
the
legendary
council

say
wait
a
minute
father
time

wait
a
minute
you
gotta
understand

i
have
enormous
untapped
potential
but
all
i
am
year
after
year
is
an
opening
act
a
setup
man
for
mr
big
why
dont
you
let
that
go
no
we
have
the
same
conversation
every
year
you
get
the
soda
cans

the
beautiful
adoring
wife

get
a
few
runny
noses
and
some
dead
citrus
you

jack

its
no
picnic
being
me
because
of
problems
an
entire
continent
might
go
without
toys

thats
right
on
top
of
that

ive
got
to
protect
the
secret
of
santa
because
the
inlaws
mr
and
mrs
inbadmoodeverytime
lturnaround
are
coming
not
supposed
to

gotta
come
up

a
solution
on

a
father
again

i
wasnt
all
that
good
at
it
the
first
time
oh

santa
we
had
no
idea

i

happy
they

japan
was
made
by
a
sword
they
say
the
old
gods
dipped
a
coral
blade
into
the
ocean
and
when
they
pulled
it
out

four
perfect
drops
fell
back
into
the
sea
and
those
drops
became
the
islands
of
japan
i
say
japan
was
made
by
a
handful
of
brave
men
warriors
willing
to
give
their
lives
for
what
seems
to
have
become
a
forgotten

renegades
hes
even
read
your
book

some
comfort
in
the
emptiness
of
the
sea
no
past

no
future
and
then
at
once

i
am
confronted
by
the
hard
truth
of
present
circumstances
i
have
been
hired
to
help
suppress
the
rebellion
of
yet
another
tribal
leader
apparently

this
is
the
only
job
for
which
i
am
suited
i

beset
by
the
ironies
of
my
life
yokohama
harbor
captain
algren

l
presume
yes
jolly
good

how
do
you
do
simon
graham
twenty
years
ago

this
was
a
sleepy
little
town
now
look
at
it
you
see

the
emperor
is
mad
for
all
things
western
and
the
samurai
believe
its
changing
too
fast
the
ancient
and
the
modern
are
at
war
for
the
soul
of
japan
so
your
new
employer

mr

omura

is
bringing
in
every
western
expert
he
can
get
lawyers
from
france

engineers
from
germany

architects
from
holland
and
now

of
course

warriors
from
america
l
came
over
with
the
british
trade
mission

oh

years
ago
l
was
soon
relieved
of
my
position
l
had
an
unfortunate
tendency
to
tell
the
truth
in
a
country
where
no
one
ever
says
what
they
mean
so
now

l
very
accurately
translate
other
peoples
lies
for

years

no
emperor
was
even
seen
by
a
commoner
you
have
to
realize
what
an
honor
this
is

lts
all
highly
ritualized

of
course
you
may
look
at
him

but
do
not
speak
unless
spoken
to
lf
he
stands

you
must
bow

lf
he
bows

you
must
bow
lower
do
l
look
presentable
l
havent
worn
this
in
a
decade
rather
snug
around
the
midriff
and
bow
the
divine
emperor
meiji
bids
you
welcome
he
is
grateful
for
the
assistance
your
country
offers
we
hope
to
accomplish
the
same
national
harmony
you
enjoy
in
your
homeland
the
emperor
is
most
interested
in
your
american
lndians
if
you
have
fought
against
them
in
battle
we
have

your
highness

the
red
man
is
a
brutal
adversary
the
emperor
wishes
to
ask
captain
algren
if
it
is
true
they
wear
eagle
feathers
and
paint
their
faces
before
going
into
battle
and
that
they
have
no
fear
they
are
very
brave
bow
thank
you
very
much
and
step
back
step
back

step
back
and
turn
right

you
little
bastards
you
will
stand
up
straight
or
l
will
personally
shitkick
well
done

sergeant
when
you
understand
the
language

everything
falls
into
place
the
first
rank
will
kneel

rifles
at
the
ready
the
second
rank
july
nd
for
six
months
work

i
am
to
receive
three
years
of
captain
s
pay
teaching
orientals
to
soldier
they
are
an
army
of
conscripts
most
of
them
are
peasants
who
have
never
even
seen
a
gun
they
are
led
by
general
hasegawa

a
man
of
small
stature
who
nonetheless
commands
enormous
respect
what
can
the
general
tell
me
about
this
man

this
samurai

katsumoto
he
seems
to
have
great
knowledge
of
katsumoto
and
his
rebellion
i
will
count
on
his
help
when
facing
the
samurai
who
supplies
their
weapons
katsumoto
no
longer
dishonors
himself
by
using
firearms

you
see
he
uses
no
firearms
to
those
who
honor
the
old
ways

katsumoto
is
a
hero
how
well
does
he
know
him
the
general
and
katsumoto
fought
together
for
the
emperor
he
fought
with
the
samurai
he
is
samurai
you
must
understand

katsumoto
pledged
his
sword
to
defend
the
emperor
they
say
that
a
samurais
sword
is
his
soul
samurai
are
paradoxical
lve
tried
to
write
about
them

but
they
keep
to
themselves
the
bastards
are
still
wearing
armor
when
the
lrish
were
comporting
themselves
in
loincloths
these
chaps
were
the
most
sophisticated
warriors
on
earth
l
need
information
on
their
battle
tactics
l
have
several
more
books
just
waiting
to
be
translated
hell
be
speaking
the
lingo
in
no
time
you
should
hear
him
blather
on
in
blackfoot
a
fellow
linguist
oh

capital
come
on

sir

a
word
or
two
in
the
savage
tongue
just
hello
or
goodbye
or
no

no

no
cut
his
tongue
out
and
boil
him
in
oil
early
day
tomorrow

captain
lts
about
bedtime

isnt
it
l
always
had
a
fascination
with
scalping
l
never
quite
understood
its
technique
lmagine
someone
who
hates
you
with
the
utmost
intensity
grabbing
a
handful
of
your
hair
while
youre
lying
prostrate
and
helpless
and
scraping
a
dull
blade
of
a
rusty
knife
around
your
scalp
with
a
sawlike
motion
and
let
your
imagination
grasp

if
you
can

the
effect
of
a
strong

quick
jerk
on
the
turf
of
your
hair
to
release
any
clinging
particles
would
have
on
your
nervous
system
and
youll
have
some
idea
of
how
it
feels
to
be
scalped
mr

graham
how
soon
can
you
translate
those
books
right
away
lm
just
delighted
youre
taking
such
an
interest
in
samurai
l
dont
give
a
damn
about
the
samurai

l
want
to
know
my
enemy
l
shall
not
sleep
until
it
is
done

my
railroad

superior
firepower
and

yesterday
that
is
your

correct
protecting

well
done

the
way
of
the
japanese
sword
yes

indeed
you
fought
against
your
red
lndians
tell
me
of
your
part
in
this
war
why
l
wish
to
learn
read
a
book

l
would
rather
have
a
good
conversation
why
because
we
are
both
students
of
war
you
were
the
general
of
your
army
l
was
a
captain
this
is
a
low
rank
a
middle
rank
and
who
was
your
general
dont
you
have
a
rebellion
to
lead
people
in
your
country
do
not
like
conversation
he
was
a
lieutenant
colonel
his
name
was
custer
l
know
this
name
he
killed
many
warriors
oh

yes

many
warriors
so
he
was
a
good
general
no

no

he
wasnt
a
good
general

he
was
arrogant
and
foolhardy
he
got
massacred
because
he
took
a
battalion
against

angry
lndians
two
thousand
lndians
how
many
men
for
custer
two
hundred
and
eleven
l
like
this
general
custer
he
was
a
murderer
who
fell
in
love
with
his
own
legend
and
his
troopers
died
for
it
l
think
this
is
a
very
good
death
maybe
you
can
have
one
like
it
someday
lf
it
is
in
my
destiny
what
do
you
want
from
me
what
do
you
want
for
yourself
why
are
we
having
these
conversations
what
the
hell

im
treated
with
a
kind
of
a
mild
neglect
as
if
i
were
a
stray
dog
or
an
unwelcome
guest
everyone
is
polite

everyone
smiles
and
bows
but
beneath
their
courtesy

i
detect
a
deep
reservoir
of
feeling
they
are
an
intriguing
people
from
the
moment
they
wake
they
devote
themselves
to
the
perfection
of
whatever
they
pursue
i
have
never
seen
such
discipline
i
am
surprised
to
learn
that
the
word
samurai
means
to
serve
and
that
katsumoto
believes
his
rebellion
to
be
in
the
service
of
the
emperor

you
see

you
were
right

last

not
prepared
to

you
were
right

wrong

ready
lf
katsumoto
is
allowed
to
attract
other
samurai
to
his
cause
we
will
have


years
of

something

the
offer

lt

offer
mr

l
read
every
law
carefully
yet
you
bring

into
this
chamber
this
chamber

a
nation
of
whores

minister
katsumoto

it
is
with
great
regret

ask
you
to

your
sword
this
sword

the
emperor
only
he
can
command
me
to
remove
it
the
emperors
voice

of
service
discipline
compassion
the
way
of
the
samurai
is
not
necessary
anymore
necessary
what
could
be
more
necessary
l
will
die
by
the
sword
my
own
or
my
enemys
then
let
it
be
your
enemys
together

we
will
make
the
emperor
hear
you
he
was
a
good
man
will
you
fight
the
white
men

too
lf
they
come
here

yes
because
they
come
to
destroy
what
l
have
come
to
love
the
way
of
samurai
is
difficult
for
children

he
misses
his
father
and
he
is
angry
because
l
am
the
cause
of
that
no

he
is
angry
because
he
fears
you
will
die
as
well
my
father
taught
me
it
is
glorious
to
die
in
battle
that
is
what
he
believed
l
would
be
afraid
to
die
in
battle
so
would
l
but
you
have
been
in
many
battles
and
l
was
always
afraid
l
dont
want
you
to
go
ld
say
two
full
regiments
theyll
come
in
waves
of
a
thousand
and
they
have
the
howitzers
lt
makes
no
difference

they
will
come

and
we
will
make
our
stand
how
many
men
will
we
have
maybe
like
general
custer

huh
there
was
once
a
battle
at
a
place
called
thermopylae
three
hundred
brave
greeks
held
off
a
persian
army
of
a
million
men
a
million

you
understand
this
number
for
two
days
the
greeks
made
them
pay
so
dearly
the
persian
army
lost
all
taste
for
battle
and
were
defeated
soon
after
what
do
you
have
in
mind
take
away
the
advantage
of
their
guns
theyre
overconfident

well
use
that

lure
them
close
close
enough
for
a
sword
you
believe
a
man
can
change
his
destiny
l
think
a
man
does
what
he
can
until
his
destiny
is
revealed
to
him

th
this

let
me
die
with
mine
help
me
up
l
will
miss
our
conversations
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
of
america
the
signing
of
this
treaty
will
usher
in
an
era
of
unprecedented
prosperity
and
cooperation
between
our
two
great
nations
on
behalf
of
the
emperor
we
are
pleased
to
have
successfully
concluded
this
negotiation
highness

if
we
could
just
conclude
the
matter
at
hand
this
is
katsumotos
sword
he
would
have
wanted
you
to
have
it
that
the
strength
of
the
samurai
be
with
you
always
enlightened
one

we
all
weep
for
katsumoto

but
he
hoped
with
his
last
breath
that
you
would
remember
the
ancestors
who
held
this
sword
and
what
they
died
for
your
highness
you
were
with
him
at
the
end
emperor

this
man
fought
against
you
if
you
believe
me
to
be
your
enemy

command
me
and
l
will
gladly
take
my
life
l
have
dreamed
of
a
unified
japan
of
a
country
strong
and
independent
and
modern
and
now
we
have
railroads
and
cannon

western
clothing
we
cannot
forget
who
we
are
or
where
we
come
from
ambassador
swanbeck
l
have
concluded
that
your
treaty
is
not
in
the
best
interest
of
my
people
sir

if
l
may
so
sorry
but
you
may
not
this
is
an
outrage
enlightened
one

we
should
discuss
this
you
have
done
quite
enough
everything
l
have
done

l
have
done
for
my
country
then
you
will
not
mind
when
l
seize
your
familys
assets
and
present
them
as
my
gift
to
the
people
you
disgrace
me
lf
your
shame
is
too
unbearable
l
offer
you
this
sword
tell
me
how
he
died
l
will
tell
you
how
he
lived
and
so
the
days
of
the
samurai
had
ended
nations

like
men

it
is
sometimes
said

have
their
own
destiny
as
for
the
american
captain
no
one
knows
what
became
of
him
some
say
that
he
died
of
his
wounds
others

that
he
returned
to
his
own
country
but
i
like
to
think
he
may
have
at
last
found
some
small
measure
of
peace
that
we
all
seek
i
am
here
to
find
one
lost
soul
i
have
no
interest
in
tyrants
or
heroes
rather

i
prefer
the
lives
of
smaller
men
the
ones
left
behind
hello

serban

remember
me
so

let
me
ask
you
how
did
we

six
years
before

such
bust

a
r�tissoire
a
r�tissoire
well

now

thats
when
you
get
a
potential
suspect

you
wrap
him
up
in
a
bit
of
carpet
you
beat
seven
bells
of
shit
out
of
him

no
cuts

no
bruises
just
a
tiny
bit
of
internal
bleeding
but

then
again

you
already
knew
that

didnt
you

john
yes

i
believe
it
was
mentioned
in
the
complaint
serban
lodged
with
the
general
inspector
i
didnt
do
it

if
thats
what
youre
driving
at

john

acting
rather
cavalier
for
a
man
in
your
tenuous
position

fucking
it
right

get
one
thing
straight
i
know
when
someones
trying

sweat
me

to
my
fucking
face

get
the
fuck
out

believe
youre
guilty
of
nothing
more
than
a
certain
degree
of
moral
ambivalence

outpost
at
the
edge
of
the
holy
roman
empire

a
country
house
for
the
party
elite
back
in
the
days
of
the
communists
only
it
was
more
than
that

wasnt
it
it
was
also
an
informal
headquarters
for
the
secret
police
dani
i
could
use
some
light
down
here
im
gonna
give
you
exactly
ten
seconds
for

tell
me
what
were
doing
down
here
or
i
swear
to
you

im
gone
please
try
to
maintain
your
professional
detachment
the
past
is
speaking
to
us

seven
five
you
remember
that
day
there
was
a
man
in
a
pressed
black
suit

round
glasses

his
name
was
treptow
he
met
your
parents
in
the
waiting
room
your
parents

it
seems

had
been
identified
as
subversives
enemies
of
the
state
they
never
knew
why
they
were
accused
or
by
whom
but
at
that
moment
they
knew
they
would
never
see
each
other
again
what
they
couldnt
possibly
know
is
how
their
tiny

forgotten
lives
would
one
day
change
the
balance
of
the
universe
beginning
with
one
terrified
little
girl
your
mother
would
die
before
giving
up
her
youngest
the
little
girl
had
suffered
a
terrible
cut
to
her
face
but
it
was
that
very
injury
that
proved
her
salvation
since
it
allowed
the
nurse
to
remove
her
for
emergency
treatment
the
child
was
spirited
out
of
the
country
the
very
next
day
listed
as
an
orphan
for
the
benefit
of

needful
mothers
you
know
why
you
werent
exterminated
that
day
alongside
your
devoted
mother
and
father

dont
you
of
course
you
do
you
turned
them
in

no
but
you
cant
be
blamed

really
you
were
just
a
child

doing
as
you
were
taught
in
school
learning
to
spot
enemies
of
the
state
wherever
they
might
lurk
however
close
to
home
is
it
any
wonder
you
still
commit
routine
acts
of
torture
in
the
commission
of
your
daily
job
did
you
really
think
that

by
coming
back
here
after
the
communists
fell
all
this
would
simply
be
forgotten
it
must
have
been
ripped
from
your
mothers
hands
as
she
was
dragged
away
what
the
fucking
hell
were
those
things
i
told
you

the
past

what
youd
probably
call
them
ghosts
understand
this
house
does
not
give
up
its
dead

dani
the
atrocities
committed
here
will
echo
forever
inside
those
walls
thanks
for
coming
all
the
way
out
here

lon

i
just
didnt
know
who
else
to
call
the
night
that
father
constantin
died
god
rest
his
soul
well

he
had
a
book
in
his
hand

a
bible
but
there
was
writing
in
it
that
wasnt
part
of
the
regular
scripture
the
words
were
writing
themselves
allison

allison
a
double
allison

thats
rough
knock
yourself
out
all
the
way
to
the
back

the
end
of
revelations
you
dont
see
it

do
you
i
really
am
a
nut
case
its
not
that

what
is
it
then
i
think
im
going
to
faint
then
you
do
see
it
theres
a
school
of
thought

very
marginalized
but
its
been
around
for
centuries
lon

youre
oh

yeah
yeah

i
get
them
a
lot

its
nothing
anyway

the
thinking
goes
that
revelations
is
not
just
the
last
chapter
of
the
bible
its
still
incomplete
incomplete
how
awaiting
further
dictation
from
god
you
think
theres
supposed
to
be
this
book

ok
its
called
the
prophets
lexicon
whoever
is
chosen
to
carry
it

basically
basically
what
holds
the
fate
of
humanity
in
their
hands
no

it
is
not
me
dont
look
at
me
like
that
just

real
tourist

six
of
the
seven
photos

taken
from
the
last
few
years
and
the
other
this
one
is
a
real
nut
case
it
does
no
sense
to
me
its
from
the
securitate
files
right
here
in
bucharest

dated
in


november
it
cant

its
gotta
be
a
different
john
riegert
not
if
youre
looking
at
the
same
photo
im
looking
at
your
mother

weep
for
you

dani
not
then
but
she
weeps
for
you
now
you
can
hear
it
every
time
you
close
your
eyes

cant
you
tell
me
who
you
are
are
you
sure
thats
what
you
really
want
im
sorry

father
this
is
this
is
fucking
insane

why
should
i
believe
you
because
nothing
will
ever
make
sense
to
you
again
if
you
dont
i
need
your
help

dani
but
more
than
that

you
need
mine
like
you

we
have
fought
terrible
wars
over
its
meaning
and
just
like
you

we
have
created
divisions
among
ourselves
that
are
not
what
you
might
call
convenient
like
like
heaven
and
hell
yes

but
now
there
is
a
book
a
version
of
your
holy
bible
that
can
end
that
dispute
forever
its
not
yet
complete

but
when
it
is

whosoever
has
that
book
will
have
an
insurmountable
advantage
over
the
rest
of
us
hell
know
which
horse
to
bet
on
before
the
last
race
is
even
won
or
which
horse
to
kill
if
he
wants
a
different
outcome

right
spoken
like
an
angel
that
book
decides
the
future
for
us
all
and
youre
saying
that
my
sisters
got
this
book
right

and
where
did
she
get
it
she
was
the
choice
of
an
angel
named
simon
an
angel
named
simon
and
why
why
did
simon
choose
my
baby
sister
broken
people
make
the
best
pawns

dani
just
say
i
believe
just
half
of
what
youre
telling
me
how
do
i
know
what
side
youre
on
whether
youre
one
of
the
good
ones
or
one
of
the
fucking
bad
ones
look
around
look
at
yourself

dani
do
you
really
think
those
distinctions
still
apply
as
the
lesser
of
two
evils
derek

hey

its
allison
look

i
i
just
need
to
ask
you
a
question

ok

dead
of
an
overdose
in
the
next
three
hours
paying
his
way
to
heaven

were
there
that
night
at
the
church

just
the
one
right

what
we
got
we
got
a
man
a
few
witnesses
saw
him
in
a
caf�
toilet
shortly
before
the
last
victim
was
found
with
his
face
in
a
sink
and
without
his
heart
who
we
know
is
an
undertaker
who
is
missing
from
his
funeral
home
since
yesterday
afternoon

you
understand
me
no

no

i
dont
understand

it
doesnt

point
is

the
suspect
is
content
to
confess
to
killing
the
undertaker
and
get
this

hes
a
priest
this
thing
is
more
like
some
kind
of
a
cult
or
something
right

i
want
to
talk
to
him
now

hell
only
talk
to

a
waste

made
more
of
this
place
the
evil
that
bred
here

such
an
opportunity
and
you
let
it
slip
away
and

poor
little
head
case
and
a
police
officer
who
thinks

can
buy
salvation

the
money
he
rips
off
from
drug
dealers
and
you
wonder
why
i
deserted
you
you
remember
the
first
war
the
big
one
we
stood
on
those
ramparts
long
after
we
knew
our
cause
was
lost
together
we
beat
back
michaels
hordes
right
down
to
the
bitter
end
when
you
fell

i
fell
when
you
rose
up
in
that
lake
of
fire

i
was
right
there
by
your
side
still
defiant

still
proud

opposing
god
at
every
turn
i
loved
you
as
my
master
just
as
you
once
loved
yours
but
along
the
way

the
lines
got
blurred

didnt
they
well

there
were
no
more
rallying
cries

no
more
odes
of
vindication
no
more
black

no
more
white
just
endless

endless
shades
of
gray
what
happened
to
you
did
you
get
tired
or
just
bored

as
an
embassy
where
you
can
always
get
asylum
for
as
long
as
you
want
decades

eons
after
all

time
is
of
no
concern
to
a
little
angel
like

walk
away
free
and
clear
or
face

the
next
one

a
shrewd
judge
of
human
nature

still
here

cant
stay
outside
a
body
for
long
its
so
easy

a
son
of
a
bitch

never
needed
my
forgiveness

to
trust
me
i
mean

i
do

sir

i
hope
so
repatch
the
main
ac
to
the
hard
drives
and
stand
by
to
broadcast
still
cant
sleep
you
wanna
talk
theyre
just
dreams
if
youre
afraid
of
something
i
just
wish
i
wish
i
knew
what
im
supposed
to
do
i
just
wish
i
knew
shes
gonna
call

dont
worry
here
you
are
are
we
ready
to
go
were
already
late
these
geotherms
confirm
the
last
transmission
of
the
osiris
the
machines
are
digging
theyre
boring
from
the
surface
down
to
zion
mother
theyll
avoid
the
perimeter
defense
how
fast
are
they
moving
control
estimates
their
descent
at

meters
an
hour
how
deep
are
they
almost

meters
what
about
the
scans
from
the
osiris
they
cant
be
accurate
they
may
be

its
not
possible
thatd
mean
there
are
a
quartermillion
sentinels
thats
right

that
cant
be
why
not
a
sentinel
for
every
man

woman
and
child
in
zion
that
sounds
exactly
like
the
thinking
of
a
machine
to
me
morpheus

glad
you
could
join
us
niobe
my
apologies
to
all

but
as
you
are
undoubtedly
aware
its
become
difficult
to
locate
a
secure
broadcast
position
squiddies
got
our
best
spots

lines
are
crawling
with
them
and
if
niobes
right

in

hours
theres
gonna
be
a
quartermillion
more
what
are
we
gonna
do
were
gonna
do
what
commander
lock
ordered
well
evacuate
broadcast
level
and
return
to
zion
and
does
the
commander
have
a
plan
for
stopping

sentinels
a
strategy
is
still
being
formulated
im
sure
it
is
what
do
you
think
we
should
do

morpheus
we
should
proceed
as
ordered
what
is
it
however

i
must
ask
one
of
you
for
help
some
of
you
believe
as
i
believe

some
of
you
do
not

those
of
you
that
do
know
we
are
nearing
the
end
of
our
struggle
the
prophecy
will
be
fulfilled
soon

but
before
it
can
be
the
oracle
must
be
consulted
if
we
return
and
recharge
now
we
can
be
back
in

hours

well
before
the
machines
reach
this
depth
do
you
understand
what
youre
asking
i
am
asking
that
one
ship
remain
here
in
our
place
in
case
the
oracle
should
attempt
to
contact
us
bullshit

youre
asking
one
of
us
to
disobey
a
direct
order
thats
right

i
am

but
we
well
know
that
the
reason
most
of
us
are
here
is
because
of
our
affinity
for
disobedience
what
happens
when
you
get
back
to
zion
he
wont
goddamn
it

morpheus

you
aint
never
gonna
change

yeah

link
hey

you
know

next
year
im
old
enough
to
join
a
crew

right
ive
been
thinking
about
it

and
ive
made
my
decision
let
me
guess
i
want
to
join
the
nebuchadnezzar
morpheus
hasnt
filled
the
other
positions

except
for
you

link
im
sure
he
has
reasons
but
the
more
i
think
about
it

the
more
i
think
its
meant
to
be
you
know

its
fate
youre
the
reason
im
here

neo
i
told
you

you
found
me

i
didnt
find
you
i
know

but
you
got
me
out

you
saved
me
you
saved
yourself
morpheus

commander
lock
i
wasnt
aware
that
my
actions
required
any
explanation
you
were
given
an
order
you
asked
for
one
ship
to
remain
behind
i
would
have
stayed

but
i
needed
to
recharge
my
ship
so
you
admit
to
a
direct
contravention
of
your
duty
we
need
a
presence
inside
the
matrix
to
await
contact
from
the
oracle
i
dont
want
to
hear
that
shit
i
dont
care
about
oracles
or
prophecies
or
messiahs
i
care
about
one
thing
stopping
that
army
from
destroying
this
city
to
do
that
i
need
soldiers
to
obey
my
orders
with
all
due
respect

commander

there
is
only
one
way
to
save
our
city
neo

goddamn
it

morpheus
not
everyone
believes
what
you
believe
my
beliefs
do
not
require
them
to
theres
a
gathering
tonight

everyones
talking

a
lot
of
people
are
scared
no
one
remembers
the
last
time
so
many
ships
were
docked
something
big
is
happening

isnt
it
hey
were
not
allowed
to
say
anything

so
stop
asking
goddamn

its
good
to
be
home
im
recommending
that
you
be
removed
from
duty
that
is

of
course

your
prerogative

commander
if
it
were
up
to
me

you
wouldnt
set
foot
on
a
ship
for
the
rest
of
your
life
then
i
am
grateful
that
it
is
not
up
to
you
councillor
hamann

commander
captain

councillor
councils
asked
me
to
speak
tonight
at
the
temple
gathering
the
presence
of
the
fleet
the
people
must
be
told
what
is
happening
of
course

councillor
but
might
i
advise
a
level
of
discretion
concerning
specific
details
we
do
not
wish
to
start
a
panic

quite
right
a
panic
is
not
what
anyone
wants
what
about
you

captain
what
would
you
advise
the
truth

no
one
will
panic

because
there
is
nothing
to
fear
that
army
wont
reach
the
gates
of
zion
what
makes
you
so
sure
consider
what
we
have
seen

councillor
consider
that
in
the
past
six
months
we
have
freed
more
minds
than
in
six
years
this
attack
is
an
act
of
desperation
i
believe
very
soon
the
prophecy
will
be
fulfilled
and
this
war
will
end
i
hope
youre
right

captain
i
do
not
believe
it
to
be
a
matter
of
hope

councillor
it
is
simply
a
matter
of
time
my
stop
see
you
soon

too
soon

him

and
ill
tell
you
what
after
being
on
that
ship
and
seeing
neo

the
things

im
starting
to
believe
him
too
be
careful

link
please
be
careful
tonight

let
us
honor
these
men
and
women
these
are
our
soldiers

our
warriors
these
are
our
husbands
and
wives

our
brothers
and
sisters
our
children
let
us
remember
those
that
have
been
lost
and
let
us
give
thanks
for
those
that
have
been
found
and
who
stand
here
beside
us
now
i
would
like
someone
else
to
close
this
prayer
someone
who
hasnt
spoken
here
in
a
long
time
but
who
i
believe
has
something
to
say
that
we
all
need
to
hear
i
give
you
morpheus
zion
hear
me
it
is
true
what
many
of
you
have
heard
the
machines
have
gathered
an
army

and
as
i
speak
that
army
is
drawing
nearer
to
our
home
believe
me
when
i
say
we
have
a
difficult
time
ahead
of
us
but
if
we
are
to
be
prepared
for
it

we
must
first
shed
our
fear
of
it
i
stand
here
before
you
now
truthfully
unafraid
because
i
believe
something
you
do
not
i
stand
here
without
fear
because
i
remember
i
remember
that
i
am
here
not
because
of
the
path
that
lies
before
me
but
because
of
the
path
that
lies
behind
me
i
remember
that
for

years
we
have
fought
these
machines
i
remember
that
for

years
they
have
sent
their
armies
to
destroy
us
and
after
a
century
of
war

i
remember
that
which
matters
most
we
are
still
here
let
us
send
a
message
to
that
army
tonight

let
us
shake
this
cave
tonight

let
us
tremble
these
halls
of
earth

steel
and
stone
let
us
be
heard
from
red
core
to
black
sky
tonight

let
us
make
them
remember
this
is
zion
and
we
are
not
afraid
i
remember
you
used
to
dance
i
remember
you
were
pretty
good
there
are
some
things
in
this
world

captain
niobe
that
will
never
change
some
things
do
change
i
missed
you

i
can
tell
i
was
thinking

everyone
is
here
neo

what
is
it
its
okay

you
can
tell
me
trinity
i
cant
lose
you
youre
not
gonna
lose
me
im
never
letting
go
good
night

zion
sweet
dreams
you
all
right
ill
make
it
did
you
see
that
agent
ive
never
seen
anything
like
that
it
doesnt
matter

all
that
matters
is
this
you
first
oh

god

smith
will
suffice
thank
you

my
pleasure
care
for
some
company
councillor
hamann
i
dont
want
to
intrude
if
youd
prefer
to
be
alone
no

i
could
probably
use
some
company

good
so
could
i
its
nice
tonight
very
calm
it
feels
like
everyone
is
sleeping
very
peacefully
not
everyone
i
hate
sleeping

i
never
sleep
more
than
a
few
hours
i
figure
i
slept
the
first

years
of
my
life

now
im
making
up
for
it
what
about
you
i
just
havent
been
able
to
sleep
much
its
a
good
sign

of
what
that
you
are
in
fact
still
human
have
you
ever
been
to
the
engineering
level
i
love
to
walk
there
at
night

its
quite
amazing
would
you
like
to
see
it
sure
almost
no
one
comes
down
here

unless

of
course

theres
a
problem
thats
how
it
is
with
people

nobody
cares
how
it
works
as
long
as
it
works
i
like
it
down
here
i
like
to
be
reminded
this
city
survives
because
of
these
machines
interesting

isnt
it
the
power
to
give
life
and
the
power
to
end
it

we
have
the
same
power
yeah

i
suppose
we
do

but
sometimes
i
think
about
those
people
still
plugged
into
the
matrix
and
when
i
look
at
these
machines
i
cant
help
thinking
that

in
a
way

we
are
plugged
into
them
but
we
control
these
machines

they
dont
control
us
of
course
not

how
could
they
the
idea
is
pure
nonsense
but
it
does
make
one
wonder
just
what
is
control
if
we
wanted

we
could
shut
these
machines
down
of
course

thats
it

you
hit
it

thats
control

isnt
it
if
we
wanted

we
could
smash
them
to
bits
our
heat

our
air
so
we
need
machines
and
they
need
us

is
that
your
point

councillor
no

no
point
old
men
like
me
dont
bother
with
making
points

theres
no
point
is
that
why
there
are
no
young
men
on
the
council
good
point
why
dont
you
tell
me
whats
on
your
mind

councillor
there
is
so
much
in
this
world
that
i
do
not
understand
see
that
machine
it
has
something
to
do
with
recycling
our
water
supply
i
have
absolutely
no
idea
how
it
works
but
i
do
understand
the
reason
for
it
to
work
i
have
absolutely
no
idea
how
you
are
able
to
do
some
of
the
things
you
do
but
i
believe
theres
a
reason
for
that
as
well
i
only
hope
we
understand
that
reason
before
its
too
late
ballard

is
he
here
neo

its
from
the
oracle
morpheus
said
this
was
how
it
was
gonna
happen
i
dont
know

maybe
the
prophecys
true

maybe
its
not
all
i
know
is

that
ship
needs
an
operator
right
now

that
operators
me
i
know
zee
i
want
you
to
wear
it
you
know
i
dont
believe
in
this
stuff

but
i
do
its
always
brought
me
luck
maybe
itll
bring
me
you

im
coming
back
i
promise

no
matter
what
it
takes

im
coming
home
just
keep
it
with
you

please
neo
how
the
hell
bane
is
something
wrong
i
just
wanted
to
catch
you
to
say
well
see
you
neo
just
in
time
youre
gonna
see
the
oracle
theres
no
time
i
had
to
give
something
to
neo
a
gift
from
one
of
the
orphans
he
made
me
swear
to
get
it
to
you
before
you
left
he
said
youd
understand
i
was
just
told
you
cleared
the
nebuchadnezzar
for
takeoff
that
is
correct
am
i
still
in
charge
of
our
defense
system
i
believe
i
need
every
ship
we
have
if
were
going
to
survive
this
attack
i
understand
that

commander
then
why
did
you
allow
the
nebuchadnezzar
to
leave
because
i
believe
our
survival
depends
on
more
than
how
many
ships
we
have
you
seek
the
oracle

who
are
you
i
am
seraph

i
can
take
you
to
her

but
first
i
must
apologize
apologize
for
what
for
this
the
oracle
has
many
enemies

i
had
to
be
sure
of
what
that
you
are
the
one
you
could
have
just
asked

no

you
do
not
truly
know
someone
until
you
fight
them
come

shes
waiting
where
the
hell
did
they
go
these
are
back
doors

arent
they
programmer
access
how
do
they
work
a
code
is
hidden
in
tumblers
one
position
opens
a
lock
and
another
position
opens
one
of
these
doors
are
you
a
programmer
then
what
are
you
i
protect
that
which
matters
most
well

come
on

i
aint
gonna
bite
you
come
around
here
and
let
me
have
a
look
at
you
my
goodness

look
at
you
you
turned
out
all
right

didnt
you
how
do
you
feel
i
i
know
youre
not
sleeping

well
get
to
that
why
dont
you
come
and
have
a
sit
this
time
maybe
ill
stand

well

suit
yourself
i
felt
like
sitting

i
know
lets
get
the
obvious
stuff
out
of
the
way
youre
not
human

are
you
if
i
had
to
guess

id
say
youre
a
program
from
the
machine
world
so
is
he

so
far

so
good
but
if
thats
true

that
could
mean
youre
part
of
this
system
another
kind
of
control
keep
going
how
can
i
trust
you
bingo
it
is
a
pickle

no
doubt
about
it

bad
news
is
theres
no
way
you
can
really
know
if
im
here
to
help
you
or
not
so
its
really
up
to
you

just
have
to
make
up
your
own
damn
mind
to
either
accept
what
im
going
to
tell
you
or
reject
it
but
if
you
already
know

how
can
i
make
a
choice
because
you
didnt
come
here
to
make
the
choice

youve
already
made
it
youre
here
to
try
to
understand
why
you
made
it
i
thought
youd
have
figured
that
out
by
now
why
are
you
here
same
reason
i
love
candy
but
why
help
us
were
all
here
to
do
what
were
all
here
to
do
im
interested
in
one
thing

neo
the
future
and
believe
me

i
know

the
only
way
to
get
there
is
together
are
there
other
programs
like
you
well

not
like
me

but
look

see
those
birds
at
some
point

a
program
was
written
to
govern
them
a
program
was
written
to
watch
over
the
trees
and
the
wind
there
are
programs
running
all
over
the
place
the
ones
doing
their
job

doing
what
they
were
meant
to
do

are
invisible
youd
never
even
know
they
were
here

but
the
other
ones
well

you
hear
about
them
all
the
time
ive
never
heard
of
them

of
course
you
have
every
time
youve
heard
someone
say
they
saw
a
ghost
or
an
angel
every
story
youve
ever
heard
about
vampires

werewolves
or
aliens
is
the
system
assimilating
some
program
thats
doing
something
theyre
not
supposed
to
be
doing
programs
hacking
programs
why
they
have
their
reasons
but
usually
a
program
chooses
exile
when
it
faces
deletion
and
why
would
a
program
be
deleted
maybe
it
breaks
down
maybe
a
better
program
is
created
to
replace
it

happens
all
the
time
and
when
it
does

a
program
can
either
choose
to
hide
here
or
return
to
the
source
the
machine
mainframe

yes
where
you
must
go
where
the
path
of
the
one
ends

youve
seen
it
in
your
dreams

havent
you
a
door
made
of
light
what
happens
when
you
go
through
the
door
i
see
trinity
and
something
happens
something
bad
she
starts
to
fall

and
then
i
wake
up
do
you
see
her
die
no
you
have
the
sight
now

neo
you
are
looking
at
the
world
without
time
then
why
cant
i
see
what
happens
to
her
we
can
never
see
past
the
choices
we
dont
understand
are
you
saying
i
have
to
choose
whether
trinity
lives
or
dies
no

youve
already
made
the
choice
now
you
have
to
understand
it
i
cant
do
that

i
wont
well

you
have
to

why
because
youre
the
one
what
if
i
cant
what
happens
if
i
fail
then
zion
will
fall
our
time
is
up

listen
to
me

neo

you
can
save
zion
if
you
reach
the
source

but
to
do
that
you
need
the
keymaker
the
keymaker
yes

he
disappeared

we
didnt
know
what
happened
to
him
until
now
hes
being
held
prisoner
by
a
very
dangerous
program
one
of
the
oldest
of
us

he
is
called
the
merovingian
and
he
wont
let
him
go
willingly

what
does
he
want
what
do
all
men
with
power
want
more
power
be
there
at
that
exact
time
and
you
will
have
a
chance
seems
like
every
time
we
meet
i
got
nothing
but
bad
news
im
sorry
about
that

i
surely
am
but
for
what
its
worth
youve
made
a
believer
out
of
me
good
luck

kiddo
mr

anderson
did
you
get
my
package
smith
hes
not
reading
like
an
agent
surprised
to
see
me
no
then
youre
aware
of
it

of
what
our
connection
i
dont
fully
understand
how
it
happened
perhaps
some
part
of
you
imprinted
onto
me
something
overwritten
or
copied
it
is

at
this
point

irrelevant

what
matters
is
that
whatever
happened

happened
for
a
reason
and
what
reason
is
that
i
killed
you

mr

anderson

i
watched
you
die
with
a
certain
satisfaction

i
might
add
and
then
something
happened

something
that
i
knew
was
impossible
but
it
happened
anyway
you
destroyed
me

mr

anderson
afterward

i
knew
the
rules

i
understood
what
i
was
supposed
to
do
but
i
didnt
i
couldnt

i
was
compelled
to
stay
compelled
to
disobey
and
now

here
i
stand
because
of
you

mr

anderson
because
of
you

im
no
longer
an
agent
of
this
system
because
of
you

ive
changed

im
unplugged
a
new
man

so
to
speak

like
you

apparently
free
congratulations
but
as
you
well
know

appearances
can
be
deceiving
which
brings
me
back
to
the
reason
why
were
here
were
not
here
because
were
free

were
here
because
we
are
not
free
theres
no
escaping
reason

no
denying
purpose
because
as
we
both
know

without
purpose
we
would
not
exist

it
is
purpose
that
created
us
purpose
that
connects
us

purpose
that
pulls
us
that
guides
us

that
drives
us
it
is
purpose
that
defines

purpose
that
binds
us
we
are
here
because
of
you

mr

anderson
were
here
to
take
from
you
what
you
tried
to
take
from
us
whats
happening
to
him
dont
know
yes

thats
it

itll
be
over
soon
you

yes

me
me

me

me
me
too
it
is
inevitable
come
on

get
out
of
there
it
was
smith

yes
now
theres
more
than
one
of
them
a
lot
more
how
is
that
possible
i
dont
know
somehow

hes
found
a
way
to
copy
himself
is
that
what
he
was
doing
to
you
i
dont
know
what
he
was
doing
but
i
know
what
it
felt
like

what
it
felt
like
i
was
back
in
that
hallway
it
felt
like
dying
the
machines
are
tunneling
to
avoid
our
defense
system
but
i
believe
they
will
intersect
certain
pipelines
to
control
them
these
points
of
intersection
are
crucial
because
i
believe
theyre
vulnerable
to
counterattack
although
it
has
been
suggested
that
this
is
the
same
kind
of
attack
weve
defended
for
years

i
urge
the
council
to
realize
the
truth
this
is
the
single
greatest
threat
we
have
ever
faced
and
if
we
do
not
act
accordingly

we
will
not
survive
commander
lock

the
council
is
well
aware
of
the
seriousness
of
this
attack
you
have
our
leave
to
prepare
our
defense
by
any
and
all
means
necessary
thank
you

council

however
we
ask
if
theres
been
word
from
the
nebuchadnezzar
no

councillor

no
word

nothing
then
we
request
a
ship
be
dispatched
to
ascertain
the
fate
of
the
one
i
wish
that
were
possible

councillor

but
i
do
not
believe
our
defense
can
suffer
the
loss
of
another
ship

it
will

commander

if
it
must
it
could
take
one
ship
days
to
find
the
nebuchadnezzar
then
send
two

this
is
insane
careful

commander
forgive
my
frustration

councillors
but
i
wish
i
were
able
to
comprehend
the
councils
choice
in
this
matter
comprehension
is
not
a
requisite
of
cooperation
if
you
are
asking
me
to
order
two
of
my
captains
theres
no
need
for
such
an
order
the
captains
are
present

they
can
answer
for
themselves
the
council
is
calling
for
two
volunteers
to
aid
the
nebuchadnezzar
are
there
two
among
you
that
would
answer
such
a
call
captain
soren
of
the
vigilant
will
answer
the
councils
call
you
understand
the
situation

captain
soren
yes

maam

thank
you

captain
is
there
another
captain

i
think
we
should
volunteer

what
you
have
gone
crazy
listen
shut
your
hole

bane
before
i
put
you
in
one
is
there
no
other
be
hard
for
any
man
to
risk
his
life
especially
if
he
doesnt
understand
the
reason
captain
niobe
of
the
logos
will
answer
the
councillors
call
what
thank
you

captain
niobe
commander
lock

you
have
your
orders

this
council
is
hereby
adjourned
niobe

what
are
you
doing
what
i
can
because
some
things
never
change

jason
and
some
things
do
what
can
you
see

neo
its
strange

the
code
is
somehow
different
encrypted
maybe
is
that
good
for
us
or
bad
for
us
well

it
looks
like
every
floor
is
wired
with
explosives
bad
for
us
yes

we
are
here
to
speak
with
the
merovingian
well

of
course

he
has
been
expecting
you
follow
me
here
he
is
at
last

neo

the
one
himself
and
the
legendary
morpheus
and
trinity

of
course

i
have
heard
so
much
you
honor
me

please

sit

join
us

this
is
my
wife

persephone
something
to
eat
drink
of
course

such
things
are
contrivances

like
so
much
here
for
the
sake
of
appearances
no

thank
you

yes

of
course

who
has
time
ch�teau
hautbriond



magnificent
wine
i
love
french
wine
like
i
love
the
french
language
i
have
sampled
every
language

french
is
my
favorite

fantastic
language
especially
to
curse
with
you
see
its
like
wiping
your
ass
with
silk

i
love
it
you
know
why
we
are
here
i
am
a
trafficker
of
information

i
know
everything
i
can
the
question
is

do
you
know
why
you
are
here
we
are
looking
for
the
keymaker
oh

yes

it
is
true

the
keymaker

of
course
but
this
is
not
a
reason

this
is
not
a
why
the
keymaker
himself

his
very
nature

is
a
means

it
is
not
an
end
and
so
to
look
for
him
is
to
be
looking
for
a
means
to
do
what
you
know
the
answer
to
that
question
but
do
you
you
think
you
do

but
you
do
not
you
are
here
because
you
were
sent
here
you
were
told
to
come
here

and
then
you
obeyed
it
is

of
course

the
way
of
all
things
you
see

there
is
only
one
constant
one
universal

it
is
the
only
real
truth
causality
action

reaction
cause
and
effect

everything
begins
with
choice
no

wrong
choice
is
an
illusion
created
between
those
with
power
and
those
without
look
there
at
that
woman
my
god

just
look
at
her
affecting
everyone
around
her
so
obvious

so
bourgeois

so
boring

but
wait
watch

you
see

i
have
sent
her
a
dessert
a
very
special
dessert
i
wrote
it
myself
it
starts
so
simply
each
line
of
the
program
creating
a
new
effect

just
like
poetry
first
a
rush

heat

her
heart
flutters
you
can
see
it

neo

yes
she
does
not
understand
why
is
it
the
wine
no
what
is
it
then
what
is
the
reason
and
soon
it
does
not
matter
soon
the
why
and
the
reason
are
gone
and
all
that
matters
is
the
feeling
itself
and
this
is
the
nature
of
the
universe
we
struggle
against
it

we
fight
to
deny
it
but
it
is

of
course

pretense

it
is
a
lie
beneath
our
poised
appearance
out
of
control
causality

there
is
no
escape
from
it

we
are
forever
slaves
to
it
our
only
hope

our
only
peace

is
to
understand
it

to
understand
the
why
why
is
what
separates
us
from
them
you
from
me
why
is
the
only
real
source
of
power

without
it

you
are
powerless
and
this
is
how
you
come
to
me

without
why

without
power
another
link
in
the
chain
but
fear
not
since
i
have
seen
how
good
you
are
at
following
orders
i
will
tell
you
what
to
do
next
run
back
and
give
the
fortuneteller
this
message
her
time
is
almost
up
now
i
have
some
real
business
to
do

so
i
will
say
adieu
and
goodbye
this
isnt
over

oh

yes

it
is
the
keymaker
is
mine

and
i
see
no
reason
why
i
should
give
him
up
no
reason
at
all

where
are
you
going
please

ma
cherie

i
have
told
you

we
are
all
victims
of
causality
i
drank
too
much
wine

i
must
take
a
piss
cause
and
effect

au
revoir
touch
me
and
that
hand
will
never
touch
anything
again
well

that
didnt
go
so
well
are
you
certain
the
oracle
didnt
say
anything
else
yes

maybe
we
did
something
wrong
or
didnt
do
something
no

what
happened
couldnt
have
happened
any
other
way
how
do
you
know
we
are
still
alive
if
you
want
the
keymaker

follow
me
i
am
so
sick
and
tired
of
his
bullshit

on
and
on

pompous
prick
a
long
time
ago

when
we
first
came
here

it
was
so
different
he
was
so
different
he
was
like
you
ill
give
you
what
you
want

but
you
have
to
give
me
something
what
a
kiss
i
want
you
to
kiss
me
as
if
you
were
kissing
her
why
you
love
her

she
loves
you
its
all
over
you
both
a
long
time
ago

i
knew
what
that
felt
like
i
want
to
remember
it

i
want
to
sample
it

thats
all
just
a
sample
why
dont
you
sample
this
instead
trinity
such
emotion
over
something
so
small

its
just
a
kiss
why
should
we
trust
you
if
i
dont
deliver
you
to
the
keymaker

she
can
kill
me
but
you
have
to
make
me
believe
i
am
her
terrible

forget
it
i
envy
you

but
such
a
thing
is
not
meant
to
last
come
with
me
not
again
its
all
right

boys

with
me
these
fellas
work
for
my
husband
they
do
his
dirty
work

theyre
very
good

very
loyal
arent
you

boys
they
come
from
a
much
older
version
of
the
matrix
but
like
so
many
back
then

they
caused
more
problems
than
they
solved
my
husband
saved
them
because
theyre
notoriously
difficult
to
terminate
how
many
people
keep
silver
bullets
in
their
gun
you
can
either
run
and
tell
my
husband
what
i
have
done
or
you
can
stay
there
and
die
hes
in
the
ladies
room

you
are
no

necessary
we
do
only
what
were
meant
to
do
then
you
are
meant
for
one
more
thing
deletion
go
kick
his
ass
neo

if
youre
out
there

i
could
use
some
help
what
is
that
sir

we
have
confirmation
from
the
icarus
first
two
ships
are
in
position
for
counterattack
any
change
they
hit
some
iron
ore
here

slowed
them
down
a
little
how
much
an
hour

maybe
that
would
give
them
a
little
over
nine
hours
there
is
a
building
inside
this
building

there
is
a
level
where
no
elevator
can
go
and
no
stair
can
reach
this
level
is
filled
with
doors

these
doors
lead
to
many
places
hidden
places
but
one
door
is
special
one
door
leads
to
the
source
this
building
is
protected
by
a
very
secure
system
every
alarm
triggers
the
bomb

bomb
did
he
say
bomb
but
like
all
systems

it
has
a
weakness
the
system
is
based
on
the
rules
of
a
building
one
system
built
on
another

electricity
if
one
fails

so
must
the
other

no
electricity

no
alarms
youd
have
to
take
out
a
city
block
to
kill
the
power
not
one



twentyseven
blocks
there
is
a
power
station
it
must
be
destroyed
there
must
be
some
kind
of
failsafe

yes

there
is
an
emergency
system
the
core
network
of
the
grid
must
be
accessed
the
emergency
system
must
be
deactivated
what
do
you
need
us
for
neo
could
take
them
out
easier
than
we
could
theres
no
time

why
once
the
door
is
unprotected

the
connection
will
be
severed
but
another
connection
must
first
be
made
how
long
will
that
take
exactly

seconds
just
over
five
minutes
that
is
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
window
only
the
one
can
open
the
door
and
only
during
that
window
can
the
door
be
opened
how
do
you
know
all
this
i
know
because
i
must
know

it
is
my
purpose
its
the
reason
im
here

the
same
reason
were
all
here
neo

i
know
somethings
wrong
you
dont
have
to
tell
me
i
just
want
you
to
know
that
im
here
all
must
be
done
as
one
cant
hurt
if
one
fails
all
fail
at
midnight

there
is
a
shift
change
in
the
security
of
both
buildings
at
midnight

we
will
strike
hey
you
count
sheep
at
home

why
i
get
paid
to
count
them
here
okay

theyre
inside
how
much
time
twelve
minutes
oh

shit
all
of
our
lives

we
have
fought
this
war

tonight

i
believe
we
can
end
it
tonight
is
not
an
accident
there
are
no
accidents
we
have
not
come
here
by
chance

i
do
not
believe
in
chance
when
i
see
three
objectives

three
captains

three
ships
i
do
not
see
coincidence

i
see
providence
i
see
purpose
i
believe
it
is
our
fate
to
be
here

it
is
our
destiny
i
believe
this
night
holds
for
each
and
every
one
of
us
the
very
meaning
of
our
lives
i
want
to
ask
you
to
do
something

but
i
dont
know
how
i
promise
you

if
i
can

i
will
what
if
i
asked
you
to
stay
out
of
this
no
matter
what
to
stay
out
of
the
matrix
please
what
is
it

niobe
i
cant
help
it

morpheus

i
cant
help
thinking

what
if
youre
wrong
what
if
all
this

the
prophecy

everything

is
bullshit
then
tomorrow
we
may
all
be
dead
but
how
would
that
be
different
from
any
other
day
this
is
a
war

and
we
are
soldiers
death
can
come
for
us
at
any
time
incoming

incoming
now
consider
the
alternative
what
if
i
am
right
what
if
the
prophecy
is
true
what
if
tomorrow
the
war
could
be
over
isnt
that
worth
fighting
for
isnt
that
worth
dying
for
time
three
minutes
it
is
done
find
the
others
i
got
niobe
there

theyre
out
of
the
station
what
about
soren
there
theyre
still
inside

but
theyre
not
moving
thats
it

lets
go
call
neo
now
i
lost
them

theyre
inside
the
portal

what
about
the
grid
everything
is
operational

the
emergency
system
is
rerouting
power
soon
as
they
open
that
door

its
all
over
the
hell
it
is
what
are
you
trinity
i
will
not
wait
and
do
nothing

i
will
not
watch
them
die
were
talking
less
than
five
minutes
in
five
minutes

ill
tear
that
building
down
how
much
further
here

just
here
im
sorry

this
is
a
dead
end
its
gotta
be
the
ugliest
hack
i
have
ever
done
thats
as
close
as
i
can
get
you

you
better
grow
wings
operator

im
in
keep
moving

sixtyfifth
floor
you
look
surprised
to
see
me
again

mr

anderson
well

thats
the
difference
between
us

i
have
been
expecting
you
what
do
you
want

smith
you
havent
figured
that
out
still
using
all
the
muscles
except
the
one
that
matters
i
want
exactly
what
you
want
i
want
everything
would
that
include
a
bullet
from
this
gun
go
ahead

shoot
the
best
thing
about
being
me

theres
so
many
mes
christ
what
the
hell
happened
in
here
hold
it
right
there

little
lady
if
you
cant
beat
us
join
us
still
no
sight
of
them

they
only
got
two
minutes
left
one
minute
kill
them
theyre
in
it
was
meant
to
be
morpheus

that
door
will
take
you
home
you
will
know
which
door

hurry

neo
trinity

i
got
some
serious
activity
headed
your
way
hello

neo
who
are
you
i
am
the
architect
i
created
the
matrix

ive
been
waiting
for
you
you
remain
irrevocably
human
ergo

some
of
my
answers
you
will
understand
and
some
you
will
not
concordantly

while
your
first
question
may
be
the
most
pertinent
you
may
or
may
not
realize
it
is
also
the
most
irrelevant
why
am
i
here
your
life
is
the
sum
of
a
remainder
of
an
unbalanced
equation
inherent
to
the
programming
of
the
matrix
you
are
the
eventuality
of
an
anomaly

which
despite
my
sincerest
efforts
ive
been
unable
to
eliminate
from
what
is
otherwise
while
it
remains
a
burden
assiduously
avoided
it
is
not
unexpected
and
thus
not
beyond
a
measure
of
control
which
has
led
you

inexorably
you
havent
answered
my
question

quite
right
interesting

that
was
quicker
than
the
others
others
how
many
what
others
the
matrix
is
older
than
you
know
i
count
from
the
emergence
of
one
integral
anomaly
five
before
me
hes
lying

bullshit
there
are
only
two
possible
explanations

there
were
five
before
me
either
no
one
told
me
or
no
one
knows

precisely
as
you
are
undoubtedly
gathering

the
anomaly
is
systemic
creating
fluctuations
in
even
the
most
simplistic
equations
you
cant
control
me
im
gonna
smash
you
to
bits
im
gonna
fucking
kill
you
you
cant
make
me
do
anything

you
old

white
prick
choice
the
problem
is
choice
the
first
matrix
i
designed
was
naturally
perfect

a
work
of
art
flawless

sublime
a
triumph
equaled
only
by
its
monumental
failure
the
inevitability
of
its
doom
is
apparent
now
as
a
consequence
of
the
imperfection
inherent
in
every
human
thus

i
redesigned
it
based
on
your
history
to
more
accurately
reflect
the
varying
grotesqueries
of
your
nature
however

i
was
again
frustrated
by
failure
i
have
come
to
understand
that
the
answer
eluded
me
because
it
required
a
lesser
mind
or
perhaps

a
mind
less
bound
by
the
parameters
of
perfection
thus

the
answer
was
stumbled
upon
by
another

an
intuitive
program
initially
created
to
investigate
certain
aspects
of
the
human
psyche
if
i
am
the
father
of
the
matrix

she
would
undoubtedly
be
its
mother
the
oracle

please
as
i
was
saying

she
stumbled
upon
a
solution
accepted
the
program

as
long
as
they
were
given
a
choice
even
if
they
were
only
aware
of
the
choice
at
a
near
unconscious
level
while
this
answer
functioned

it
was
fundamentally
flawed
thus
creating
the
otherwise
contradictory
systemic
anomaly
that

if
left
unchecked

might
threaten
the
system
ergo

those
that
refused
the
program

while
a
minority

if
unchecked
would
constitute
an
escalating
probability
of
disaster
this
is
about
zion
you
are
here
because
zion
is
about
to
be
destroyed
its
every
living
inhabitant
terminated

its
entire
existence
eradicated
denial
is
the
most
predictable
of
all
human
responses
but
rest
assured

this
will
be
the
sixth
time
we
have
destroyed
it
and
we
have
become
exceedingly
efficient
at
it
the
function
of
the
one
is
now
to
return
to
the
source

allowing
a
dissemination
after
which
you
will
be
required
to
select
from
the
matrix

individuals
sixteen
female

seven
male

to
rebuild
zion
failure
to
comply
with
this
process
will
result
in
a
cataclysmic
system
crash
killing
everyone
connected
to
the
matrix
which

coupled
with
the
extermination
of
zion
will
result
in
the
extinction
of
the
entire
human
race
you
wont
let
it
happen

you
cant

you
need
human
beings
to
survive
there
are
levels
of
survival
we
are
prepared
to
accept
the
relevant
issue
is
whether
or
not
you
are
ready
to
accept
responsibility
for
the
death
of
every
human
being
in
this
world
it
is
interesting
reading
your
reactions
your
five
predecessors
were

by
design

based
on
a
similar
predication
a
contingent
affirmation
to
the
rest
of
your
species

facilitating
the
function
of
the
one
while
the
others
experience
this
in
a
general
way
your
experience
is
far
more
specific
visavis
love
apropos

she
entered
the
matrix
to
save
your
life
at
the
cost
of
her
own
which
brings
us
at
last
to
the
moment
of
truth

wherein
the
fundamental
flaw
is
ultimately
expressed
and
the
anomaly
revealed
as
both
beginning
and
end
there
are
two
doors
the
door
to
your
right
leads
to
the
source
and
the
salvation
of
zion
the
door
to
your
left
leads
back
to
the
matrix

to
her
as
you
adequately
put

the
problem
is
choice
but
we
already
know
what
you
are
going
to
do

dont
we
already
i
can
see
the
chain
reaction

the
chemical
precursors
that
signal
an
emotion
that
is
already
blinding
you
from
the
simple
and
obvious
truth
she
is
going
to
die
and
there
is
nothing
you
can
do
to
stop
it
hope

it
is
the
quintessential
human
delusion

simultaneously
the
source
of
your
greatest
strength
and
your
greatest
weakness
if
i
were
you

i
would
hope
that
we
dont
meet
again
we
wont
we
got
a
serious
situation

sir
what
was
that
its
moving
faster
holy
shit

he
caught
her
neo

i
had
to
the
bullet
is
still
inside
i
know
you
can
hear
me
im
not
letting
go
i
cant
i
love
you
too
damn
much
i
cant
take
this
i
guess
this
makes
us
even
i
dont
understand
it
everything
was
done
as
it
was
supposed
to
be
done
once
the
one
reaches
the
source

the
war
should
be
over
in

hours

it
will
be

what
if
we
dont
do
something
in

hours

zion
will
be
destroyed
what
how
do
you
know
that
i
was
told
it
would
happen

by
whom
it
doesnt
matter

i
believed
him
impossible

the
prophecy
tells
us
it
was
a
lie

morpheus
the
prophecy
was
a
lie
the
one
was
never
meant
to
end
anything
it
was
all
another
system
of
control
i
dont
believe
that
but
you
said
it
yourself
how
can
the
prophecy
be
true
if
the
war
isnt
over
i
know
it
isnt
easy
to
hear

but
i
swear
to
you
its
the
truth
what
are
we
gonna
do
i
dont
know
oh

no
what
are
they
doing
theyre
just
out
of
emp
range
its
a
bomb
we
have
to
get
out
of
here

now
i
have
dreamed
a
dream
but
now
that
dream
has
gone
from
me
here
they
come
lets
go

morpheus
we
wont
make
it

we
have
to
try
come
on
somethings
different
i
can
feel
them
what
happened
i
dont
know
its
the
hammer
hes
in
some
kind
of
coma
what
about
you
you
could
use
some
rest
no

im
gonna
stay
with
him
lock
was
right

he
guessed
that
the
machines
would
cut
off
the
mainlines
in
and
out
of
zion
he
thought
a
counterattack
might
surprise
them
it
sounded
good

i
figured
we
had
a
shot
until
someone
screwed
it
up
an
emp
was
triggered
before
we
got
in
position
five
ships
were
instantly
downed

when
the
machines
broke
through
it
wasnt
a
battle

it
was
a
slaughter
was
it
an
accident
some
sort
of
malfunction
no
one
knows

someone
does
once
the
machines
were
done
with
us

they
started
digging
again
we
made
a
quick
pass
to
look
for
survivors
you
found
one
everything
that
has
a
beginning
has
an
end
i
see
the
end
coming
i
see
the
darkness
spreading
mr

anderson

welcome
back
we
missed
you
it
ends
tonight
and
you
are
all
that
stands
in
his
way
if
you
cannot

all
this
to
punish
me
maybe
i

maybe
its
over
there
you
gotta
come

the
money
hooker
he
kept
us
like
slaves
if
we
didnt
bring
the
sum
he
expected
hed
hang
us
naked
upside
down
and
pee
on
us
and
the
gifts
the
times
i
got
pregnant
it
was
his
way
of
treating
me
nice
perfume

cellphones

shoes
and
at
the
end

or

euros
when
the
deal
was
closed
did
you
know
the
people
these
deals
were
made
with
no

from
the
fourth
month
i
was
locked
in
i
didnt
see
anybody

he
did
everything
explain
that

mold
would
procure
the
buyers
the
first
time
i
got
pregnant
by
chance
and
he
found
them
at
the
eighth
month
after
that

it
was
always
organized
meaning
the
buyers
chose
one
of
us
then

the
chosen
girl
took
no
more
precautions
and
got
pregnant

how
many
times
were
you
nine
nine
babies
in
twelve
years
the
last
one
is
tea
adacher
push
try
again

push
good
come
on
good

this
way
here
it
comes
here
good

you
did
well
show
me
the
baby

show
me
the
baby
ill
take
it
show
me
the
baby
and
forget
it
how
can
you
be
so
sure
tea
adacher
is
your
daughter
her
birth
date
is
three
days
after
my
delivery
usually
it
takes
longer
to
register
them
thats
not
sufficient
proof
no
one
ever
saw
mrs

adacher
during
the
pregnancy
theres
not
one
picture
of
her
with
a
belly
every
mother
has
one
nor
the
analyses
you
do
when
youre
expecting
absurd

isnt
it
tea
doesnt
look
like
either
of
her
parents
in
fact
shes
their
adopted
daughter

what
makes
you
sure
i
saw
the
adoption
certificate

they
kept
it
in
the
safe
tell
the
judge
what
your
feelings
were
towards
the
adachers
i
loved
them

theyd
given
my
daughter
the
future
that
i
never
could
have
how
did
you
find
the
adachers
in
velarchi
there
are

adacher
families
but
they
were
the
only
ones
with
a
child
of
that
age
was
adacher
the
obstetrician
told
me
genna
lucrezia

do
you
know
yaroshenko
irena
they
called
her
giorgia

right
did
you
tell
the
judge
yes

i
know
her

mh
theres
a
contradiction
in
the
statements
of
you
both
you
saw
those
who
chose
and
took
the
children
i
didnt
see
anyone
i
dont
know
about
any
babies
youre
sick
we
were
at
your
house
you
were
cooking
eggplant

you
said
adacher

in
velarchi
i
cant
cook
eggplant

in
your
statement
you
say
adacher
how
did
you
come
to
know
this
name
she
badgered

wanting
to
know
things
i
didnt
know
she
was
unbearable

she
wanted
me
to
convince
mold
to
talk
i
went
one
day
give
that
bitch
the
name
i
dont
know
the
name
i
need
an
original
name
adacher
say
adacher
in
velarchi
so
thats
what
i
told
you
cant
be

she
just
wants
revenge
your
decision
to
collaborate
was
useful
but
im
afraid
lots
of
things
cant
be
overlooked
i
reached
my
goal

the
rest
doesnt
matter
you
all
were
great
id
like
to
ask
a
question
by
now
you
know
all
about
me

go
ahead
didnt
you
ever
think
about
finding
your
children
the
others
too
no

just
the
last
one
how
come
i
dont
know
maybe
because
i
knew
who
the
father
was
lately
however
ive
been
thinking
of
the
others
too
all
i
knows
their
age

i
make
up
the
rest
if
i
hadnt
found
tea

maybe
id
have
looked
for
them
too
i
have
something
to
tell
you
also
the
dna
shows
that
tea
is
not
your
daughter
that
document
was
only
a
request
for
fosterage
you
should
have
noticed
the
childs
name
was
missing
its
a
fully
legal
adoption
the
natural
mother
disappeared
after
delivery
the
judge
has
asked
me
to
make
you
a
very
particular
proposal
youve
no
obligation
to
say
yes
dont
you
know
me
are
you
mad
at
me
i
had
to
go
to
my
country

far
away
you
take
trips
too

youre
not
a
good
nanny
before
youd
have
asked
my
mothers
permission
im
getting
old

i
forget
things
next
time
ask
me

sure

madame
president
i
went
down

this
time
i
dont
know
who
to
beat
up
is
that
why
you
dont
want
to
eat
when
you
fall
and
you
dont
know
who
pushed
you
take
it
out
on
the
first
you
meet

but
never
on
yourself
this
time
you
didnt
bring
me
a
present
thats
true

but
i
worked
to
get
you
one
thats
very
big
its
a
secret
for
now

but
in
a
while
youll
be
really
surprised
how
long
youll
be
a
grown

beautiful
girl
is
it
possible
to
wait
so
long
sure

important
things
take
lots
of
patience
so

you
have
to
eat
to
grow
up
you
wont
need
a
nanny
to
help
you
eat
to
pick
your
clothes
out
in
the
morning

youll
do
everything
by
yourself
are
you
saying
you
wont
stay
with
me
a
maid
is
never
forever

sooner
or
later
she
leaves
or
gets
fired
i
havent
fired
you
i
know

but
i
had
to
take
another
job
give
it
up
or
find
a
way
to
get
fired
thats
hard

it
isnt
a
job
like
the
others
if
you
hurry
and
learn
to
write

well
exchange
lots
of
letters
and
youll
tell
me
how
it
feels
to
become
a
woman
you
should
know
i
was
too
distracted
in
my
life
i
didnt
even
realize
so
the
things
you
taught
me
are
things
you
made
up
sometimes

you
grownups
cant
be
trusted
are
you
ill
no
ill
do
it
myself
ive
given
up
you

romantic
hero

when
she
came
here

he

youre
a
liar

so
this
is
a
story
about
a
man
named
harold
crick
and
his
wristwatch
harold
crick
was
a
man
of
infinite
numbers
endless
calculations
and
remarkably
few
words
and
his
wristwatch
said
even
less
every
weekday

for

years
harold
would
brush
each
of
his

teeth

times
thirtyeight
times
back
and
forth
thirtyeight
times
up
and
down
harold
would
tie
his
tie
in
a
single
windsor
knot
instead
of
the
double
thereby
saving
up
to

seconds
his
wristwatch
thought
the
single
windsor
made
his
neck
look
fat
but
said
nothing
harold
would
run
at
a
rate
of
nearly

steps
per
block
for
six
blocks
barely
catching
the


kronecker
bus
his
wristwatch
would
delight
in
the
feeling
of
the
crisp
wind
rushing
over
its
face
harold
would
review



tax
files
as
a
senior
agent
for
the
internal
revenue
service
regs
section

b
i

diane

thanks
good
morning

irs
harold


times
that
adds
up
only
taking
a


minute
lunch
break
and
a
minute
coffee
break
timed
precisely
by
his
wristwatch
yeah

well
go
to
mullens
or
weii
beyond
that

harold
lived
a
life
of
solitude
he
would
walk
home
alone
he
would
eat
alone
and
at
precisely


every
night
harold
would
go
to
bed
alone
placing
his
wristwatch
to
rest
on
the
nightstand
beside
him
that
was

of
course

before
wednesday
on
wednesday

harolds
wristwatch
changed
everything
oh

my
god

you
got
it
if
one
had
asked
harold

he
would
have
said
that
this
particular
wednesday
was
exactly
like
all
the
wednesdays
prior
and
he
began
it
the
same
way
he
and
he
began
it
the
same
way
he
always
did
he
began
it
the
same
way
he
always
did
when
others
minds
would
hello
is
someone
there
when
others
minds
would
fantasize
about
their
upcoming
day
or
even
try
to
grip
onto
the
final
moments
of
their
dreams
harold
just
counted
brushstrokes
all
right

who
just
said

harold
just
counted
brushstrokes
and
how
do
you
know
im
counting
brushstrokes
it
was
remarkable
how
the
simple

modest
it
was
remarkable
h
it
was
remarkable
how
the
simple

modest
elements
of
harolds
life
so
often
taken
for
granted
would
become
the
catalyst
for
an
entirely
new
life
harold
ran
for
the
bus
his
stiff
leather
shoes
making
a
terrible
squeaking
sound
as
they
flexed
against
the
asphalt
and
though
this
was
an
extraordinary
day
a
day
to
be
remembered
for
the
rest
of
harolds
life
harold
just
thought
it
was
a
wednesday
im
sorry

did
you
hear
that
the
voice

did
you
hear
it
harold
thought
it
was
a
wednesday
dont
worry

it
is
wednesday
no

no

did
you
hear
it
harold
just
thought
it
was
a
wednesday
whos

harold
harold

okay

its
wednesday
no

no

i
never
mind
harold
couldnt
concentrate
on
his
work
excuse
me

harold
his
thoughts
were
scattered

his
mind
elsewhere
someone
here
should
be
able
to
fix
hold
on
a
second
hey

harold

whats

times
when
a
coworker
asked
the
product
of

and
you
know
what
i
cant
think
while
youre
talking
he
drew
a
blank
harold
quickly
answered



what
oh

nothing
despite
the
answer
really
being
wait

wait

wait



sorry
dude

i
just
totally
caught
some
insurance
adjuster
claiming
his
jet
ski
as
a
work
vehicle
ill
tell
you

it
is
a
shame
that
they
dont
give
out
an
auditor
of
the
year
award
dude
you
okay
dave

im
being
followed
how
are
you
being
followed
youre
not
moving
its
by
a
voice

what
im
being
followed
by
a
womans
voice
shes
narrating
harold

youre
staring
at
boxes

what
is
she
narrating
no

no

no

i
had
to
stop
filing
watch

watch

listen

listen
the
sound
the
paper
made
against
the
folder
had
the
same
tone
as
a
wave
scraping
against
sand
and
when
harold
thought
about
it
he
listened
to
enough
waves
every
day
to
constitute
what
he
imagined
to
be
a
deep
and
endless
ocean
you
mean
you
filing
no

no

no

the
voice
frightening
part
is
sometimes
i
do
imagine
a
deep
and
endless
ocean
what
ocean
the
one
made
by
the
sound
forget
it
new
audits

have
a
good
day
all
right

we
got
a
baker
and
a
securities
trader
maybe
you
should
take
the
baker
okay
okay
damn
it
damn
it
damn
it
you
miscreant

i
understand
oh

get
bent

taxman
taxman
taxman
taxman
listen

is
there
somewhere
else
we
could
talk
about
this
no

were
gonna
talk
about
this
right
here
okay

it
says

the
file

that
you
only
paid
part
of
your
taxes
for
last
year
thats
right

looks
like
only

percent
so
you
did
it
on
purpose
so
you
must
have
been
expecting
an
audit
i
was
expecting
a
fine
or
a
sharp
reprimand
a
reprimand
this
isnt
boarding
school

ms

pascal
you
stole
from
the
government
no

i
didnt
steal
from
the
government

i
just
didnt
pay
you
entirely
ms

pascal

you
cant
just
not
pay
your
taxes
yes

i
can
you
can
if
you
wanna
get
audited
only
if
i
recognize
your
right
to
audit
me

mr

crick
ms

pascal

im
right
here
auditing
you
now
i
have
to
go
over
your
past
three
years
to
make
sure
thats
all
you
havent
paid
actually

you
know

its
not
fine
listen

im
a
big
supporter
of
fixing
potholes
and
erecting
swing
sets
and
building
shelters
i
am
more
than
happy
to
pay
those
taxes
im
just
not
such
a
big
fan
of
the
percentage
that
the
government
uses
for
national
defense
corporate
bailouts
and
campaign
discretionary
funds
so
i
didnt
pay
those
taxes
i
think

actually
i
sent
a
letter
to
that
effect
with
my
return
would
it
be
the
letter
that
begins

dear
imperialist
swine
ms

pascal

what
youre
describing
is
anarchy

are
you
an
anarchist
you
mean
am
i
a
member
of
an
anarchist
group

yes
anarchists
have
a
group
i
believe
so

sure
they
assemble
wouldnt
that
completely
defeat
the
purpose
it
was
difficult
for
harold
to
imagine
ms

pascal
as
a
revolutionary
not
now

her
thin
arms
what
hoisting
protest
signs
her
long
shapely
legs
nothing
dashing
from
tear
gas
harold
wasnt
prone
to
fantasies
and
so
he
tried
his
best
to
remain
professional
but

of
course

failed
he
couldnt
help
but
imagine
ms

pascal
stroking
the
side
of
his
face
with
the
soft
blade
of
her
finger
he
couldnt
help
but
imagine
her
immersed
in
a
tub
shaving
her
legs
and
he
couldnt
help
but
imagine
her
naked
stretched
across
his
bed

mr

crick
mr

crick

yes

what
is
it
youre
staring
at
my
tits
i
wa
i
dont
think
i
was

i
dont
think
i
would
do
that
if
i
was

i
can
assure
you
it
was
only
as
a
representative
of
the
united
states
government
sorry

im
just
having
issues
today

so
ill
be
back
on
tuesday
harold
suddenly
found
himself
beleaguered
and
exasperated
outside
the
bakery
shut
up
cursing
the
heavens
in
futility
no

im
not

im
cursing
you

you
stupid
voice
so
shut
up
and
leave
me
alone
hey

watch
it
are
you
miss
eiffel
yes

excellent
may
i
ask
what
youre
doing
research
oh

am
i
interrupting
yes
im
sorry

im
penny
escher
im
the
assistant
your
publishers
hired
the
spy

the
assistant
i
provide
the
same
services
as
a
secretary
i
dont
need
a
secretary
then
i
will
have
to
find
some
other
way
of
occupying
my
time
like
watching
me
like
a
vulture
because
the
publishers
think
i
have
writers
block

right
do
you
have
writers
block
are
these
pages
theyre
letters

to
me
are
you
writing
back
i
dont
respond
to
letters
and
i
suppose
you
smoked
all
these
cigarettes
no

they
came
presmoked
yeah

they
said
you
were
funny
what
do
you
think
about
leaping
off
a
building
i
dont
think
about
leaping
off
buildings
yes

you
do

no

i
try
to
think
of
nice
things
everyone
thinks
about
leaping
off
buildings
well

i
certainly
dont
think
about
leaping
off
of
a
building
i
read
this
in
this
fantastically
depressing
book
that
when
you
jump
from
a
building
its
rarely
the
impact
that
actually
kills
you
well

im
sure
it
doesnt
help
theres
a
photograph
in
the
book
called
the
leaper
its
old

but
its
beautiful
from
above
the
corpse
of
a
woman
whod
just
leapt
to
her
death
theres
blood
around
her
head

like
a
halo
and
her
legs
buckled
underneath

her
arms
snapped
like
a
twig
but
her
face
is
so
serene
so
at
peace
and
i
think
its
because
when
she
died
she
could
feel
the
wind
against
her
face
i
dont
know
how
to
kill
harold
crick

thats
why
they
sent
you
yes

to
help
you
how
are
you
gonna
help
me
you

who
never
thinks
of
leaping
off
buildings
what
great
inspiration
will
you
bestow
on
me
ill
tell
you

the
quaint
ideas
youve
gathered
in
your
adorable
career
as
an
assistant
are
to
no
avail
when
faced
with
killing
a
man
i
understand
do
you
i
cant
just
as
much
as
i
would
like
to
i
cannot
simply
throw
harold
crick
off
a
building
miss
eiffel

kay

ive
been
an
authors
assistant
for

years
ive
helped
more
than

authors
complete
more
than

books
and
ive
never
missed
the
deadline
and
i
have
never
gone
back
to
the
publisher
to
ask
for
more
time
now

i
will
be
available
to
you
every
minute
of
every
day
until
the
final
punctuation
is
embedded
on
the
very
last
page
i
do
not
like
loud
music

i
do
not
abide
narcotics
and
i
will
gladly
and
quietly
help
you
kill
harold
crick
i
had
a
very
interesting
little
convo
with
someone
in
your
section
they
said
you
were
feeling
a
little
wibblywobbly
catch
a
little
cubicle
fever
oh

i
dont
know

i
think
im
okay
harold

a
tree
doesnt
think
its
a
tree
it
is
a
tree
why
was
harold
talking
to
this
man
this
man
was
an
idiot
this
man
used
words
like
wibblywobbly
and
convo
and
explained
that
trees
were
trees
of
course
trees
were
trees
harold
knew
trees
were
trees
i
am
going
to
believe
you

harold
what
harold
didnt
know
was
why
he
couldnt
shake
the
smell
of
brownies
from
his
senses
why
ms

pascal
had
made
his
fingertips
quiver
and
lips
go
numb
harold
yes
sorry
whats
going
on

harold
nothing

everythings
fine
listen

according
to
your
records
you
havent
taken
vacation
in
a
few
years
now
lets
say
you
take
a
little
break
use
some
of
that
vaca
time
yeah

ill
think
about
it
im
not
really
supposed
to
do
this

but
harold
assumed
his
watch
was
simply
on
the
fritz
and
never
even
considered
that
it
might
be
trying
to
tell
him
something
in
fact

harold
had
never
once
paid
attention
to
his
watch
other
than
to
find
out
the
time
and

honestly

it
drove
his
watch
crazy
and
so

on
this
particular
wednesday
evening
as
harold
waited
for
the
bus

his
watch
suddenly
stopped
sorry

does
anyone
have
the
time
yeah

i
got


thanks
thus
harolds
watch
thrust
him
into
the
immitigable
path
of
fate
little
did
he
know
that
this
simple

seemingly
innocuous
act
would
result
in
his
imminent
death
why
my
death
when
how
imminent
okay

where
are
you
harold
would
brush
his

teeth

times
why
wont
you
say
anything
i
heard
you
that
would
result
in
his
imminent
death
i
heard
you
come
on

you
stupid
voice
harold
frantically
grabbed
his
lamp
harold

incensed

shook
the
hell
out
of
it
for
no
apparent
reason
and
smashed
it
on
the
ground

kicking
it
repeatedly
harold
took
his
kleenex
box

threw
it
across
the
room
then
stormed
the
closet
come
on

say
something
something

say
something
harold

distraught
im
afraid
what
youre
describing
is
schizophrenia
no

no

its
not
schizophrenia

its
just
a
voice
in
my
head
i
mean

the
voice
isnt
telling
me
to
do
anything
its
telling
me
what
ive
already
done
accurately
and
with
a
better
vocabulary
mr

crick

you
have
a
voice
speaking
to
you
no

not
to
me

about
me
im
somehow
involved
in
some
sort
of
story
like
im
a
character
in
my
own
life
but
the
problem
is
that
the
voice
comes
and
goes
like
there
are
other
parts
of
the
story
not
being
told
to
me
and
i
need
to
find
out
what
those
other
parts
are
before
its
too
late
before
the
story
concludes
with
your
death
mr

crick

i
hate
to
sound
like
a
broken
record
but
thats
schizophrenia
you
dont
sound
like
a
broken
record

but
its
just
not
schizophrenia
what
if
what
i
said
was
true
hypothetically
speaking

if
i
was
part
of
a
story

a
narrative
even
if
it
was
only
in
my
mind
what
would
you
suggest
that
i
do
i
would
suggest
you
take
prescribed
medication
other
than
that
i
suppose
i
would
send
you
to
see
someone
who
knows
about
literature
yeah

thats
a
good
idea
so
youre
the
gentleman
who
called
me
about
the
narrator
yes

this
narrator
says
youre
gonna
die
how
long
has
it
given
you
to
live
i
dont
know
dramatic
irony

itll
fuck
you
every
time
so
you
crazy
or
what
well
are
you
allowed
to
say
that
to
crazy
people
i
dont
know

oh

well

how
many
stairs
in
the
hallway
out
there
what
you
were
counting
them
as
we
walked

werent
you
of
course

what
bank
do
you
work
at
no
bank

irs
agent
married
no
ever
engaged
to
an
auditor

she
left
me
for
an
actuary
how
heartbreaking

live
alone
yes
any
pets
no
friends
no

well

dave
at
work
i
see

the
narrator

exactly
what
does
he
sound
like
its
a
woman
is
it
a
familiar
woman
no
someone
you
know
did
you
have
enough
time
to
count
the
tiles
in
the
bathroom
i
wasnt
counting
the
tiles
coffee
no

thank
you
sure
yes
so
this
woman

the
voice

told
you
youre
gonna
die
she
didnt
tell
me

she
doesnt
know
i
can
hear
her
but
she
said
it

yes
and
you
believed
her
shes
been
right
about
a
few
other
things
such
as
how
i
felt
about
work
you
dislike
your
work
yes
well

not
the
most
insightful
voice
in
the
world

is
it
first
thing
on
a
list
of
what
americans
hate
work
second

traffic

third

missing
socks

see
what
im
saying
sort
of
i
told
you
you
were
gonna
die

you
believe
me
no

why
i
dont
know
you
but
you
dont
know
this
narrator

well
okay

mr

crick

i
cant
help
you

why
well

im
not
an
expert
in
crazy

im
an
expert
in
literature
theory
and
i
gotta
tell
you

thus
far
there
doesnt
seem
to
be
a
single
literary
thing
about
you
i
dont
doubt
you
hear
a
voice

but
it
couldnt
possibly
be
a
narrator
because

frankly

there
doesnt
seem
to
be
much
to
narrate
beside
that

this
semester
im
teaching
five
courses
im
mentoring
two
doctoral
candidates
and
im
the
faculty
lifeguard
at
the
pool
i
just
thought
you
could
possibly
perhaps
you
should
keep
a
journal
write
down
what
she
said
or
something
thats
all
i
can
suggest
i
can
barely
remember
it
all

i
just
remember
what
little
did
he
know
that
this
did
you
say

little
did
he
know
yes
ive
written
papers
on
little
did
he
know
i
used
to
teach
a
class
based
on
little
did
he
know
i
mean

i
once
gave
an
entire
seminar
on
little
did
he
know
son
of
a
bitch

harold
little
did
he
know
means
theres
something
he
doesnt
know
that
means
theres
something
you
dont
know

did
you
know
that
i
want
you
to
come
back
friday

okay
no

imminent

you
could
be
dead
by
friday
come
back
tomorrow
at
ten
seconds
ago
you
said
you
wouldnt
help
me
its
been
a
very
revealing

seconds

harold
harold
was
deep
in
thought
for
a
few

brief
moments

from
born
boulevard
to
euclid
avenue
all
the
calculations
and
all
the
rules
and
all
the
precision
of
harolds
life
just
faded
away
how
perfect
then
that
in
this
space
ana
pascal
would
appear
ms

pascal
ms

pascal

its
harold
crick
from
the
irs
would
you
like
a
seat
nope
theres

open
ones
i
dont
care
how
are
you
im
lousy

im
being
audited
by
a
real
creep
too
i
think
i
owe
you
an
apology
really
irs
agents
were
given
rigorous
aptitude
tests
before
we
can
work
unfortunately
for
you

we
arent
tested
on
tact
or
good
manners
so
i
apologize
i
ogled
you
okay

apology
accepted
but
only
because
you
stammered
so
youre
a
frequenter
of
the
metropolitan
transit
authority
too
no

im
just
late
big
flagburning
to
get
to
its
my
weekly
evilconspiracy
and
needlepoint
group
you
wanna
come
i
left
my
thimbles
and
socialist
reading
material
at
home
so
harold
nervously
made
small
talk
you
have
very
straight
teeth
very
small
talk
thanks

theyre
real
harold
quickly
calculated
the
odds
of
making
an
ass
of
himself
in
ratio
to
the
amount
of
time
he
stayed
to
chat
this
is
my
stop

i
should
go
he
was
elated
and
surprised
see
you
soon
by
his
somewhat
flirtatious
encounter
with
ms

pascal
so
elated
that
he
exited
the
transit
authority
bus
a
good

blocks
too
early
and
would
now
have
to
walk
you
aint
down
yet

thats
right
tell
us

what
is
you
aint
got
nothin
on
me
about

emmett
cole
what
does
this
mean
well

its
about
being
around
in
the
world

doing
different
things
doing
what
you
wanna
do

come
in
mr

crick

come
in

come
in

please
how
are
you
im
fine

actually
you
can
turn
that
off
looks
like
our
narrator
hasnt
killed
you
quite
yet
no

not
yet

good

great

have
a
seat
count
the
stairs
outside
no
course
not

ive
devised
a
test
how
exciting
is
that
of

questions
which
i
think
might
help
uncover
more
truths
about
this
narrator
now

howard

harold
harold

these
may
seem
silly

but
your
candor
is
paramount
we
know
its
a
womans
voice

the
story
involves
your
death
its
modern

its
in
english
im
assuming
the
author
has
a
cursory
knowledge
of
the
city
sure

okay

good
question
one
has
anyone
recently
left
any
gifts
outside
your
home
anything
gum
money
a
large
wooden
horse
im
sorry
just
answer
the
question

no
do
you
find
yourself
inclined
to
solve
murder
mysteries
in
large

luxurious
homes
to
which
let
me
finish
to
which
you
may
or
may
not
have
been
invited
no

no

no

no
all
right

on
a
scale
of
one
to
what
would
you
consider
the
likelihood
you
might
be
assassinated
assassinated
one
being
very
unlikely


being
expecting
it
around
every
corner
i
have
no
idea
okay

let
me
rephrase
are
you
the
king
of
anything
like
what
anything
king
of
the
lanes
at
the
local
bowling
alley
king
of
the
lanes
king
of
the
lanes

king
of
the
trolls

king
of
the
trolls
yes

a
clandestine
land
found
underneath
your
floorboards
anything

no
no

thats
ridiculous
agreed

but
lets
start
with
ridiculous
and
move
backwards
now

was
any
part
of
you
at
one
time
part
of
something
else
like
do
i
have
someone
elses
arms
well

is
it
possible
at
one
time
that
you
were
made
of
stone
wood

lye

varied
corpse
parts
or
earth
made
holy
by
rabbinical
elders
no

look

im
sorry

what
do
these
questions
have
to
do
with
anything
the
only
way
to
find
out
what
story
youre
in
is
to
determine
what
stories
youre
not
in
odd
as
it
may
seem

ive
just
ruled
out
half
of
greek
literature
seven
fairy
tales


chinese
fables
and
determined
conclusively
that
you
are
not
king
hamlet
scout
finch

miss
marple
frankensteins
monster

or
a
golem
arent
you
relieved
to
know
youre
not
a
golem
yes

i
am
relieved
to
know
that
i
am
not
a
golem
do
you
have
magical
powers
may
i
ask
what
were
doing
out
here
were
imagining
car
wrecks

i
see
and
we
cant
imagine
car
wrecks
inside
did
you
know
that

percent
of
accidents
occur
in
times
of
inclement
weather
so
do

percent
of
pneumonia
cases
really
pneumonia

thats
an
interesting
way
to
die
but
how
would
harold
catch
pneumonia
have
you
written
anything
new
today
did
you
read
the
poems
i
suggested

or
make
a
list
of
words
buy
new
typing
paper

anything
no

none
of
it
sitting
in
the
rain
wont
write
books
well

that
illustrates
exactly
how
much
you
know
about
writing
books
its
literature
on
the
nicotine
patch
i
dont
need
a
nicotine
patch

penny

i
smoke
cigarettes
well

it
may
help
may
help
help
what
help
what

penny
help
write
a
novel
may
help
save
your
life
im
not
in
the
business
of
saving
lives
in
fact

just
the
opposite
whats
your
favorite
word
integer
good

good

good
do
you
aspire
to
anything
no

conquer
russia
win
a
whistling
contest
no
harold

you
must
have
some
ambition
i
dont
think
so

some
underlying
dream

think
ive
always
wanted
my
life
to
be
more
musical
like
west
side
story
no
well

ive
always
wanted
to
learn
to
play
the
guitar
the
last
thing
to
determine
conclusively
is
whether
youre
in
a
comedy
or
a
tragedy
to
quote
italo
calvino
the
ultimate
meaning
to
which
all
stories
refer
has
two
faces
the
continuity
of
life

the
inevitability
of
death
tragedy

you
die

comedy

you
get
hitched
most
comic
heroes
fall
in
love
with
people
introduced
after
the
story
has
begun
usually
people
who
hate
the
hero
initially
although
i
cant
imagine
anyone
hating
you

harold
professor
hilbert

im
an
irs
agent
everyone
hates
me
right

right

good
have
you
met
anyone
recently
who
might
loathe
the
very
core
of
you
i
just
started
auditing
a
woman
who
told
me
to
get
bent
well

sounds
like
a
comedy
try
to
develop
that
four
of
these
you
know

i
didnt
get
my
honey

honey
lulu

all

owe
well

i
wont
be
paying
no
matter
the
percentage

mr

crick

out
of
the
oven
no

i
dont
like
cookies
you
dont
like
cookies
whats
wrong
with
you
i
dont
know
everybody
likes
cookies

no

i
know
i
mean

after
a
really
awful

nogood
day
didnt
your
mama
ever
make
you
milk
and
cookies
no

my
mother
didnt
bake
the
only
cookies
i
ever
had
were
storebought
okay

sit
down
no

im
no
eat
a
cookie
i
really
cant
mr

crick

it
was
a
really
awful
day
i
know

i
made
sure
of
it
so
pick
up
the
cookie
dip
it
in
the
milk
and
eat
it
thats
a
really

really
good
cookie
so
when
did
you
decide
to
become
a
baker
in
college

oh

like
a
cooking
college
i
went
to
harvard
law
actually
oh

im
sorry

i
just
assumed
it
was
no

no

its
fine

i
didnt
finish
did
something
happen
no
i
was
barely
accepted

i
mean

really
barely
the
only
reason
they
let
me
come
was
because
of
my
essay
how
i
was
gonna
make
the
world
a
better
place
with
my
degree
anyway

we
would
have
to
participate
in
these
study
sessions
my
classmates
and
i

sometimes
all
night
long
and
so
id
bake
so
no
one
would
go
hungry
while
we
worked
sometimes
i
would
bake
all
afternoon
in
the
kitchen
in
the
dorm
and
then
id
bring
my
little
treats
to
the
study
groups
and
people
loved
them
eat
i
made
oatmeal
cookies

peanutbutter
bars
darkchocolate
macadamianut
wedges
and
everyone
would
eat
and
stay
happy
and
study
harder
and
do
better
on
the
tests
more
and
more
people
started
coming
to
the
study
groups
and
id
bring
more
snacks
i
was
always
looking
for
better
and
better
recipes
until
soon
it
was
ricotta
cheese
and
apricot
croissants
and
mocha
bars
with
an
almond
glaze
and
lemon
chiffon
cake
with
zesty
peach
icing
and
at
the
end
of
the
semester
i
had

study
partners
eight
mead
journals
filled
with
recipes
and
a
d
average
so
i
dropped
out
i
figured
if
i
was
gonna
make
the
world
a
better
place
i
would
do
it
with
cookies
you
like
them
i
do
thank
you
for
forcing
me
to
eat
them
i
should
go

oh

thank
you

for
the
cookies

i
mean
why
dont
you
take
them
home
oh

no
oh

come
on

no

really

please
no

really

please

no

no

no

really

please
i
would
like
to

but
i
cant
you
cant
no

no

i
mean
because

see

it
constitutes
a
gift
actually
i
shouldnt
have
even
had
those
other
ones

so
okay

well

im
not
gonna
tell
anyone
no

i
know

but
if
you
did

well

im
not
going
to
i
know

but
if
you
did
what

you
think
im
gonna
call
the
no

no

ill
purchase
them
im
happy
to
purchase
them

hows
that
and
then
there
are
no
issues
please

just
why
dont
i
just
go
home
really

its
not
a
big
deal
you
baked
those
cookies
for
me

didnt
you
you
were
just
trying
to
be
nice
and
i
totally
blew
it
this
may
sound
like
gibberish
to
you
but
i
think
im
in
a
tragedy
professor
hilbert

ive
totally
failed
at
the
comedytragedy
thing
in
fact

i
think
she
likes
me
even
less
i
know

its
great

what
do
you
mean
youve
proved
something
else
entirely
the
voice
seems
to
be
dependent
on
actions
you
take
you
reset
your
watch

it
says
you
reset
your
watch
you
ride
a
bus

it
says
you
ride
the
bus
you
brush
your
teeth

it
says
you
brush
your
teeth
it
may
be
that
you
yourself
are
perpetuating
the
story
so
i
suggest
we
try
something
else

like
what
try
nothing

nothing

what
about
ms

pascal
forget
her

forget
her
other
than
numbers

shes
all
i
think
about
harold

if
you
wanna
stay
alive

youll
try
something
else
that
something
being
nothing
nothing

exactly
nothing
let
me
explain
this
again
some
plots
are
moved
forward
by
external
events
and
crises
others
are
moved
forward
by
the
characters
themselves
if
i
go
through
that
door

the
plot
continues
the
story
of
me
through
the
door

if
i
stay
here
the
plot
cant
move
forward

the
story
ends
also
if
i
stay
here

im
late
dont
do
anything
tomorrow

nothing
stay
home

dont
answer
the
phone

open
the
door

brush
your
teeth
what
about
work
call
them
tell
them
youre
not
coming

dont
go
to
work
dont
do
anything
that
may
move
the
plot
forward
instead

lets
see
if
the
plot
finds
you
marshall

youre
not
kicking
certain
that
these
geese
have
never
known
any
home
but
this
one
a
small
lake
in
eastern
poland
pollution
from
a
nearby
factory
is
slowly
killing
the
small
fish
and
insects
on
which
these
creatures
feed
all
attempts
to
move
the
birds
to
similar
bodies
of
water
have
failed
perhaps
it
is
the
familiarity
alone
that
keeps
them
here
or
perhaps
its
an
unwillingness
to
lose
the
collective
memory
of
the
oncebeautiful
hills
that
surround
the
lake
and
it
takes
only
seconds
for
the
fiddler
crabs
to

now

the

the

mccarthy
did
you
say

yes
im
not
exactly
sure
it
was
plot
i
was
hoping
youd
say
it
was
just
a
really
bad
coincidence
meeting
an
insurance
agent
the
day
your
policy
runs
out
is
coincidence
getting
a
letter
from
the
emperor
saying
that
hes
visiting
is
plot
having
your
apartment
eaten
by
a
wrecking
ball
is
something
else
entirely
harold

you
dont
control
your
fate
i
know

you
do
okay

come
with
me
hey

tom

can
you
leave
that
till
tomorrow
you
were
right

this
narrator
might
very
well
kill
you

i
humbly
suggest
that
you
just
forget
all
this
and
go
live
your
life
go
live
my
life
i
am
living
my
life

id
like
to
continue
to
live
my
life
i
know

of
course

i
mean
all
of
it

however
long
you
have
left
you
know

i
mean

howard

you
could
use
it
to
have
an
adventure
you
know

invent
something

or
just
finish
reading
crime
and
punishment
hell

harold

you
could
just
eat
nothing
but
pancakes
if
you
wanted
whats
wrong
with
you
hey

i
dont
wanna
eat
nothing
but
pancakes

i
wanna
live
who
in
their
right
mind
in
a
choice
between
pancakes
and
living
chooses
pancakes
harold

if
youd
pause
to
think
i
believe
youd
realize
that
that
answers
inextricably
contingent
upon
the
type
of
life
being
led
and

of
course

the
quality
of
the
pancakes
you
dont
understand
what
im
saying
yes

i
do
but
you
have
to
understand
that
this
isnt
a
philosophy
or
a
literary
theory
or
a
story
to
me

its
my
life
absolutely

so
just
go
make
it
the
one
youve
always
wanted
i
never
expected
that
they
would
have
do
you
want
one

two
i
want
one
one
i
want
two
all
right

as
i
like
to
call
it

hypothetical

guitars
seven
hundred
and

hundred
and
fiftyseven
pickups
one
hundred
and
eightynine
volume
knobs
here
harold
stood

face
to
face
with
his
oldest
desire
and
stand
is
almost
all
harold
did
it
wasnt
just
about
finding
a
guitar
it
was
about
finding
a
guitar
that
said
something
about
harold
unfortunately

this
guitar
said
when
i
get
back
to
georgia

that
woman
gonna
feel
my
pain
this
one
said
something
along
the
lines
of
why

yes

these
pants
are
lycra
these
said

im
very
sensitive

very
caring
and
i
have
absolutely
no
idea
how
to
play
the
guitar
im
compensating
for
something

guess
what
and
then
harold
saw
it
a
damaged
and
terribly
mistreated
seafoamgreen
fender
staring
back
at
him
despite
its
obvious
maladies
the
guitar
spoke
with
conviction
and
swagger
in
fact

it
looked
harold
directly
in
the
eye
and
very
plainly
stated
i
rock
just
breathe

watch
it
weve
got
a

yearold
male
with
a
gunshot
wound
to
the
chest
shot
in
a
gang
fight
harolds
not
in
a
gang
man
in
tweed
theres
nothing
wrong
with
him

he
just
likes
looking
at
sick
people
oddly
spoken
with
disdain
this
isnt
working
well
i
dont
even
know
why
were
here
i
dont
think
were
supposed
to
be
here
you
said
i
needed
visual
stimuli

i
meant
a
museum
i
dont
need
a
goddamn
museum

i
need
the
infirm
you
are
the
infirm
youre
right

the
problem
is
these
people
arent
dead
theyre
just
severely
injured
excuse
me

where
are
the
dying
people
most
of
these
people
are
sick
or
injured
which
is
great

dont
get
me
wrong
but
theyre
gonna
get
better

which
doesnt
really
help
me
is
there
any
way
to
see
the
people
who
arent
going
to
get
better
id
like
to
see

if
at
all
possible

the
ones
who
arent
gonna
make
it
you
know

the
deadforsure
ones
im
sorry

are
you
suffering
from
anything
just
writers
block
with
every
awkward
strum
harold
crick
became
stronger
in
who
he
was
what
he
wanted

and
why
he
was
alive
harold
no
longer
ate
alone
he
no
longer
counted
brushstrokes
harold

ill
see
you

he
no
longer
wore
neckties
bye

dave
and

therefore

no
longer
worried
about
the
time
it
took
to
put
them
on
he
no
longer
counted
his
steps
to
the
bus
stop
instead

harold
did
that
which
had
terrified
him
before
that
which
had
eluded
him
monday
through
friday
for
so
many
years
that
which
the
unrelenting
lyrics
of
numerous
punkrock
songs
told
him
to
do
harold
crick
lived
his
life
but
despite
resuscitating
his
life
reviving
his
hope

and
instilling
a
few
wicked
calluses
harolds
journey
was
still
incomplete
and
harolds
wristwatch
wasnt
about
to
let
him
miss
another
opportunity
ms

pascal
ms

pascal

crick

harolds
life
was
filled
with
moments
both
significant
and
mundane
but
to
harold

those
moments
remained
entirely
indistinguishable
except
for
this
as
ana
let
out
a
soft
sigh
and
repositioned
herself
against
him
harold
knew
somewhere
in
his
heart
that
this
was
one
of
the
significant
moments
he
knew
she
was
falling
in
love
with
him
professor
hilbert

its
a
comedy
what
a
comedy
the
woman

the
one
who
hates
me

ana
pascal
last
night

yeah
shes
falling
in
love
with
me

a
miracle
the
voice
confirmed
it
in
the
middle
of
the
night
well

thats
wonderful

harold
i
mean

it
completely
nullifies
my
list

but
thats
fantastic
what
list
these
are
seven
living
authors
whose
prior
work
would
seem
to
make
them
candidates
to
write
your
story
based
on
the
criteria
you
and
i
previously
determined
if
your
narrator
is
alive

shes
on
this
list
but
it
appears
the
list
is
of
little
use
to
you
now
now
that
youre
gonna
live
happily
ever
after

just
calm
harold

im
sorry
you
have
to
die
its
her
masterpiece
its
possibly
the
most
important
novel
in
her
already
stunning
career
and
its
absolutely
no
good
unless
you
die
at
the
end
ive
been
over
it
again
and
again
and
i
know
how
hard
this
is
for
you
to
hear
youre
asking
me
to
knowingly
face
my
death
i
thought
youd

i
thought
youd
find
something
im
sorry

harold
cant
we
just
try
and
just
see
if
she
can
change
it
in
the
grand
scheme
it
wouldnt
matter
yes

it
would

no
i
could
change
i
could
quit
my
job
i
could
go
away
with
ana
i
could
be
someone
else
harold

listen
to
me
i
cant
die
right
now
its
just
really
bad
timing
no
one
wants
to
die

harold

but
unfortunately
we
do
harold

you
will
die
someday

sometime
heart
failure
at
the
bank
choke
on
a
mint
some
long

drawnout
disease
you
contracted
on
vacation
you
will
die

you
will
absolutely
die
even
if
you
avoid
this
death

another
will
find
you
and
i
guarantee
that
it
wont
be
nearly
as
poetic
or
meaningful
as
what
shes
written
but
its
the
nature
of
all
tragedies

harold
the
hero
dies

but
the
story
lives
on
forever
theres
an
empty
seat
right
there

no

i
wanna
sit
down
over
here
how
many
people
do
you
think
ive
killed
kay

how
many
i
dont
know

eight
kay
ive
killed
eight
people

i
counted
theyre
fictional

get
up
harold
crick
isnt
fictional
i
dont
he
isnt
fictional

penny
every
book
ive
ever
written
ends
with
someone
dying

every
one
really
nice
people
too
the
book
about
helen
the
schoolteacher
i
killed
her
the
day
before
summer
vacation
how
cruel
is
that
and
the
civil
engineer

edward
the
one
i
trapped
with
a
heart
attack
in
rush
hour
i
killed
him
i
killed
penny

i
killed
them
all
miss
eiffel
miss
eiffel
harold

hi
i
just
finished
it

you
just
yeah

i
read
it
all
in
one
read
on
the
bus
i
like
the
part
about
the
guitars
well

thanks

thanks

goo
well

listen

im
no

i
read
it
and
i
loved
it

and
theres
only
one
way
it
can
end
i
mean

i
dont
have
much
background
in
literary
anything
but
this
seems
simple
enough
i
love
your
book

and
i
think
you
should
finish
it
the
night
before
his
death
harold
unsuspectingly
went
about
some
usual
business
he
finished
his
outstanding
audits
he
made
a
few
phone
calls
he
had
been
putting
off
listen

does
your
program
have
an
age
limit
and
he
traveled
to
ms

pascals
where
she
made
him
meat
loaf
and
chocolate
pudding
and
the
two
watched
old
movies
it
was
a
nice
enough
evening
and
in
any
other
circumstance
it
wouldve
seemed
commonplace
in
fact

the
only
thing
that
made
this
night
significant
was
the
morning
it
preceded
i
have
to
tell
you
something
you
do
i
do
is
it
a
secret
sort
of
i
adore
you
i
adore
you
too
that
it
no
i
have
to
tell
you
this
i
just
want
you
to
listen
carefully
you
can
deduct
the
value
of
all
the
food
you
give
away
as
a
charitable
contribution

harold
no

no

no

in
fact
it
amounts
to
more
than
what
youre
currently
withholding
and
it
doesnt
break
any
tax
laws
harold

the
point
is
to
break
the
tax
laws
i
wanna
make
the
world
a
better
place
too

ana
i
think
that
means
keeping
you
out
of
jail
if
you
come
over
here
and
talk
a
little
more
tax
talk
in
my
ear
because
i
like
it
so
much
much
had
changed
for
harold
over
the
past
few
weeks
his
attitude
towards
work
his
habitual
counting
his
love
life
but
of
all
the
transmutations
harold
crick
had
undergone
perhaps
the
most
significant
was
that
today
on
his
return
to
work
he
was
not
late
for
the


kronecker
bus
what
harold
had
not
understood
about
that
wednesday
four
weeks
prior
was
that
the
time
he
received
from
his
fellow
commuter
was

in
fact

three
full
minutes
later
than
the
actual
time
and

therefore

three
full
minutes
later
than
the
time
to
which
his
watch
and
life
had
been
previously
set
not
the
worst
of
errors
but
if
harold
had
not
set
his
watch
to
the
incorrect
time
harold
would
have
again
barely
caught
the


kronecker
bus
and
he
would
not
be
approaching
the
bus
stop
precisely
at


this
particular
friday
an
otherwise
ignorable
fact
until
the
unthinkable
occurred
i
need
for
everyone
to
just
stay
seated
come
on

son
what
happened
i
didnt
see
him

it
was
not
your
fault
he
was
trying
to
help
the
boy

get
your
supervisor
i
dont
believe
this
it
was
all
my
fault

though

no

it
wasnt
it
looks
likes
hes
breathing

i
dont
think
hes
breathing
are
you
professor
hilbert
hi

im
karen
eiffel
i
believe
we
have
a
mutual
acquaintance
please

sit
down
no

i
just
came
by
to
is
that
it
yes
have
you
read
it
i
think

perhaps

you
may
be
interested
in
the
new
ending
its
a
pretty
brave
thing
you
did
stepping
in
front
of
that
bus
was
pretty
brave
kind
of
stupid

but
pretty
brave
is
that
boy
okay
hes
just
fine

scratched
up
is
all
oh

good
well

youre
not
dead
on
the
other
hand

it
looks
like
you
cracked
your
head
you
broke
three
bones
in
your
leg
and
foot
you
suffered
four
broken
ribs

fractured
your
left
arm
and
severed
an
artery
in
your
right

which
shouldve
killed
you
in
minutes
but
amazingly
a
shard
of
metal
from
your
watch
obstructed
the
artery
keeping
the
blood
loss
low
enough
to
keep
you
alive
which
is
pretty
cool
yeah

so
with
some
physical
therapy
a
few
months
of
rest

you
should
be
fine
well

sort
of

we
werent
able
to
remove
the
shard
of
watch
from
your
arm
without
risking
severe
arterial
damage
youll
be
okay

youll
just
have
a
piece
of
watch
embedded
in
your
arm
the
rest
of
your
life
youre
very
lucky
to
be
alive

mr

crick
dr

mercator

mr

crick
has
a
visitor

sure
my
god

harold

hey
im
okay

its
all
right

harold
harold

youre
not
fine
look
at
you

youre
severely
injured
no

im
fine

what
what
happened
i
stepped
in
front
of
a
bus
what
why
there
was
a
boy

i
had
to
push
him
out
of
the
way
i
had
to
keep
this
boy
from
getting
hit
you
stepped
in
front
of
a
bus
to
save
a
little
boy
i
didnt
have
a
choice
its

its
okay
its
not
great

no
its
okay

its
not
bad
its
not
the
most
amazing
piece
of
english
literature
in
several
years
but
its
okay
i
think
im
fine
with
okay
it
doesnt
make
sense
with
the
rest
of
the
book
though
no

not
yet

ill
rewrite
the
rest
my
assistant
said
shed
go
back
to
the
publisher
and
request
more
time

why
dont
know

its
awfully
sweet
though
no

why
did
you
change
the
book
lots
of
reasons
i
realized
i
just
couldnt
do
it
because
hes
real
because
its
a
book
about
a
man
who
doesnt
know
hes
about
to
die
and
then
dies
but
if
the
man
does
know
hes
going
to
die
and
dies
anyway
dies
willingly

knowing
he
could
stop
it

then
i
mean

isnt
that
the
type
of
man
you
want
to
keep
alive
as
harold
took
a
bite
of
bavarian
sugar
cookie
he
finally
felt
as
if
everything
was
going
to
be
okay
sometimes

when
we
lose
ourselves
in
fear
and
despair
in
routine
and
constancy
in
hopelessness
and
tragedy
we
can
thank
god
for
bavarian
sugar
cookies
and
fortunately

when
there
arent
any
cookies
we
can
still
find
reassurance
in
a
familiar
hand
on
our
skin
or
a
kind
and
loving
gesture
or
a
subtle
encouragement
or
a
loving
embrace
or
an
offer
of
comfort
not
to
mention
hospital
gurneys
and
nose
plugs
and
uneaten
danish
and
softspoken
secrets
and
fender
stratocasters
and
maybe
the
occasional
piece
of
fiction
and
we
must
remember
that
all
these
things
the
nuances

the
anomalies

the
subtleties
which
we
assume
only
accessorize
our
days
are

in
fact

here
for
a
much
larger
and
nobler
cause
they
are
here
to
save
our
lives
i
know
the
idea
seems
strange
but
i
also
know
that
it
just
so
happens
to
be
true
and
so
it
was
let
us
finish
it
perhaps
it
is
a
trap

it
is
then
what
do
we
do
we
break
through
i
see
him
pagans
forward
still

retreat
no
do
not
stop
we
are
her
salvation

and
through
her
command
we
shall
live
forever
i
will
not
die

not
here

not
now
were
almost
there
youll
make
it

i
wont
let
you
die

increase
in
neural
activity
in
all
areas
usually
stunted
by
ageing
and
the
tumor
no
change
the
growth
patterns
are
normal

theres
no
positive
or
negative
effect
we
should
tell
dr

guzetti
right
away

no
no
antonio
prep
a
new
cocktail

stick
with
the
same
substance
were
moving
forward

wait
but
this
could
be
a
medical
first
a
revelation
weve
gotta
pursue
it
and
duplicate
the
findings
we
can
monitor
synaptic
growth

but
our
focus
is
tumors

not
ageing
i
know

but
i
want
the
next
subject
ready
for
surgery
is
everything
all
right
yes
everythings
all
right
inquisitor
enter
the
heretics
they
have
confessed
and
ceded
their
lands
to
your
holy
office
they
await
yourjudgment
yet
another
slice
of
her
nation
is
mine
soon
she
will
be
powerless
against
me
queen
of
nothing
but
her
sins
what
will
you
do
with
her
she
too
will
confess

and
then
she
too
will
die
captain

tis
the
queen
she
is
surrounded
the
inquisitor
demands
blood
then
there
is
no
more
time
what
is
our
response
go
now

warn
the
queen
and
you
where
are
you
going
he
must
be
cut
out
she
has
forbidden
it

there
is
no
other
choice
this
is
our
only
hope
stay

stay
our
bodies
are
prisons
for
our
souls
our
skin
and
blood

the
iron
bars
of
confinement
but
fear
not
all
flesh
decays
death
turns
all
to
ash
and

thus
death
frees
every
soul
you

the
condemned
you
have
confessed
you
admit
to
protecting
a
queen
who
twists
the
word
of
god
and
drowns
all
spain
in
sin
your
queen
seeks
immortality
on
earth
a
false
paradise
this
is
heresy
she
leads
you
towards
vanity
away
from
the
spirit
but
this
is
foolishness
for
death
exists
the
day
of
judgment
is
irrefutable
all
life
must
be
judged
why
are
you
here
come
quickly
leave

protect
the
queen

she
sent
me

she
demands
your
return
she
desires
a
private
audience
but
fear
not

she
will
not
be
in
hell
alone
i
will
make
sure
her
servants
are
waiting
for
her
faithful
servant

why
do
you
cry
to
see
spain
brought
so
low
with
an
enemy
thriving
within
her
borders

feasting
on
her
strength
the
shame
is
too
much

ive
failed
her
dare
not
pity
spain
these
times
are
dark
but
every
shadow

no
matter
how
deep

is
threatened
by
morning
light
this
loyalty
of
yours
inspires
you
to
protect
spain
at
any
cost
but
killing
the
inquisitor
is
suicide
europe
would
have
my
head
i

for
one

am
not
ready
to
die
yet

are
you
i
will
die
for
spain
i
know

conquistador
i
know
and
this
bravery
of
yours

it
may
save
us
yet
for
spain
has
a
plan
there
is
hope
theres
hope
father
i
am
father
avila
of
her
royal
franciscan
order
our
allegiance
remains
with
spain
guards

leave
us
conquistador
i
am
going
to
tell
you
the
true
reason
why
the
inquisitor
pits
cross
against
crown
one
year
ago

father
avila
returned
from
the
jungles
of
new
spain
with
a
secret
so
great
it
promised
to
free
all
mankind
from
tyranny
spain
desired
this
treasure
above
all
things
but
the
inquisitor
feared
it
with
equal
measure
when
i
refused
to
give
up
my
quest
for
it
he
responded
with
this
violent
coup
to
bring
spain
to
her
knees
but
we
have
not
yielded
and
now
we
will
defeat
him
this
is
our
hope
a
dagger
used
in
religious
rituals
i
took
it
from
a
dead
mayan
priest
the
marking
on
the
hilt
do
you
see
it
it
is
a
map
a
map
to
the
mayans
greatest
secret
greater
than
chichen
itz�

greater
than
yaxchil�n

greater
even
than
tikal
we
will
find
a
lost
pyramid
not
lost
hidden

the
hidden
pyramid
of
the
mayan
myths
the
myths
tell
us
of
a
holy
pyramid
built
upon
the
navel
of
the
earth
the
birthplace
of
life
a
special
tree
sprouts
there
they
say
whoever
drinks
of
its
sap
will
live
forever
eternal
life
spain
hangs
at
the
whims
of
a
merciless
enemy
and
you
taunt
us
with
yarns
they
are
not
yarns
remember
our
own
bible
confirms
it
in
genesis

there
are
two
trees
in
the
garden
of
eden
the
tree
of
knowledge
and
the
tree
of
life
when
adam
and
eve
disobeyed
the
lord
and
ate
from
the
tree
of
knowledge
the
lord
banned
them
from
the
garden
and
hid
the
tree
of
life
kneel

conquistador
let
in
the
morning
light
the
beast
runs
amok
in
my
kingdom
he
has
isolated
me
and
now
he
is
sharpening
his
talons
for
one
more
fateful
push
but
salvation
lies
in
the
jungles
of
new
spain
will
you
deliver
spain
from
bondage
upon
my
honor
and
my
life
then
you
shall
take
this
ring
to
remind
you
of
your
promise
you
shall
wear
it
when
you
find
eden
and
when
you
return
i
shall
be
your
eve
together

we
will
live
forever
there
you
are

hey

very
first
human
he
sacrificed
himself
to
make
the
world
the
tree
of
lifes
bursting
out
of
his
belly

come
on
listen

his
body
became
the
trees
roots

they
spread
and
formed
the
earth
his
soul
became
the
branches

rising
up

forming
the
sky
all
that
remained

first
fathers
head
his
children
hung
it
in
the
heavens

the
greek
olympiad
is
crazy
i

yes

its
a
combination
of
skill

endurance

athleticism

there
is
a
degree
of
perversion
in
these

dont
think
would
serve
you
kids
well
do
you
happen
to
remember
the
name
of
the
last

the

the
closer
you

a
pro
the
closer
you
can

the
client
the
knife

so
it

you

be
watering
me
if
you

me
to
grow
they

leon
i

leon
all
the
money
i
make

that
you

you
need
some
money
just
curious
ive

because
of
a
woman
dont

leon

i
wish
i
could
sometimes
you

little
to
someone
you
know

to
help
out
its
your
money

holding
it
for

a
fake
just
part

your
cover
to
protect
the
secrecy
of
the

and
what

the
hive
accessing
schematic
of
the
hive
raccoon
city

nearest
urban
center
the
mansion
where

found
you

through
which
we
gained
access
to
the
train
which

in
turn

brought
us
to
the
hive
the
hive
itself
is
located
underground
deep
beneath

their
research
is
of
the
highest
importance
its
nature
is

our
position
on

is
indicated
by
heat
signature
why
cant

remember
anything
the

defense
mechanisms
all
computercontrolled
a
nerve
gas
was
released
into
the
house
primary
effect
of
the
gas
complete
unconsciousness
lasting
anything
up
to
four
hours
secondary
effects
are
varied

but
can
include
acute
memory
loss
for
how
long
subjective
an
hour

day

week

a
little
more
complicated
than
that
sir
weve
breached
the
hive
jd
halon
content
has
dissipated
makes
it
easier
to
work
underground

thinking
theres
a
view
looks
like
were
taking
the
stairs
status

red
queen
is
locked
onto
us
she
knows
that
were
here
whos
the
red
queen
stateoftheart
artificial
intelligence
she
is
the
computer
that
controls
the
hive
this
is
gonna
slow
us
down
our
route
to
the
queen
takes
us
straight
through
these
labs
rain

jd


see
how
bad
the
flooding
is
kaplan

find
us
an
alternate
route
what
happened
here
five
hours
ago

red
queen
went
homicidal
sealed
the
hive
and
killed
everyone
down
here
jesus

when
we
realized
what
was
happening
my
team
was
dispatched
to
shut
her
down
why
did
she
do
it
that
we
dont
know
but
outside
interference
is
a
possibility
jesus
hey

you
okay
here

no
im
fine

please

come
on
im
fine

please

come
on
do
you
remember
anything
from
before
this
no

nothing
i
found
an
alternate
route

but
its
gonna
cost
us
time
we
double
back

cut
through
dining
hall
b
then
were
right
on
track
sir

no
go

the
whole
levels
flooded
all
right

were
behind
schedule
so
lets
move
it
poor
bastards
dining
hall
b
thats
what
it
says
on
the
map
maybe
youre
reading
it
wrong
maybe
the
corporations
keeping
a
few
secrets
down
here
jd


you
and
rain
keep
the
prisoner
here
and
secure
the
exit
sir

halon
levels
are
nonexistent
in
this
room
i
think
the
system
malfunctioned
all
right

there
may
be
survivors
give
me
a
search
line

but
keep
it
tight
i
said
keep
it
tight

sorry
im
not
sure
i
want
to
remember
what
went
on
down

dont
blame

transmitter
in
position

roger
running
the
bypass
checkmate
what
is
that
thats
what
will
shut
the
queen
down
delivers
a
massive
electrical
charge
scrambles
the
mainframe
and
forces
it
to
reboot
some
kind
of
dormant
defense
mechanism
opening
the
door
tripped
it

put
it
back
to
sleep

the
head
programmers
daughter
shell
try

primary
power
shell
say
anything
to
stop
us
from
shutting
her
down
i
implore
you
youre
all
going
to
die
down
here
that
pulse
forces
the
circuit
breaker
to
shut
down
her
mainframe
for

seconds
after
that

if
i
dont
have
her
board

she
can
reboot
im
on

bodies
where
did
they
go
whatever
they
are

theres
too
many
of
them
out
there
whatever
they
are
its
pretty
obvious
what
they
are
lab
coats

badges

those
people
used
to
work
here
all
the
people
working
here
are
dead
well

that
isnt
stopping
them
from
walking
around
well

where
did
they
come
from
why
didnt
we
see
them
on
the
way
in
when
you
cut
the
power

you
unlocked
the
doors
you
let
them
out
were
never
gonna
make
it
to
the
surface
you
are
security
operatives
security
operatives
placed
there
to
protect
that
entrance
ive
got
one
in
the
breech
and
an
extra
mag
i
can
help
you
get
the
virus
but
but
theres
gonna
be
a
price

name
it
who
was
she
my
sister
corporations
like
umbrella
think
theyre
above
the
law
there
are
hundreds
of
thousands
of
us
who
think
the
same
all
over
the
world
some
of
us
provide
information
others
give
their
support
some
take
more
direct
action
if
your
friends
had
been
a
little
more
thorough
they
wouldve
seen
right
through
my
false
i
d
then
all
the
red
flags
wouldve
gone
off
quantico

nsa

vicap

all
the
rest
theres
no
way
i
couldve
infiltrated
the
hive
so
you
sent
your
sister
we
needed
something
concrete
anything
to
expose
umbrella
to
the
press
proof
of
the
research
that
was
going
on
down
here
what
kind
of
research
the
illegal
kind
genetic
viral
my
sister
was
going
to
smuggle
out
a
sample
of
the
virus
they
were
developing
so
how
was
she
going
to
make
it
out
of
here
she
had
a
contact
within
the
hive

someone
i
never
met
they
had
access
to
security
codes

surveillance

everything
she
needed
so
why
didnt
she
make
it
maybe
she
trusted
the
wrong
person
maybe
they
set
her
up
kept
the
virus
for
themselves
do
you
know
how
much
the
tvirus
would
be
worth
on
the
open
market
what

worth
all
this
yeah
to
someone
dont
shoot
dont
shoot
dont
shoot
dont
shoot
son
of
a
bitch
you
okay
yeah
right
behind
us

what
about
this
door
theyre
waiting
out
there
too

and
that
way
its
a
dead
end

theres
no
way
out
of
the
queens
chamber
so
we
wait
what
whats
wrong
we
dont
have
much
time
you
know
those
blast
doors
we
passed
on
the
way
in
from
the
mansion
they
seal
shut
in
just
under
an
hour
if
were
not
out
of
here
by
then

were
not
getting
out
what
are
you
talking
about
they
cant
just
bury
us
alive
down
here
containing
the
incident
is
the
only
failsafe
plan
they
had
against
possible
contamination
and
youre
only
telling
us
this
now

when
were
trapped
half
a
mile
underground
we
have
to
find
a
way
out
of
this
room
what
are
you
doing
where
are
you
taking
those
im
turning
her
back
on
that
is
not
a
good
idea

shell
know
a
way
out
of
here
that
homicidal
bitch
killed
my
team
that
homicidal
bitch
may
be
our
only
way
out
of
here
considering
the
way
shes
being
treated

im
sure
shell
be
happy
to
help
us
out
that
circuit
breaker
you
were
talking
about
can
you
bypass
it
yeah
so
do
it
all
right

circuit
breaker
is
disabled
this
time
if
i
hit
the
switch

she
wont
be
able
to
shut
down
shes
gonna
fry
kaplan
the
initial
charge
must
have
damaged
her
boards
ah

there
you
are
things

i
gather

have
gone
out
of
control
give
me
that
fucking
switch
right
now

im
gonna
fry
your
ass
i
did
warn
you

didnt
i
tell
us
whats
going
on
down
here
research
and
development
what
about
the
tvirus
what
about
the
tvirus
although
it
clearly
also
possessed
highly
profitable
military
applications
how
does
it
explain
those
things
out
there
even
in
death

the
human
body
still
remains
active
hair
and
fingernails
continue
to
grow
new
cells
are
produced
and
the
brain
itself
holds
a
small
electrical
charge
that
takes
months
to
dissipate
the
tvirus
provides
a
massive
jolt
both
to
cellular
growth
and
to
those
trace
electrical
impulses
put
quite
simply
it
reanimates
the
body
it
brings
the
dead
back
to
life
not
fully
not
fully
perhaps
a
little
memory

virtually
no
intelligence
they
are
driven
by
the
basest
of
impulses
the
most
basic
of
needs
which
is
which
is
how
do
you
kill
them
severing
the
top
of
the
spinal
column
or
massive
trauma
to
the
brain
are
the
most
effective
methods
you
mean
shoot
them
in
the
head
why
did
you
kill
everybody
down
here
the
tvirus
escaped
into
the
air
conditioning
system
and
an
uncontrolled
pattern
of
infection
began
the
virus
is
protean
changing
from
liquid
to
airborne
to
blood
transmission
depending
on
its
environment
its
almost
impossible
to
kill
i
couldnt
allow
it
to
escape
from
the
hive
so
i
took
steps
steps

you
must
understand
those
who
become
infected

i
cant
allow
you
to
leave
whoa

were
not
infected
just
one
bite

one
scratch
from
these
creatures
is
sufficient
and
then
you
become
one
of
them
a
check
of
my
systems
indicates
my
main
drive
circuit
breaker
has
been
disabled
may
i
ask
why
insurance

we
need
a
way
out
of
here
if
you
refuse
to
help
at
any
time

we
flip
the
switch
understand
what
the
hell
is
this
place
the
utility
tunnels
they
run
underneath
the
hive
for
water

gas
and
power
lines
its
been
in
here
before

keep
moving
were
going
around
in
circles

this
is
the
route
the
computer
gave
us
why
are
you
listening
to
her
enough
already
we
have
no
choice
but
to
keep
moving
cause
those
things
are
right
behind
us
that
mesh
isnt
gonna
hold

keep
moving
jesus

too
many
of
them

cure
i
was

of
this

the
truth
i
dont
understand
its
not
there
i
cant
i
just
cant
its
over
i
can
help
you
get
the
virus
i
have
access
to
security
codes

surveillance
plans

the
works
but
theres
gonna
be
a
price
name
it
you
have
to
guarantee
me
that
you
will
bring
this
corporation
down
spence
we
can
still
make
it
out
of
here

come
with
me
we
can
have
everything
weve
ever
wanted
moneys
out
there
waiting
you
wouldnt
believe
how
much
is
that
how
you
thought
all
my
dreams
were
gonna
come
true

need
the
bullets
okay

but
you
cant
just
wash
your
hands

for
the
same
company

you
knew
what
they
did
i
was
trying
to
stop
them
you
really
believe
that
people
like
him
will
ever
change
anything
ever
changes
where
is
its
on
the
train
where
you
found
me
couldnt
have
been
standing
more
than
three
feet
from
it
i
so
nearly
made
it
out
didnt
realize
that
bitch
of
a
computer
had
defense
systems
outside
the
hive
in
or
out
i
dont
know
what
we
had
but
its
over
back
the
fuck
off
im
missing
you
already
your

locking
mechanism

away
with
this
i
dont
think
so
ive
been
a
bad

bad
girl
what
the
fuck
is
that
one
of
the
hives
early
experiments
produced
by
injecting
the
tvirus
directly
into
living
tissue
the
results
were
unstable
now
that
it
has
fed
on
fresh
dna

it
will
mutate
becoming
a
stronger

faster
hunter
if
you
knew
it
was
loose

why
didnt
you
warn
us
cause
she
was
saving
it
for
us
not
without
infection
why
didnt
you
tell
us
about
the
antivirus
this
long
after
infection
theres
no
guarantee
it
would
work
but
theres
a
chance

right
i
dont
deal
in
chance
no
pressure

guys
you
require
the
fourdigit
access
code
i
can
give
you
the
code

but
first
you
must
do
something
for
me
what
do
you
want
one
of
your
group
is
infected
i
require
her
life
for
the
code
the
antivirus
is
right
there
on
the
platform
its
right
there
im
sorry
its
a
risk
i
cannot
take
youre
gonna
have
to
kill
me
otherwise
we
all
die
down
here
the
glass
is
reinforced
but
it
wont
hold
forever
do
it

what
i
didnt

anything
each

the
flu
claims
tens
of
thousands
of
american
lives
our
studies
show
this
new
virus
is
more
communicable
and
lasts
longer
than
more
common
strains
of
flu
the
cdc
has
begun
emergency
meetings
today
to
decide
how
to
keep
it
from
getting
any
worse
we
think
an
inoculation
program
is
our
our
best
shot
at
keeping
this
under
our
thumb
this
flu
season
could
be
the
deadliest
in

years
im
curious
if
you
just
cracked
this
new
virus

are
you
ready
with
vaccines

yorish
kaganovich
nice
to
meet
you

ambassador

the
pleasure
is
entirely
mine
henryks
guests
are
usually
as
old
and
as
ugly
as
i
am
i
beg
to
differ

no
ones
as
ugly
as
you
are

yorish
it
means
a
doormat
someone
still
speaks
russian
i
thought
it
was
a
dead
language
my
cheeky
friend
and
i
pretend
to
enjoy
ourselves

but
secretly
we
are
rivals
exploiting
each
other
for
personal
gain

i
am
here
to
drink
his
champagne
and
he
invites
me
because
i
can
get
the
real
caviar
a
veneer
of
civility
hides
our
true
selfinterests
its
the
nature
of
our
world

yes
yorish

be
good
im
only
curious
i
say
that
civilization
is
an
illusion

a
game
of
pretend
what
is
real
is
the
fact
that
we
are
still
animals

driven
by
primal
instincts
as
a
psychiatrist
you
must
know
this
to
be
true
to
be
honest

ambassador

when
someone
starts
talking
to
me
about
the
truth
i
hear
what
they
tell
me
about
themselves
more
than
what
they
say
about
the
world
quite
right

well
done

perhaps
you
are
right
perhaps
being
a
russian
in
this
country
is
a
kind
of
pathology
so

what
do
you
think
can
you
help
me
can
you
give
me
a
pill
to
make
me
see
the
world
the
way
you
americans
see
the
world
can
a
pill
help
me
understand
iraq

or
darfur

or
even
new
orleans
dont
be
drawn
in
by
his
madness

doctor
he
is
russian

he
needs
to
argue
like
he
needs
to
breathe
all
i
am
saying
is
that
civilization
crumbles
whenever
we
need
it
most
in
the
right
situation
we
are
all
capable
of
the
most
terrible
crimes
to
imagine
a
world
where
this
was
not
so
where
every
crisis
did
not
result
in
new
atrocities
where
every
newspaper
is
not
full
of
war
and
violence
well

this
is
to
imagine
a
world
where
human
beings
cease
to
be
human
while
ill
give
you
that
we
still
retain
some
basic
animal
instincts
you
must
admit
were
not
the
same
animal
we
were
a
few
thousand
years
ago
our
consciousness
is
changing
five
hundred
years
ago

postmodern
feminists
didnt
exist
yet
one
sits
right
beside
you
today
at
least
it
gives
me
reason
to
believe
one
day
things
may
be
different
thank
you

doctor

welcome

all
the
women

brought

some
breakfast

i
cooked
pancakes
the
thawing
in
tension
between
washington

tehran
over
the
enrichment
of

one
of
the
first
steps
by

mom

the
way
to
school
i
still
miss
you

love
you

sorry

about
wendy
lenk
i
havent
heard
from
her
maybe
its
that
flu
going
around
ill
call
her
mr

lenk

this
is
dr

bennell

i
was
hoping
i
could
speak
with
your
wife
this
is
her
cell
phone
im
calling
shes
asleep
right
now
is
everything
all
right

mr

lenk
everythings
fine

better
than
its
been
in
a
long
time
wendys
fine
now
ill
give
her
the
message
you
called

and
shell
tell
you
herself
mr

lenk
yes
if
i
dont
hear
from
your
wife
soon

i
will
be
calling
back

do
you
understand
youll
hear
from
her
by
the
end
of
the
day
its
my
husband
ben

they
cant
all
be
psychotic
what
if
what
theyre
saying
is
real
have
you
noticed
anything
he
seems
a
little
disconnected
hey

carly

i
thought
you
might
like
some
tea
its
new
now

the
best
way
i
can
describe
the
sample
that
you
brought
me
is
a
kind
of
postinfection
sweat

like
a
night
sweat
only

instead
of
evaporating

this
solidified
a
percentage
is
spent
white
blood
cells

like
youd
find
in
any
normal
infection
but

then

another
percentage
is
hormones
a
body
produces
when
it
enters
rem
sleep
suggesting
that
the
hormones
acted
as
a
catalyst
in
some
kind
of
metabolic
reaction

and
then
were
expelled
as
waste
yeah

but
a
reaction
to
what
a
reaction
to
these
these
are
also
spent
cells

exploded

actually
are
they
viral
virallike

but
larger
than
any
virus
known
now

i
tried
to
destroy
some
of
them
i
heated
them
up
to
see
when
theyd
incinerate

took
them
up
to

degrees
they
survived
well

thats
impossible

yeah
remember
ted
fraddo
hes
out
at
the
lab
at
fort
detrick
now
a
complete

intelligent
entity

the
dimensions
of
a
few
cells
thats
invading
peoples
bodies

integrating
their
dna
and
reprogramming
their
genetic
expression
reprogramming
how
how
would
that
look
eighty
percent
of
what
we
are
is
determined
by
our
genetic
expression
integration
of
alien
dna
could
look
like
anything
or
nothing
at
all
so
you
say
that
this
is
showing
up
all
over
its
starting
to
they
began
considering
epidemic
protocols
in
europe
last
night

japan

we
know
if
weve
got
it
inside

thats
one
of
my
patients
would
you
let
go
of
me
she
was
saying
she
slept

did
you
hear
her
so
if
she
slept
and
she
were
infected

that
would
mean
she
was
immune
possibly

there
might
be
something
in
her
medical
records
do
you
keep
them
in
your
office
are
you
still
requesting
backup
for
a
traffic
stop
at

yes

dispatcher

weve
got


we

backup
as
soon
as
you
can

over
copy



eta
five
minutes
all
units

please
be
advised

inoculations
have
begun
scout


see
the
national
guard
commander
at
th
street
to
assist
in
crowd
control
copy

eta
five
minutes
heres
what
i
have

gp

notes
should
be
in
there

im
gonna
check
the
computer
i
think
her
husband
transformed
very
early
what
kind
of
medication
was
she
on
she
was
on
buspar
and
clonazepam
and
i
recently
prescribed
risperdal
oh

jesus

how
ridiculous
her
husbands
infected
with
an
alien
virus

and
i
prescribe
an
antipsychotic
yeah

well

i
thought
that
sample
you
brought
me
was
a
halloween
gag
so
whos
to
know
thats
interesting

she
had
encephalitis
when
she
was
a
child
yeah

it
almost
killed
her

it
onset
as
a
varicella
complication
her
sister
gave
her
the
chickenpox

it
might
not
be
normal
encephalitis
it
could
be
the
reason
why
the
virus
hasnt
been
able
to
attack
her
system
well

we
need
to
find
her
are
you
all
right
three
years
ago
oliver
got
the
chickenpox
hed
had
his
shots

middle
of
it

he
had
horrible
dreams
his
temperature
skyrocketed

he
was
hallucinating
i
took
him
to
the
hospital

they
diagnosed
him
with
adem
do
you

ollie
might
be
immune
its
a
possibility
hes
been
at
tuckers
for
two
nights

could
be
the
reason
why
what

clear
scientists
are
reporting
that
identifying
the
immunity
gene
is
the
first
step
in
creating
a
cure
to
the
pandemic
survivors
are
using
every
means
to
spread
the
vaccine
to
as
many
people
as
possible

food
and
water
supplies
pockets
of
the
immune
began
to
grow
across
the
country
retaking
control
of
major
cities
on
the
anniversary
of
the
space
shuttle
patriot
disaster
leading
scientists
convened
in
washington
today
to
update
the
president
on
the
continued
efforts
to
eradicate
the
global
pandemic
dr

galeano
is
this
the
final
word
the
virus

will
it
spread
again
the
situations
under
control
inoculation
centers
throughout
the
globe
are
experiencing
success
in
curing
and
immunizing
their
populations
why
was
it
so
easy
to
cure
the
alien
virus
has
no
real
defense
system
once
we
isolated
the
vaccine

the
result
was
inevitable
how
many
people
are
still
infected
were
unsure

but
the
number
is
shrinking

what
about
memory
loss
we
believe
that
the
way
the
entity
plugged
itself
into
our
brain
was
so
different
from
how
were
wired
that
the
mind
interpreted
the
experience
as
unconsciousness
which
explains
why
the
cured
have
no
recollection
of
recent
events
over
the
alien
virus
has
it
been
eradicated
well

pick
up
a
newspaper

better

stupidity
that
pushes
them
to
be
evil
it
will
prevent
you
from
answering
to
their
nastiness
because
theres
nothing
worse
than
bitterness
and
vengeance

worthy
and
true
to
yourself

i
imagined
after
a
few
days
at
my
mothers
friend
home
she
decided
that
their
apartment
was
too
small
to
accomodate
me
she
found
me
a
bed
and
board
where
i
would
be
very
well
according
to
her
i
was
finding
shelves
of
products
that
no
longer
existed
in
my
country
for
a
while
going
to
the
supermarket
was
my
favorite
pastime
favorite
pastime
favorite
pastime
anyway
it
was
urgent
that
i
make
some
new
friends
at
the
french
school

i
could
understand
the
others
and
be
understood
do
you
have
a
smoke
quickly

the
school
dropouts
were
interested
in
me
my
nationality
and
my
history
were
fascinating
them
you
saw
a
revolution
and
a
war
yeah

did
you
see
many
dead
people
err
a
few
terrific
i
was
soon
a
member
of
the
band
with
momo

i
discovered
nonchalance
a
forced
nihilism
concept
and
the
alternative
vienna
life
i
admit
that
at
the
beginning
it
was
a
little
difficult
and
after
all

why
not
i
was
trying
to
convince
myself
that
i
had
found
my
place
but
i
remained
different
holidays
were
sure
to
remind
me
of
it
shit

christmas

my
whole
family

the
beginning
of
a
series
of
moves
i

and
her
mother
took
me
in
after

good
people
i
decided
to
become
integrated
during
the
next
year
but
sometimes

western
culture
remained
a
mistery
i
had
to
improve
my
knowledge
from
sartre
to
bakounin

from
zweig
to
freud
i
read
everything
i
could
but
i
understood
that
some
things
would
be
beyond
me
forever
did

see
this
fat
pig
waldheim
has
been
elected
i
want
to
puke

hot
air
life
is
empty

man
realizes
it

creates
games
for
ruler

bullshit
life
isnt
absurd
people
give
their
life
for
freedom

couldnt
let
go
this
feeling
of
guilt
i

the
time
of
change
was
coming

cynical
game
years
of
war
for
nothing
a
million

nothing
the
last
days
had
been
horrifying
a
month
before
the
armistice

irak
bombed
teheran
on
a
daily
basis
as
if
it
had
to
be
wiped
out
from
the
map
just
before
the
ceasefire
the
government
got
scared
because
some
opponents
had
fled
to
iran
so
the
state
decided
to
put
an
end
to
it
the
hard
way
they
proposed
to
the
convicts
to
renounce
their
ideals

to
promise
to
be
loyal
to
the
regime
and
to
serve
their
sentence
or
to
be
executed
most
of
them
were
executed
thats
it
thats
all
thats
left
to
famillies

street
names

in
teheran

cemetery

fuck
it
wherever
we
stand

we
always
see
the
same
thing
anatomy
lesson
my
ass
the
only
thing
sticking
out
is
her
big
nose
go
to
the
central
university
immediately
all
the
absentees
will
be
suspended
for

weeks
we
must
behave
correctly
the
flowers
of
the
revolution
grew
from
the
blood
of
our
martyrs
to
have
an
indecent
behavior
is
like
trampling
on
the
blood
of
the
martyrs
so

im
asking
to
all
young
ladies
to
wear
tighter
trousers
and
longer
cowls
they
must
cover
their
hair
and
must
not
use
any
makeup
does
anybody
have
a
question
if
not

the
session
is
ended

yes
our
cowls
are
short

our
trousers
are
indecent
we
put
on
a
lot
of
makeup

etc
i
spend
a
lot
of
time
at
the
workshop
a
longer
cowl
makes
it
difficult
our
trousers
efficiently
hide
our
shapes
knowing
that
those
trousers
are
in
fashion
is
the
religion
defending
our
integrity
or
is
it
simply
opposed
to
fashion
have
many
different
clothes
and
hair
cuts
sometimes

we
can
even
see
their
underwears
why
is
it
that
as
a
woman
im
not
allowed
to
feel
anything
when
watching
them
its
great

its
as
if
you
had
cut
their
little
dick
take
off
this
fucking
cowl

it
makes
me
claustrophobic
i
tend
to
forget
it
dont
ever
forget
it
its
fear
that
makes
us
lose
our
selfawareness
its
also
changing
us
into
cowards
you
had
guts
im
proud
of
you
i
want
to
leave

to
go
where
to
the
usa
or
to
europe
where
in
europe
i
cant
stand
living
here
any
longer
youll
come
with
me
i
dont
want
to
leave

thats
because
youre
still
nostalgic
sooner
or
later

people
will
disgust
you
you
can
die
in
the
west

nobody
cares
well
manage
whats
your
relationship

your
parents

employer

we
work
for
the
umbrella
corporation
the
mansion
above
is
an
emergency
entance
to
the
hive
you
were
security
operatives
placed
three
to
protect
that
entrance
your
marriage
is
a
fake
just
your
cover
to
protect
the
secrecy
of
the
hive
and
what
is
the
hive
accessing
schematic
of
the
hive
raccoon
city

nearest
urban
center
the
mansion

where
we
found
you
and
gained
access
to
the
train
which

in
turn

brought
us
to
the
hive
the
hive
is
located
underground
deep
beneath
the
streets
of
raccoon
city
a
secret
research
facility
owned
and
operated
by
the
umbrella
corporation
the
hive
houses
over

technicians

scientists
and
support
staff
they
live
and
work
underground
their
research
is
of
the
highest
importance
its
nature
is
classified
our
position
on
the
map
is
indicated
by
heat
signature
why
cant
i
remembe
anything
the
hive
has
its
own
defense
mechanisms

all
computercontrolled
a
nerve
gas
was
released
into
the
house
primary
effect
of
the
gas
complete
unconsciousness
lasting
up
to
four
hours
secondary
effects
can
include
acute
memory
loss
for
how
long
subjective

an
hour

day

week
so

this
place
was
attacked
im
afraid
things
are
a
little
more
complicated
than
that
sir

weve
breached
the
hive
jd
halon
has
dissipated
easier
to
work
undeground

thinking
theres
a
view
looks
like
were
taking
the
stairs
status
red
queens
locked
on
to
us

she
knows
were
here
whos
the
red
queen
stateoftheart
artificial
intelligence
the
computer
that
controls
the
hive
this
will
slow
us
down
our
route
to
the
queen
takes
us
straight
through
these
labs
rain

jd


see
how
bad
the
flooding
is
kaplan

find
an
alternate
route
five
hours
ago

red
queen
went
homicidal
sealed
the
hive
and
killed
everyone
here
when
we
realized
what
happened

we
were
dispatched
to
shut
her
down
why
did
she
do
it
we
dont
know

outside
interference
is
a
possibility
no

im

cold
in
here
are
you
do
you
remember
anything
from
before
this
no

nothing
before
the
train

time

double
back

through
dining
hall
b

right
on
track

all
the
people

that

in
when
you
cut
the
power

you
unlocked
the
doors

you
let
them
out
were
never
gonna
make
it
to
the
surface
you
are
security
operatives
placed
there
to
protect
that
entrance
ive
got
one
in
the
breech

and
an
extra
mag
i
can
help
you
get
the
virus

i
have
access
to
security
codes
but
there
will
be
a
price

name
it
who
was
she
my
sister
corporations
like
umbrella
think
theyre
above
the
law
but
theyre
not
there
are
hundreds
of
thousands
of
us
who
think
the
same
all
over
the
world
some
of
us
provide
information
others
give
their
support
some
take
more
direct
action
if
your
friends
had
been
more
thorough
they
wouldve
seen
through
my
false
id
then
all
the
red
flags
wouldve
gone
off
theres
no
way
i
couldve
infiltrated
the
hive
so
you
sent
your
sister
we
needed
something
concrete
anything
to
expose
umbrella
to
the
press
proof
of
the
research
going
on
down
here
what
kind
of
research
the
illegal
kind
genetic
viral
my
sister
was
going
to
smuggle
out
a
sample
of
the
virus
they
were
developing
how
was
she
going
to
make
it
out
she
had
a
contact
within
the
hive

someone
i
never
met
they
had
access
to
security
codes

surveillance

every
thing
she
needed
so
why
didnt
she
make
it
maybe
she
trusted
the
wrong
person
maybe
they
set
her
up
kept
the
virus
fo
themselves
do
you
have
any
idea
what
the
tvirus
would
be
worth
on
the
open
market
worth
all
this
to
someone
dont
shoot
close
that
door
theyre
right
behind
us
close
that
door
son
of
a
bitch
right
behind
us

about
this
door
theye
waiting
there
too
and
that

dead
end

theres
no
way

of
the
queens
chamber
so
we
wait

someone
doesnt
hear
fom

we
dont
have
much
time

those
blast
doors
we
passed
on
the
way
in
from
the
mansion

they
seal
shut
in
under
an
hour
if
were
not
out
by
then

were
not
getting
out
what
are
you
talking
about
they
cant
just
bury
us
alive
down
here
containing
the
incident
is
the
only
failsafe
plan
they
had
against
possible
contamination
and
youre
telling
us
this
now

when
were
trapped
half
a
mile
underground
we
have
to
find
a
way
out
of
this
room
where
are
you
taking
those
im
turning
her
back
on
thats
not
a
good
idea

shell
know
a
way
out
of
here
that
homicidal
bitch
killed
my
team
that
homicidal
bitch
may
be
our
only
way
out
of
here
im
sure
shes
real
happy
to
help
us
out
that
circuit
breaker
you
were
talking
about

can
you
bypass
it
yeah
so
do
it
cicuit
breakers
disabled
this
time

if
i
hit
the
switch

she
wont
shut
down

shell
fry
there
you
are
things

i
gather

have
gone
out
of
control
give
me
that
switch
right
now

ill
fry
your
ass
i
did
warn
you

didnt
i
tell
us
whats
going
on
down
here

research
and
development
what
about
the
tvius
the
tvirus
was
a
major
medical
breakthrough
although
it
clearly
also
possessed
highly
profitable
military
applications
how
does
it
explain
those
things
out
there
even
in
death

the
human
body
remains
active
hair
and
fingernails
continue
to
grow
new
cells
are
produced
and
the
brain
holds
a
small
electrical
charge
that
takes
months
to
dissipate
the
tvirus
provides
a
massive
jolt

both
to
cellular
growth
and
to
those
trace
electrical
impulses
put
quite
simply

it
reanimates
the
body
it
brings
the
dead
back
to
life
not
fully

the
subjects
have
the
simplest
of
motor
functions
perhaps
a
little
memory

virtually
no
intelligence
they
are
driven
by
the
basest
of
impulses

the
most
basic
of
needs
which
is
the
need
to
feed
how
do
you
kill
them
severing
the
top
of
the
spinal
column
or
massive
trauma
to
the
brain
are
the
most
effective
methods
you
mean
shoot
them
in
the
head
why
did
you
kill
every
body
down
here
the
tvirus
escaped
into
the
air
conditioning
system
and
an
uncontrolled
pattern
of
infection
began
the
virus
is
protean
changing
from
liquid
to
airborne
to
blood
transmission
i
couldnt
allow
it
to
escape
from
the
hive
so

i
took
steps
steps
you
must
understand
those
who
become
infected

i
cant
allow
you
to
leave
were
not
infected

just
one
bite
one
scratch
from
these
creatures
is
sufficient
and
then
you
become
one
of
them
a
check
of
my
systems
indicates
my
main
drive
circuit
breaker
has
been
disabled
may
i
ask
why
insurance

we
need
a
way
out
of
here
if
you
refuse
to
help

we
flip
the
switch
understand
after
you
what
the
hell
is
this
place
the
utility
tunnels
they
run
underneath
the
hive
fo
wate

gas
and
power
lines
been
in
here
before

keep
moving
going
ound
in
circles

this
is
the
route
the
computer
gave
i
dont
know
why
you
listen
to
her

enough
we
have
no
choice
but
to
keep
moving
because
those
things
are
behind
us

got
it
that
mesh
wont
hold

keep
moving
hold
it
theres
too
many
of
them
up
on
the
pipes

up
on
the
pipes
quickly

everyone

up
on
the
pipes
lets
go
come
on

theres
a
way
up
keep
them
back
go
on
up

move
it
get
over
here

theres
too
many
of
them
i
can
manage
jd
we
have
to
do
something
about
your
wounds
im
fine
you
like
that

dont
you
you
like
the
way
it
tastes

you
like
the
taste

arm

my
shoulder
ready
here

when
i

out
of
here
i
think
ill
get
laid
you
might
want
to
clean
up
first
wait
blue
for
the
virus

green
for
the
antivirus
theres
a
cure

what
are
you
talking
about
theres
a
cure
the
process
can
be
reversed
theres
a
cure
youll
be
okay
i
was
beginning
to
worry
this
is
where
they
kept
the
tvirus
how
do
you
know
all
this
because
i
was
going
to
steal
it
you
betrayed
her

i
dont
know
you
caused
all
this

i
cant
remember
the
truth

i
dont
remember
the
truth
its
gone
its
gone

its
not
there
i
just
cant

its
over
i
can
help
you
get
the
virus

i
have
access
to
security
codes
but
theres
a
price
you
have
to
guarantee
me
that
youll
bring
this
corporation
down
today
all
your
dreams
come
true
we
can
still
make
it
out
of
here
we
can
have
everything
weve
ever
wanted
moneys
out
there
waiting
you
wouldnt
believe
how
much
is
that
how
you
thought
all
my
dreams
would
come
true
i
wouldnt
want
to
shoot
you
might
need
the
bullets
i
wont
take
any
part
in
this
okay

but
you
cant
just
wash
your
hands
of
this
we
work
for
the
same
company

you
knew
what
they
did
i
was
trying
to
stop
them
you
really
believe
that
people
like
him
will
ever
change
anything
changes
the
antivirus
its
on
the
train
where
you
found
me
couldnt
have
been
standing
more
than
there
feet
from
it
i
so
nearly
made
it
out
i
didnt
realize
that
bitch
of
a
computer
in
or
out
or
out
i
dont
know
what
we
had
but
its
over
your
boyfriends
a
real
asshole
he
shot
the
locking
mechanism
out
i
cant
believe
that
son
of
a
bitch
is
going
to
get
away
with
this
i
dont
think
so
ive
been
a
bad

bad
girl
what
the
fuck
is
that
one
of
the
hives
early
experiments
produced
by
injecting
the
virus
directly
into
living
tissue
the
results
were
unstable
now
that
it
has
fed
on
fresh
dna
it
will
mutate
becoming
a
stronger

faster
hunter
if
you
knew
it
was
loose

why
didnt
you
warn
us
because
she
was
saving
it
for
us

isnt
that
right
i
didnt
think
any
of
you
would
make
it
this
far
not
without
infection
why
didnt
you
tell
us
about
the
antivirus
this
long
after
infection

theres
no
guarantee
it
would
work
but
theres
a
chance
i
dont
deal
in
chance
no
pressure

guys
you
require
the
fourdigit
access
code
i
can
give
you
the
code

but
first

you
must
do
something
for
me
one
of
your
group
is
infected

i
require
her
life
for
the
code
the
antivius
is
right
there
on
the
platfom
im
sorry

but
its
a
risk
i
cannot
take
shes
right

its
the
only
way
youll
have
to
kill
me
otherwise

we
all
die
down
here
the
glass
is
reinforced

but
it
wont
hold
forever
do
it
get
up

just
do
it
please

do
it
you
dont
have
long
to
decide
you
have
no
choice

kill
her
now
get
off
you
dont
have
any
choice
just
do
it
now
i
cant
kill
her

the
time
comes

miss
briony

dinner
for

to
prepare
hello

a
play

who

you
jungle
drums
will
you
come

why

you

stupendous

darling

the
trials
of
arabella

by
briony
tallis
cee

yes
what
do
you
think
it
would
feel
like
to
be
someone
else
im
worried
about
the
play

im
sure
its
a
masterpiece
but
we
only
have
the
afternoon
to
rehearse

what
if
the
twins
cant
act
you
have
to
be
nice
to
them

i
wonder
howd
you
feel
if
your
mother
had
run
off
with
mr
whatshisname
who
reads
the
news
on
the
wireless
perhaps
i
should
have
written
leon
a
story
if
you
write
a
story

you
only
have
to
say
the
word
castle

and
you
could
see
the
towers
and
the
woods
and
the
village
below

but
in
a
play

its
it
all
depends
on
other
people
cee

yes
why
dont
you
talk
to
robbie
any
more
i
do

we
just
move
in
different
circles

thats
all
do
we
have
to
do
a
play
why
do
we
have
to
its
to
celebrate
my
brother
leons
visit

i
hate
plays
so
do
i

how
can
you
hate
plays
its
just
showing
off

youll
be
in
this
play
or
youll
get
a
clout
and
ill
tell
the
parents

youre
not

amenable

right
now

briony

whats
your
play
about

about

to
be
sensible
i
suppose
youre
going
to

in
that
case

do
you
mind
if
i

the
first
decent
thing
to
happen

to
be
arabella

be
the
director

you
very
much

much
more
passionate
leons
coming

i
heard
a
rumour
hes

a
friend

paul
marshall

the
chocolate
millionaire

the
flowers
for
him
why
shouldnt
they
be
leon
says
hes
very
charming
the
old
man
telephoned
last
night

he
says
youre
planning
on
being
a
doctor
im
thinking
about
it

yes

another
six
years
of
student
life
how
else
do
you
become
a
doctor
you
could
get
a
fellowship

now
couldnt
you
with
your
first
i
dont
want
to
teach
i
said
id
pay
your
father
back
thats
not
what
i
meant
at
all
let
me
help
with
that

no

im
all
right

thanks
take
the
flowers

take
the
flowers

im
all
right

im
all
right
oh

you
idiot
do
you
realise
thats
probably
the
most
valuable
thing
we
own
not
any
more

it
isnt
hello

robbie
no
need
to
encourage
him
cee
where
is
everyone

danny
i
dont
know

sir
sir

gasping
for
a
drink
will
you
have
one
rather
whisky
please
leon
here
she
is
oh

ive
missed
you

ive
been
going
completely
doolally
up
here
this
is
my
sister

cecilia

paul
marshall

ive
heard
an
awful
lot
about
you
likewise

where
are
we
putting
him
in
the
blue
room

mothers
lying
down

shes
got
one
of
her
migraines
im
not
surprised

with
this
heat
its
the
big
room
next
to
the
nursery
is
the
old
man
staying
in
town
looks
like
it

some
sort
of
rush
on
at
the
ministry
so
arent
we
doing
the
play
no
why
not
dont
ask
me
i
dont
like
it
here
theres
always
a
problem
when
a
new
brand
comes
about
the
remarketing

the
repackaging

the
reshaping
even
the
reflavouring
in
some
cases

or
whole
new
technology
i
think
our
main
challenge
is
whether
or
not
to
launch
the
new
amo
bar
the
army
amo

do
you
see
pass
the
amo
my
source
at
the
ministry
is
very
reliable
i
used
to
clean
his
shoes
at
harrow

informs
me
we
have
a
good
chance
of
including
it
in
the
standard
issue
ration
pack
which
means
that
id
have
to
open
at
least
three
more
factories
more
if
they
bring
in
conscription

which
i
say
is
bound
to
happen
if
herr
hitler
doesnt
pipe
down
hes
about
as
likely
to
do
that
as
buy
shares
this
isnt
very
good

i
make
a
cocktail
with
crushed
ice
rum
and
melted
dark
chocolate

its
absolutely
scrumptious
guess
who
we
met
on
the
way
in
robbie
i
told
him
to
join
us
tonight

oh

leon

you
didnt
so

robbie

the
housekeepers
son

whose
father
did
a
bunk

years
ago
gets
a
scholarship
to
the
local
grammar

the
old
man
puts
him
through
cambridge
goes
up
at
the
same
time
as
cee

and
for
three
years
she
hardly
speaks
to
him
anyone
got
a
cigarette
i
dont
know
what
the
hell
hes
doing
these
days

messing
about
in
flower
beds
as
a
matter
of
fact

hes
planning
on
doing
a
medical
degree
and
the
old
man
said
yes
to
that
look

i
really
think
you
should
go
down
to
the
lodge
and
ask
him
not
to
come
why
has
something
happened
between
you
when
can
we
go
home
soon
we
cant
go
home

its
a
divorce
how
dare
you
say
that
well

its
true
you
will
never

ever
use
that
word
again
do
you
understand
now
what
are
we
going
to
do
im
always
asking
myself
that
my
name
is
paul
marshall

you
must
be
the
cousins
from
the
north
what
are
your
names
pierrot
jackson

what
marvellous
names
do
you
know
our
parents
well

ive
read
about
them
in
the
paper

usual
sort
of
nonsense

thank
you

about
this
in
front
of
the
children
your
parents

absolutely
wonderful
people
thats
quite
clear

and
they
love
you
and
think
about
you
all
the
time
jolly
nice
slacks

went
to
see
a
show
and
i
got
them
at
libertys
what
was
the
show
hamlet

to
be
or
not
to
be
i
like
your
shoes
duckers
in
the
turl

they
make
a
wooden
thing

shaped
like
your
foot
keep
it
forever
im
starving

whens

well

i
might
be
able
to
help
you
there

if
you
can
guess
what
i
do
for
a
living
youve
got
a
chocolate
factory

everyone
knows
that
then
it
wasnt
a
guess

was
it
therell
be
one
of
these
in
every
kit
bag
of
every
soldier
in
the
british
army
sugar
casing

so
it
wont
melt
why

be
fighting

their
country
our
daddy
says
there

going
to
be
a
war
your
daddy

have
to
give
it
to
your
sister
bite
it
you
have
to
bite
it
briony
the
princess
was
well
aware
of
his
remorseless
wickedness
but
that
made
it
no
easier
to
overcome
the
voluminous
love
she
felt
in
her
heart
for
sir
romulus

the
princess
knew
instinctively
that
the
one
with
red
hair
was
not
to
be
trusted
as
his
young
ward
dived
again
and
again
to
the
depths
of
the
lake
in
search
of
the
enchanted
chalice

sir
romulus
twirled
his
luxuriant
moustache
sir
romulus
rode
with
his
two
companions

northwards

drawing
ever
closer
to
an
effulgent
sea
so
heroic
in
manner

he
appeared
so
valiant
in
word
no
one
could
ever
guess
at
the
darkness
lurking
in
the
black
heart
of
sir
romulus
turnbull
he
was
the
most
dangerous
man
in
the
world
dear
cecilia

i
thought
i
should
write
to
apologise
for
my
clumsy
and
inconsiderate
behaviour
forgive
me
if
i
seem
strange
but
im
robbie
dear
cecilia

youd
be
forgiven
for
thinking
me
mad
the
way
i
acted
this
afternoon
the
truth
is
i
feel
rather
lightheaded
and
foolish
in
your
presence

cee
and
i
dont
think
i
can
blame
the
heat
will
you
forgive
me
robbie
off
out
then
yes

leons
asked
me
to
join
them
for
dinner
so
thats
why
ive
been
polishing
silver
all
afternoon
ill
think
of
you
when
i
see
my
face
in
the
spoon
youre
not
a
bit
like
your
father

not
in
any
way
thats
because
im
all
yours

ill
be
late
your
shirts
are
hanging
upstairs
son

yes
briony
is
that
you
do
you
think
you
could
do
me
a
favour
could
you
run
ahead
and
give
this
to
cee
i
feel
a
bit
of
a
fool
handing
it
over
myself

all
right
briony
i
suppose
hes
what
you
might
call
eligible

rather
he
certainly
seems
to
think
hes
the
cats
pyjamas
which
is
odd

considering
he
has
pubic
hair
growing
out
of
his
ears
i
should
imagine
hed
give
you
a
lot
of
very
noisy

boneheaded
sons
hes
quite
a
good
egg

actually

you
say
that
about
everyone
leon
rummy

if
it
aint
my
little
sis
i
wrote
you
a
play

leon

wanted
to
do
a
play
for
you
the
trials
of
arabella

cecilia
going
to
do
i
dont
know
you
ought
to
call
the
police

he

he
thought
about
it
all

long
all
you
have
to
do
is
show
them
the
letter
you
wont
tell
anyone

a
real
brick
it
was
a
mistake

briony
read
it
my
god

im
so
sorry

it
was
the
wrong
version
it
was
never
meant
to
be
read

no
what
was
in
the
version
i
was
meant
to
read
i
dont

it
was
more
formal

anatomical
yes

been
there
for
weeks

this
morning
by
the
fountain
ive
never
done
anything
like
that
before
and
i
was
so
angry
with
you

and
with
myself
i
thought
if
you
went
away
to
medical
school

then
id
be
happy

but
i
dont
know
how
i
could
have
been
so
ignorant
about
myself

im
talking
about

dont
you
you
knew
before

someones
come
in
people

out
having

parents
that
hot
weather
encouraged
loose
morals
in
high
summer

my
sister

i
were
never
allowed
out
of

they

something
practical
it
says

strategic
withdrawals

work

no
matter
how
long
the
hours
i
cant
escape
from
what
i
did

which
i
am
only

beginning
to
grasp
cee

the
difference
between
right

you
do
you
have
to
be

before
you
can
bring
yourself
to
own

a
lie
there

soldiers
of


old
enough
to
be
left
to
die
by
the
side
of
the
road
did
you
know
that
yes
five
years
ago

you
didnt
care
about
telling
the
truth
you

all
your
family

you
just
assumed
that
for
all
my
education
i
was
still
little
better
than
a
servant

still
not
to
be
trusted
thanks
to
you

they
were
able
to
close
ranks
and
throw
me
to
the
fucking
wolves

look
at
me

some
things
youre
going
to
do
for
us
youll
go
to
your
parents
as
soon
as
you
can
and
youll
tell
them
everything
they

to
be
convinced

false

a
statement

you
saying
you
saw
me
by
the
lake
try
to
include
whatever
you
can
remember
of
what
danny
hardman
was
doing
that
night
hardman
yes
it
wasnt
danny
hardman
it
was
leons
friend

marshall
i
dont
believe
you
hes
married
lola

ive
just
come
from
their
wedding
lola
wont
be
able
to

against
him
now
hes
immune
im
very

very
sorry
for
the
terrible
distress
that
i
have
caused
i
am
very

very
sorry
just
do
as
weve
asked
of
you
write
it
all
down

just
the
truth

no
rhymes

no
embellishments

no
adjectives
and
then
leave
us
be
i
will

i
promise
briony
im
sorry

could
we
stop
for
a
moment
man
of
course

is
something
the
matter
i
just
need
a
couple
of
minutes
by
myself
im
sorry

could
we
stop
for
a
moment
briony
tallis

id
like
to
talk
now
about
your
new
novel

atonement
which
comes
out
in
a
few
days
to
coincide
with
your
birthday
its
your
twentyfirst
novel
its
my
last
novel
oh

really
are
you
retiring
im
dying
my
doctor
tells
me
i
have
something
called
vascular
dementia
which
is
essentially
a
continuous
series
of
tiny
strokes
your
brain
closes
down

gradually
you
lose
words

you
lose
your
memory
which
for
a
writer
is
pretty
much
the
point
so
thats
why
i
could
finally
write
the
book

i
think

i
had
to
and
why

of
course

its
my
last
novel
strangely
enough
it
would
be
just
as
accurate
to
call
it
my
first
novel
i
wrote
several
drafts
as
far
back
as
my
time
at
st
thomas
hospital
during
the
war
i
just
couldnt
ever
find
the
way
to
do
it
because
the
novel
is
autobiographical

is
that
right
yes

entirely

i
havent
changed
any
names

including
my
own
and
was
that
the
problem
i
had

for
a
very
long
time

decided
to
tell
the
absolute
truth
no
rhymes

no
embellishments
and
i
think
youve
read
the
book

youll
understand
why
i
got
firsthand
accounts
of
all
the
events
i
didnt
personally
witness
the
conditions
in
prison

the
evacuation
to
dunkirk

everything
but
the
effect
of
all
this
honesty
was
rather
pitiless
you
see

i
couldnt
any
longer
imagine
what
purpose
would
be
served
by
it
by
what
sorry

served
by
honesty
by
honesty
or
reality
because

in
fact
i
was
too
much
of
a
coward
to
go
and
see
my
sister
in
june
i
never
made
that
journey
to
balham
robbie
do
you
have
any
idea
what
its
like
in
jail
briony
so
the
scene
in
which
i
confess
to
them
is
imagined
briony
invented
robbie
how
old
do
you
have
to
be
to
know
the
difference
between
right
and
wrong
briony
and

in
fact

could
never
have
happened
robbie
turner
died
of
septicaemia
at
braydunes
on
june
the
first
the
last
day
of
the
evacuation
cheerio

pal
and
i
was
never
able
to
put
things
right
with
my
sister

cecilia
because
she
was
killed
on
the
th
of
october
by
the
bomb
that
destroyed
the
gas
and
water
mains
above
balham
tube
station
so
my
sister
and
robbie
were
never
able
to
have
the
time
together
they
both
so
longed
for

and
deserved
and
which

ever
since

ive
ever
since
ive
always
felt
i
prevented
but
what
sense
of
hope
or
satisfaction

could
a
reader
derive
from
an
ending
like
that
so

in
the
book

i
wanted
to
give
robbie
and
cecilia
what
they
lost
out
on
in
life
id
like
to
think
this
isnt
weakness
or
evasion
but
a
final
act
of
kindness
okay

cant
get
that

that
okay

their

here
he
comes
meet
in
public
place
lot
of
people
around

very
wise
and
i
see
you
bring
bodyguards
also
very
wise
when
i
was
in
the
kgb

we
knew
how
to
deal
with
scum
like
you
and
you
did
what
there
now

you
give
me
the
address

what
address
tatianas
family
i
dont
know
what
youre
talking
about
see
you
see
i
told
you
it
would
happen
like
this
i
told
you
this

anna
she
was

read
the
diary
she
was

when
he
raped
her

you
bastards
murdered
her
anger
is
very
dangerous

makes
people
do
stupid
things
please

forget
any
of
this
ever
happened
youre
in
very
wrong
place

anna
ivanovna
you
belong
in
there
with
nice
people
stay
away
from
people
like
me
devil
im
not
sure
i
can
carry
on
another
day
the
windows
wont
open

so
i
cant
throw
myself
out
they
inject
me
every
day
with
heroin
sometimes
i
think
this
is
all
a
hallucination
its
always
good
to
have
someone
who
i
can
trust
to
do
simple
tasks
in
this
business

sometimes
the
biggest
danger
comes
from
the
most
stupid
things
you
cant
afford
to
be
careless
in
any
area
so

what
was
the
lie
soyka
was
spreading
about
my
son
it
was
nothing
important
kirill
had
him
killed
for
nothing
important
i
dont
like
to
repeat
this
for
me

you
will
repeat
it
you
play
with
the
prince
to
do
business
with
the
king
if
you
want
to
do
business
with
me
you
must
be
open
with
me
so
what
was
soyka
saying
about
the
prince
that
hes
a
drunk
and
also
a
queer
my
only
son
you
know

it
never
snows
in
this
city
its
never
hot
london
is
a
city
of
whores
and
queers
i
think
london
is
to
blame
for
what
he
is
why
dont
you
go
home
cold
gets
into
my
bones
also

kgb
would
be
waiting
for
me
fsb
they
are
called
fsb
now
whatever
they
call
them

are
worse

the
kgb

midwife

had
an
uncle
a
russian
so
you
know
what
he

she
said
he
has
read
the
diary
you
cannot
trust
a
russian
with
that
kind
of
information
do
you
understand
me
perhaps
you
can
deal
with
him
i
thought
that

got
stolen
lot
of
villains
around

place
for
kid
to
grow
up
especially
not
little
girl
if
you
want
my
opinion

she
would
be
better
off
in
london
maybe
with
you

why
not
so
youve
read
the
diary
how
can
you
keep
doing
what

and
purity
they
had
a
special
place
for

people
who

to
help
alessa
was
so
lonely
and
hurt
and
scared
they

than
to
hurt
her
so
badly
when
youre
hurt
and
scared
for
so
long
your
fear
and
pain
turn
to
hate
and
the
hate
starts
to
change
the
world
alessa
s
hate
grew
and
grew

burning
inside
her
her
hate
got
so

miyuki
lets
begin
with
the
first
incident
three
years
ago
your
colleagues
were
the
primary
investigators
on
that
case
its
my
understanding
that
these
colleagues
have
since
disappeared
a
mother
and
the
child
were
killed
in
that
house
the
husband
murdered
them

i
have
questions
about
the
incident
happened
as
reported
in
the
local
papers
recently
an
american
family
died
in
that
house
also
under
suspicious
circumstances
i
cannot
get
into
those
details
so

two
incidents
two
families
died
in
one
house
the
cops
said
you
were
the
one
that
pulled
my
sister
out
of
the
fire
im
sorry
about
your
sister
i
know
why
your
sister
did
what

her
boyfriend

michael

is
that
we

you
do
this
to
me
why
did
you
take
me
to
that
place
you

kayako
kept
this
journal
her
whole
life
she
was
only
eight
when
she
wrote
this
part
i
dont
understand
it

but
it
looks
creepy
as
hell
its
not
creepy

its
sad
apparently

her
mother
was
an
itako
itako
what
is
that
its
a
kind
of
channeler
people
believe
they
can
talk
with
deceased
loved
ones
through
them
but
i
dont
understand
this
part
i
have
a
friend

hes
really
into
folklore

i
think
he
can
help
us
this
is
not
itako
this
person
who
is
written
in
diary
did
channeler

but
i
cant
say
this
is
channeler
exactly
i
mean

something
he
says
what
kayako
wrote
was
about
the
rituals
her
mother
performed
and
how
they
were
somewhat
abnormal
i
cant
explain
it
in
english
shaman
exorcist
it
must
be
named
exorcist
theres
no
real
word
to
describe
it
in
english

but
the
closest
thing
would
be
exorcist
she
did
this
to
her
daughter
take
demon
away
from
peoples
mind
or
body
what
is
it
she
let
daughter
eat
eason
demon
everyday
ive
never
heard
about
it
it
it
sounds
like
her
mother
was
able
to
cure
people
through
extracting
evil
spirits
out
of
their
bodies
and
feeding
them
to
her
daughter
first
thing
tomorrow

him
he

endured
the
worst
tortures

later

they
decided
to
send
me
abroad
since
i
had
studied
at
the
french
school
in
teheran
id
go
to
the
french
school
in
vienna

my
father
managed
to
get
me
a
visa
my
mothers
best
friend
was
supposed
to
take
me
in
the
day
before
my
departure

grandma
came
to
sleep
at
home
every
morning
she
put
jasmine
flowers
in
her
bra
when
she
was
taking
it
off

the
flowers
were
falling
from
her
tits
it
was
magic
how
do
you
manage
to
have
such
round
tits
at
your
age
everyday
i
put
them
for

minutes
in
an
icy
water
bowl
ill
come
and
see
you
im
gonna
give
you
an
advice
that
will
always
be
useful
in
your
life

youll
meet
a
lot
of
assholes
remember
that
its
stupidity
that
pushes
them
to
be
evil
it
will
prevent
you
from
answering
to
their
nastiness
because
theres
nothing
worse
than
bitterness
and
vengeance
always
remain
worthy
and
true
to
yourself
youll
see

everything
will
be
all
right
no
tears

think
about
your
future
europe
is
opening
to
you
when
youll
arrive
in
vienna

a
sachertorte

a
delicious
chocolate
cake

you

a
grown
up

no
tears
daddy
enough
never
forget
who
you
are
and
where
youre
coming
from
mom
my
little
marji
europe
opened
itself
to
me

but
not
like
i
imagined
after
a
few
days
at
my
mothers
friend
home
she
decided
that
their
apartment
was
too
small
to
accomodate
me
she
found
me
a
bed
and
board
where
i
would
be
very
well
according
to
her
i
was
finding
shelves
of
products
that
no
longer
existed
in
my
country
for
a
while
going
to
the
supermarket
was
my
favorite
pastime
favorite
pastime
anyway
it
was
urgent
that
i
make
some
new
friends
at
the
french
school

i
could
understand
the
others
and
be
understood
do
you
have
a
smoke
quickly

the
school
dropouts
were
interested
in
me
there
was
momo

thierry

olivier
and
eve
my
nationality
and
my
history
were
fascinating
them
you
saw
a
revolution
and
a
war
yeah

did
you
see
many
dead
people
err
a
few
terrific
i
was
soon
a
member
of
the
band
with
momo

i
discovered
nonchalance
a
forced
nihilism
concept
and
the
alternative
vienna
life
i
admit
that
at
the
beginning
it
was
a
little
difficult
and
after
all

why
not
i
was
trying
to
convince
myself
that
i
had
found
my
place
but
i
remained
different
holidays
were
sure
to
remind
me
of
it
shit

christmas
again
ill
have
to
see
my
whole
family
all
this
because
of
an
american
invention

a
cocacola
mascot

a
saucepan
so
its
true

iranians

it
true
that
you
were
all
prostitutes
it
was
the
beginning
of
a
series
of
moves
i
was
flying
from
apartment
to
apartment
eve
and
her
mother
took
me
in
after
that
i
was
living
with

homosexuals

i
was
living
in
a
maid
room
then
at
some
friends
home
and
at
some
friends
of
some
friends
home

finally
end
in
frau
doktor
schloss
villa

retired
philosophy

sixth
sense

people
i
decided
to
become
integrated
during
the
next
year
but
sometimes

western
culture
remained
a
mistery
ja
voll
ja
voll
i
had
to
improve
my
knowledge
from
sartre
to
bakounin

from
zweig
to
freud
i
read
everything
i
could
but
i
understood
that
some
things
would
be
beyond
me
forever
did
you
see
this
fat
pig
waldheim
has
been
elected
i
want
to
puke

this
is
hot
air
life
is
empty
when
man
realizes
it
he
creates
games
for
ruler
and
bullshit
life
isnt
absurd
people
give
their
life
for
freedom
my
uncle

my
feeling
of
disarray
was
immense
i
was
safe
here
while
my
kins
were
enduring
the
war
i
couldnt
let
go
this
feeling
of
guilt
i
wanted
to
live
like
a
girl
of
my
age
the
time
of
change
was
coming
within
a
few
months

i
became
a
young
woman

a
time

endlessly
repeating
ugliness

my
face
changed
my
face
got
longer

my
right
eye
got
bigger

followed
by
my
chin

my
left
foot
my
nose

three
time
bigger

breast

my
buttocks

centre
of
gravity

i
saw
the
alborz
mountains
again

it
had
been
snowing
my
father
was
wondering
if
he
had
to
put
the
snow
chains
on
his
car
we
took
the
breakfast
together

as
before
my
mother
had
prepared
my
favorite
omelette
nothing
had
changed

and
yet

i
knew
that
nothing
would
be
like
before

we
talked
about
many
things
my
parents
kept
their
word
and
didnt
ask
me
any
question
i
didnt
feel
very
comfortable
but
i
thought
that
the
nightmare
was
behind
us
the
future
might
get
brighter
once
the
war
will
be
over
the
war
is
over
for

forgot
why
theres
been

years
of
war
let
her
breath
no

no

mom

its
all
right
the
west
sold
weapons
to
both
sides
we
had
been
stupid
enough
to
enter
this
cynical
game
years
of
war
for
nothing
a
million
dead
for
nothing
the
last
days
had
been
horrifying
a
month
before
the
armistice

irak
bombed
teheran
on
a
daily
basis
as
if
it
had
to
be
wiped
out
from
the
map
just
before
the
ceasefire
the
government
got
scared
because
some
opponents
had
fled
to
iran
the
government
was
afraid
of
the
threat
that
represented
the
thousands
of
political
prisoners
so
the
state
decided
to
put
an
end
to
it
the
hard
way
they
proposed
to
the
convicts
to
renounce
their
ideals

to
promise
to
be
loyal
to
the
regime
and
to
serve
their
sentence
or
to
be
executed
most
of
them
were
executed
thats
it
now
streets
are
named
after
martyrs
thats
all
thats
left
to
famillies

street
names
when
you
walk
in
teheran
its
like
being
in
a
cemetery

really
grown

catch
the
balls

pretend
to
be
a
little
defenseless
girl

swear

on
my
mother

did
they

with
the
guy

think
that
youre
a
fucking
slut
thats
what
i
think
i
had
no
other
choice
yes

you
had
everybody
has
a
choice
everybody
always
has
a
choice
your
grandfather
went
to
prison
for
protecting
innocents
and
your
uncle
anouche
did
you
forget
why
he
died
what
did
i
teach
you
intergrity
does
this
word
ring
a
bell

miss
shame
on
you
the
lady
with
the
bag
stop
running
the
lady
with
the
bag
stop
running
hey
stop
running
madam

why
are
you
running
you
must
not
run
like
that
when
youre
running

your
behind
makes
indecent
moves
then
dont
look
at
my
ass
fuck
it
wherever
we
stand

we
always
see
the
same
thing
anatomy
lesson
my
ass
the
only
thing
sticking
out
is
her
big
nose
go
to
the
central
university
immediately
all
the
absentees
will
be
suspended
for

weeks
we
must
behave
correctly
the
flowers
of
the
revolution
grew
from
the
blood
of
our
martyrs
to
have
an
indecent
behavior
is
like
trampling
on
the
blood
of
the
martyrs
so

im
asking
to
all
young
ladies
to
wear
tighter
trousers
and
longer
cowls
they
must
cover
their
hair
and
must
not
use
any
makeup
does
anybody
have
a
question
if
not

the
session
is
ended

yes
our
cowls
are
short

our
trousers
are
indecent
we
put
on
a
lot
of
makeup

etc
i
spend
a
lot
of
time
at
the
workshop
i
need
to
be
able
to
move
freely
to
draw
a
longer
cowl
makes
it
difficult
our
trousers
efficiently
hide
our
shapes
knowing
that
those
trousers
are
in
fashion
is
the
religion
defending
our
integrity
or
is
it
simply
opposed
to
fashion
you
make
comments
about
us
while
the
brothers
have
many
different
clothes
and
hair
cuts
sometimes

we
can
even
see
their
underwears
why
is
it
that
as
a
woman
im
not
allowed
to
feel
anything
when
watching
them
while
men
can
get
excited
on
our
shorter
cowls
its
great

its
as
if
you
had
cut
their
little
dick
take
off
this
fucking
cowl

it
makes
me
claustrophobic
i
tend
to
forget
it
dont
ever
forget
it
its
fear
that
makes
us
lose
our
selfawareness
its
also
changing
us
into
cowards
you
had
guts
im
proud
of
you
i
want
to
leave

to
go
where
to
the
usa
or
to
europe
where
in
europe
i
cant
stand
living
here
any
longer
what
about
us

come
with
me

dont
want
to
leave

because
youre
still
nostalgic

or
later

die
in
the
west

nobody
cares
well

that
a

funny
seeing
everything
from
the
side
like
this
l
seem
to
recognize
you
did
we
smoke
our
first
cigarette
together
but
if
l
say
amalfi

a
summer
day

years
ago
our
parents
had
cottages
next
door
to
each
other
you
had
an
older
sister
called
let
me
see
rebecca

right
do
you
mind
letting
me
by
l�m
in
a
hurry
why

of
courseabel
rosenberg
soget
off
the
chair
and
get
your
wet
jacket
off
and
l�ll
make
you
some
real
tea
nice
and
hot
that�ll
do
you
good
lt�s
only
the
man
that
changes
the
toilet
cans
he
comes
every
monday
morning
around
we
used
to
spend
the
summers
in
amalfi
and
mama
had
trouble
with
her
lungs
max
and
l
used
to
play
with
a
boy
named
hans
vergerus
his
folks
came
from
d�sseldorf
the
father
was
some
kind
of
big
shot
a
supreme
court
justice
or
something
mama
didn�t
like
hans
l
guess
no
one
did
but
everyone
thought
he
was
some
kind
of
genius
once
we
caught
a
cat
and
tied
it
down
hans
cut
it
open
lt
was
still
alive
he
let
me
see
how
its
heart
beat
fast

fast
l
ran
across
him
again
ten
years
ago
in
heidelberg
when
we
were
there
with
the
circus
yes

l
remember
that
l
saw
him
again
today
hans
did
you
see
him
he
was
at
the
cabaret
manuela
lt�s
morning
the
advantage
of
knowing
influential
people
is
that
you
can
have
real
coffee
for
breakfast
the
fire
is
going
nicely
but
it
will
take
a
while
before
it
gets
really
hot
do
you
get
firewood
the
same
way
l
do
know
a
woodkeeper

as
a
matter
of
fact
but
l
don�t
know
anyone
who
can
get
me
butter
so
you�ll
have
to
eat
marmalade
lt�s
made
of
chemicals

the
label
says
l
owe
you
a
dollar

l
have
to
keep
track
well

you
you
should
keep
this
money
before
l
spend
it
all
on
booze
do
you
drink
so
much
whenever
l
have
the
money
you�re
not
going
back
to
the
circus

good
is
it
without

a
new
partner

nothing
of
the
kind
we�ll
make
a
new
number
together

l
abel

could
make
a
magical
act

could
take
over
his

kind
of
office

meat
while

rich
herr
rosenberg
yes
would
you
mind
coming
in
here
for
a
moment
my
name
is
frau
holle

l
am
manuela�s
landlady
manuela
just
had
time
to
tell
me
about
you
on
her
way
out
you
are
welcome
to
stay
here
with
me
for
a
short
time
these
sudden
changes
in
weather
make
my
back
ache
so
l
must
stay
in
bed
all
the
day
still

it�s
nice
with
a
peep
of
sun
in
november
isn�t
it

herr
rosenberg
would
you
care
for
a
glass
of
sherry
l
am
very
attached
to
manuela
lf
you
forgive
my
saying
so
l
am
as
fond
of
her
as
if
she
were
my
own
daughter
prosit

herr
rosenberg
she
is
so
kind
and
naive
l
think
your
sisterinlaw
is
heading
for
trouble

herr
rosenberg
the
odd
thing
about
manuela
is
that
she
doesn�t
defend
herself
nothing
must
happen
to
her
take
this
new
job
now
there�s
something
odd
about
it
the
society
for
church
democracy
what
is
that

herr
rosenberg
lt
isn�t
even
in
the
phone
book
l
must
go
now

frau
holle
how
much
is
the
rent
should
l
pay
in
advance
but
if
you
have
money

l
don�t
mind
you
have
dollars

haven�t
you
shall
we
say

a
month
or
is
that
too
much
no

of
course
not
have
you
been
crying
lt
just
seemed
so

forgive
me

herr
rosenberg
goodbye

frau
holle
goodbye

herr
rosenberg
we
have
been
waiting
for
you
may
l
ask
you
where
you�ve
been
all
night
l
couldn�t
very
well
sleep
in
that
room
where
have
you
been
with
my
sisterinlaw
she
lives
at

bergmannstrasse

doesn�t
she
yes

l
think
so

think
l
think
it�s
number


well

now
you
know
may
l
pack
some
things
not
yet

rosenberg
l
must
ask
you
to
come
with
us
to
the
morgue
to
identify
someone
l
have
to
l�m
afraid
l
must
insist
well

then

we�d
better
get
going
l�d
advise
you
to
smoke
down
there

lt
helps
do
you
recognize
that
girl
yes
who
is
she
greta
hofer
how
do
you
happen
to
know
her
she
was
engaged
to
my
brother
when
did
you
see
her
last
a
week
ago
was
your
brother
on
good
terms
yes

l
think
so
fr�ulein
hofer�s
been
assaulted
cause
of
deathdrowning
do
you
recognize
this
man
are
you
quite
sure
no
think
hard

rosenberg

lt�s
important
he�s
like
someone

who
he�s
like
my
father
you
can
do
better
than
that

that�s
all
he�s
like
my
father

my
father
died
five
years
ago
someone
stuck
a
very
thin
hypodermic
needle
into
this
man�s
heart
a
liquid
of
some
sort
was
injected
into
the
left
ventricle
a
poison
that
must
have
caused
him
hideous
pain
before
he
died
which
probably
took
several
hours
so
you
haven�t
seen
this
man
before
have
you
seen
this
woman
before
but
l�ve
seen
her

where
l
think
she
delivered
papers
l
used
to
meet
her
at
frau
hemse�s
boardinghouse
once

she
helped
me
up
the
stairs
when
l
was
too
drunk
to
make
it
on
my
own
her
name
is
maria
stern

l
didn�t
know
her
name
she
hanged
herself
in
the
basement
room
where
she
lived
with
her
husband
and
two
children
but
she
left
a
very
strange
letter
totally
muddled
she
said
she
had
been
frightened
to
death
and
that
the
pain
was
unbearable
l
don�t
think
l
can
take
this
have
you
ever
seen
this
boy
he
worked
at
the
cabaret

you
never
saw
him
there
he
used
to
stand
near
the
entrance
working
the
spotlight
you
must
have
seen
him
yes

it�s
possible
we
are
not
certain
how
he
was
killed
he
seems
to
have
been
run
over
by
a
truck
but
something
tells
us
he�d
been
assaulted
or
tortured
first
why
do
you
want
me
to
see
all
this
during
the
last
month

seven
mysterious
deaths
have
occurred
in
your
vicinity

herr
rosenberg
you
don�t
suspect
me
l
think
we
need
a
cup
of
coffee
this
can�t
be
called
coffee

but
it�s
something
not
very
chatty

are
you

rosenberg
can
you
account
for
the
movements
on
the
evening
of
sunday

october
th
you
can�t
l
was
drunk
ask
me
about
october
th

l
was
drunk
then

too
l�ve
been
drunk
every
night
since
l
left
the
circus
something
doesn�t
add
up
lf
you
were
so
well
known
good
income

good
reputation
why
did
you
start
drinking
l�m
an
alcoholic
famous
trapeze
artist
alcoholic
maybe
l
didn�t
feel
welcome
in
your
beautiful
city
why
do
l
have
to
stay
here
you
may
be
able
to
help
me
with
seven
unsolved
deaths
tomorrow
everything�s
gonna
disappear
why
bother
with
a
few
murders
l�ll
tell
you

rosenberg

l
bother
for
my
own
sake
l
know
that
the
catastrophe
could
be
here
in
a
few
hours
they
say
the
rate
of
exchange
for
the
dollar
is
five
billion
marks
the
french
have
occupied
the
ruhr
we
have
just
paid
a
billion
in
gold
to
the
british
on
every
damned
job
there
are
bolshevik
agitators
ln
munich

a
herr
hitler
is
preparing
a
putsch
with
thousands
of
starving
soldiers
and
madmen
in
uniform
we
have
a
government
that
doesn�t
know
which
way
to
turn
everyone�s
afraid

so
am
l
l
can�t
sleep
for
fear
nothing
works
properly
except
fear
on
friday
l
wanted
to
go
to
stettin
to
see
my
old
mother
she�ll
be


but
there
was
no
timetable
anymore
there
was
a
train
that
might
go

but
no
timetable

rosenberg
lmagine
a
germany
without
timetables
so
what
does
lnspector
bauer
do
lnspector
bauer
does
his
job
he
tries
to
create
a
little
patch
of
order
and
reason
in
the
midst
of
chaos
and
he�s
not
alone

rosenberg

all
over
germany
millions
and
millions
of
petty
officials
just
as
terrified

are
doing
exactly
the
same
you
get
drunk
every
day

huh
that�s
also
respectable

rosenberg
but
l�d
be
happier
if
you
swung
on
your
trapeze
with
your
pals
that
way
you�d
fight
your
fear
more
effectively
so
now
you
know
why
l
sit
here
investigating
something
l
think
is
extremely
odd
not
to
say
horrible
and
now
l
must
ask
you
to
keep
quiet
for
a
few
minutes
while
l
write
a
few
lines
to
lnspector
lohmann
who
is
working
on
another
case
that
also
seems
insane
sit
down

herr
rosenberg
what
do
you
suspect
me
of
aren�t
l
entitled
to
a
lawyer
this
is
a
chat

not
interrogation
you�re
taking
it
out
on
me
l
need
a
cigarette
l
know
why
you�re
doing
this
lt�s
because
l�m
a
jew
l
am
here
because
l
speak
english
you
are
allowed
to
smoke

you
have
ten
minutes
l
spoke
with
lnspector
bauer
he
was
very
kind
and
understanding
he
wants
to
help
you
he
said
you
went
crazy
what�s
wrong

manuela
l�m
just
worried
my
savings
are
stolen
l
suppose
you
don�t
know
where
they�re
gone
l
didn�t
know
you
had
any
savings
they�re
gone
anyway
luckily
l�m
in
charge
of
max�s
money
that�s
just
it

lnspector
bauer
told
me
they
found
max�s
money
on
you
when
they
searched
you
he
asked
me
if
l
knew
where
max
had
gotten
hold
of
this
money
l
said
it
was
our
savings
as
we
were
in
switzerland
with
the
circus
and
several
of
the
artists
changed
their
money
into
dollars
before
they
went
on
tour
to
germany
who
do
you
think
stole
your
money
you�re
not
listening
you�re
sick
what�s
wrong
she�s
sick
l
haven�t
eaten
today
l�d
like
to
point
out
that
you
have
only
a
few
minutes
left
manuela

ln
spite
of
the
way
you
attacked
me

my

lt�s
about

unreliable
and
arrogant
besides

the
authorities
don�t
approve
of
my
letting
unmarried
couples
share
a
room
herr
rosenberg

move

tuesday

november
th
the
newspapers
are
black
with
fear

threats

and
rumors
the
government
seems
powerless
a
bloody
confrontation
between
the
extremist
parties
despite
all
this

people
go
to
work
the
rain
never
stops
and
fear
rises
like
vapor
from
the
cobblestones
lt
can
be
sensed
like
a
pungent
smell
everyone
bears
it
like
a
nerve
poison
a
slowly
working
poison
felt
only
as
a
quicker
or
slower
pulse
or
as
a
spasm
of
nausea
abel

l�m
too
late

l
overslept
l�ll
be
home
at

for
dinner
l
don�t
know
why
l�m
bothering
you
my
name
is
manuela
my
father
was
a
magician

my
mother
was
a
circus
rider
l�ve
been
living
in
circuses
all
my
life
my
husband
was
a
circus
artist
as
well
maybe
it�s
wrong
of
me
to
trouble
you
but
l
need
to
talk
to
somebody
who
understands
this
last
week
l�ve
been
going
to
morning
masses
l�m
confused
and
then
someone
told
me
that
you
were
an
american
lt�s
very
comforting

my
german
isn�t
very
good
my
dear
woman

would
you
come
to
the
point
l
see
well

maybe
you�ll
come
again
all
this
guilt
is
too
much
for
me
l
feel
it�s
my
fault
that
max
committed
suicide
you�re
responsible
for
someone

and
then
you
fail
your
duties
and
you
stand
there
emptyhanded
and
ashamed
wondering
what
you
could
have
been
doing
now
l
feel
l
have
to
take
care
of
max�s
brother
abel
as
well
and
that�s
even
worse

worse
well

he�s
just
like
max

he
never
says
what
he�s
thinking
he
just
charges
ahead
with
all
his
feeling
and
he
looks
so
frightened
and
l
try
to
tell
him
that
we�ll
help
each
other
but
that�s
only
words
for
him
and
everything
l
say
is
useless
the
only
real
thing
is
fear
and
l�m
sick

l
don�t
know
what�s
wrong
ls
there
any
forgiveness
would
you
like
me
to
pray
for
you
do
you
think
that
would
help
l
don�t
know
now
yes

now
ls
it
a
special
prayer
yes

yes

let
me
think
wewe
live
so
far
away
from
god
that
he
probably
doesn�t
hear
us
when
we
pray
for
help
so
we
must
help
each
other
give
each
other
the
forgiveness
that
a
remote
god
denies
us
lsay
to
you
that
you
are
forgiven
for
your
husband�s
death
you�re
no
longer
to
blame
and
l
beg
your
forgiveness
for
my
apathy
and
my
indifference
do
you
forgive
me
yes

l
forgive
you
that�s
all
we
can
do
l
must
hurry
the
parish
priest
becomes
annoyed
if
l�m
late
young
woman

l
have
to
close
up

please
what
the
hell
does
this
mean
lt�s
a
place
where
we�re
going
to
live
lt�s
nice

isn�t
it
yesterday
when
you
came
to
the
cabaret
l�d
just
been
telling
hans
vergerus
about
all
our
trouble
he
suggested
at
once
that
we
could
move
into
this
flat
that
st

anna�s
clinic
has
the
use
of
lt
just
became
vacant
please
say
it�s
nice
we
don�t
have
to
pay
any
rent
for
the
time
being
he
also
said
that
you
could
work
in
the
clinic�s
archives
we
could
stay
here
and
decide
what
we
wanted
to
do
l�ll
be
damned
if
l�ll
live
here
or
accept
charity
from
that
goddamned
hans
vergerus
maybe
it�s
better
if
we
work
things
out
alone
l
probably
won�t
see
you
for
a
while
lt�s
best
not
to
mix
things
up
there
is
no
point
in
continuing
here
in
berlin
look
around
you

mr

rosenberg
sixteen
people

and
what
a
program

offer
you
anything
to
drink

cognac
a
cognac
for
mr

rosenberg
what
do
you
think

mr

rosenberg
a
cabaret
and
a
brothel
ln
beirut

example
a
totally
different
climate

a
totally
different
ambience
we�ll
close
earlier
tonight
and
shorten
the
program
lt�s
useless
staying
open
l�ve
never
seen
anything
like
this
rain
maybe
it�s
the
flood
cheers

mr

rosenberg
how
do
you
like
my
english
accent

lived
for
some
years
with
a
woman
fakir
from
new
jersey
she
taught
me
all
the
english
l
know
l�ve
been
expecting
this
can�t
you
sleep
l
have
to
be
drunk
to
go
to
sleep
l�ve
half
a
bottle
of
gin
in
the
small
suitcase
out
in
the
kitchen
you
know

actually
it�s
quite
nice
to
have
a
fever
you
can
daydream
you
fall
asleep
and
then
you
wake
up
everything�s
mixed
up
suddenly
you�re

years
old

and
then
l�m
lt�s
all
so
clear
that
damn
engine

lt�s
started
up
again
what
engine
don�t
you
hear
it
l
can
hear
something
rumbling
yes
lt�s
an
engine
that
bathrobe
you�re
wearing
belonged
to
papa
lt�s
quite
touching
l
can
remember
sitting
in
the
sunshine
watching
papa
practicing
a
new
number
lt
didn�t
work
very
good
mama
came
out
of
the
wagon
and
said
��you�re
not
doing
it
right��
and
she
showed
him
how
to
do
it
he
just
stood
and
looked
embarrassed
with
a
sheepish
smile
on
his
face
now
what�s
the
worst
thing
people
have
no
future
people
have
lost
the
future
l�m
getting
drunkfinally

introduce
myself

anna
clinic�s
archives
the
largest
hospital
archives
in
europe
and
one
of
the
largest
in
the
world
we
have
floor
space
of
several
thousand
square
meters
and
our
card
index
includes
over

entries
but
then

the
st

anna
clinic
has
been
in
existence
for

years
in
various
guises

of
course
may

show
you
to
your
place

herr

very
welcome

herr

seven
years
in
england
before
the
war
my
doctor�s
thesis
dealt
with
erotic
perversions
in
the
writings
of
ben
johnson

an
interesting
but
limited
subject
we
go
here

please
may
l
ask

herr
rosenberg
if
you
have
had
any
previous
experience
in
archive
work
no

unfortunately
l�ve
l
was
afraid
so

but

responsible
task

very
little
archive
experience

dr

silbermann
or
l
will
come
for
you

thing

mustn�t
be
taken
out
of
here

and
you
mustn�t
read
or
try
to
decipher
the
documents
that
pass
through
your
hands
all
the
files

full
of
reports
of
inconceivable
human
suffering
of
the
battles
of
science

its
victories
and
defeats
this
will
be
your
place

supposed
to
do

these
gray
files
here

files

them
to
the
yellow
files
after
which
you
will
number
and

november
th
there
is
no
milk
to
be
had
in
berlin
many
food
shops
remain
closed

they
have
nothing
to
sell
the
reichsmark

practically
ceased
to
exist
the
wads
of
bills
are
now
counted
by
weight
and
no
more
notice
is
taken
of
the
printed
value
when
you
began
your
employment
l
pointed
out
that
working
hours
are
from

to
could
you
be
so
kind
as
to
show
me
to
my
workplace
l
can�t
find
my
way
are
there
other
people
here
in
the
archives
every
day
we
are
visited
by
scientists
from
other
institutions
give
me
the
keys
give
me
the
keys
you
behave
most
improperly
to
an
old
man
lt�s
all
so
absurd
and
humiliating
surely
you
realize
l
won�t
tell
you
anything
no
matter
how
rough
you
are
unlike
you

l
have
a
conviction
something
unheard
of

happening
down
there
in
munich
a
savior

born
the
delivery
is
taking
place
in
pain
and
blood
a
terrible
time
is
at
hand
but
what
are

or

years
of
suffering
and
death
what
do
you
or
l
matter
what

even
millions
of

there
are

herr
rosenberg
kill
me

herr
rosenberg

l
won�t
resist
my
body
is
weak

but
my
soul
is
strong
and
calm
l
think
it�s
better
l
lock
the
door
so
that
no
one
will
disturb
us
dr

soltermann
warned
me
against
you
but
l
didn�t
believe
him
you
say
nothing
look
at
the
screen
and
you�ll
see
some
interesting
pictures
they
were
taken
during
our
experiments
here
at
the
st

anna
clinic
this
is
a
resistance
experiment
this
woman


years
old
volunteered
to
look
after
a
fourmonthold
baby
with
a
brain
injury
who
screams
day
and
night
we
wanted
to
see
what
would
happen
to
this
completely
normal

fairly
intelligent
woman
if
we
shut
her
in
with
a
child
that
never
stopped
screaming
as
you
see

after

hours
she
is
still
quite
selfpossessed
now

however


hours
have
passed
we
can
see
now
that
she
is
affected
her
sympathy
for
the
sick
child
has
been
wiped
out
her
feelings
replaced
by
a
deep
depression
which
in
its
turn
paralyzes
every
initiative
she
has
left
the
child
to
its
fate
here
we
can
see
quite
clearly
the
thought
of
ridding
herself
of
the
child
has
developed
but
it
took
another
six
hours
before
she
carried
out
her
intention
a
remarkable
resistance
unfortunately
our
camera
didn�t
manage
to
document
the
actual
deed
our
technique
has
not
been
quite
perfected
you
would
like
to
see
more

wouldn�t
you
for
seven
days

this
man
was
shut
up
in
a
cell
so
constructed
that
he
could
not
move
his
arms

legs

or
head
ln
addition

he
was
deprived
of
all
sound
and
was
in
total
darkness
l
know
what
you
are
going
to
say

abel
you
are
wondering
how
we
could
get
anyone
to
agree
to
such
an
experiment
voluntarily
no
trouble

l
assure
you
people
will
do
anything
for
a
little
money
and
a
square
meal
these
pictures
are
not
particularly
instructive
but
may
be
of
physiognomic
interest
the
subject
was
give
an
injection
of
thanatoxin
a
drug
that
produces
violent
anguish
what
you
will
see
is
someone
subjected
to
unbearable
agony
here
you
see
him
just
as
he�s
given
the
injection
you
notice
that
he
is
quite
balanced
and
is
laughing
and
joking
an
unusually
nice
boy

incidentally
he
was
a
student
of
political
science
at
the
university
we
are
now
at
the
condition
of
dread
which
is
getting
worse
and
worse
ln
a
few
moments
he�ll
commit
suicide
watch
carefully

lt
happens
without
any
warning
he
picks
up
the
revolver

you
can�t
see
it
properly
now
you
can
see
it
then
he
puts
it
in
his
mouth
the
gun
is
not
loaded

of
course
that
student
really
did
shoot
himself
a
few
days
later
although
the
effects
of
the
thanatoxin
had
completely
worn
off
your
brother
max
met
with
the
same
misfortune
by
the
way

he
was
one
of
our
best
assistants
he
was
really
interested
in
our
experiments
he
wanted
to
try
out
the
thanatoxin
l
advised
him
not
to

but
he
insisted
his
fianc�e
also
helped
us
quite
a
bit
they
were
very
attached
to
each
other
and
lived
for
a
time
in
one
of
the
apartments
that
you

yourself
this
is
one
of
our
most
recent
and
interesting
experiments
the
subjects
are
administered
carefully
controlled
doses
of
kapta
blue
a
virtually
odorless
gas
lnitially
the
gas
plays
tricks
with
the
behavioral
centers
throwing
the
entire
emotional
balance
out
of
kilter
the
subjects
are
stripped
of
their
social
defenses
lose
their
inhibitions

teeter
madly
between
quickly
changing
moods
which
possess
them
their
reactions
are
so
farcical
at
times
one
can
hardly
keep
from
laughing
of
course

repeated
exposure
to
kapta
blue
can
cause
some
permanent
damage
perhaps
you
are
wondering
what
my
intentions
were
with
you
and
manuela
placing
you
in
one
of
our
experiment
rooms
will
you
believe
me
if
l
tell
you
l
had
no
intentions
at
all
except
to
help
you
as
you
saw

the
building
behind
your
rooms
had
been
vacated
some
time
ago
we
were
forced
to
transfer
our
activities
to
a
more
outoftheway
place
we
must
take
great
care
besides

our
economic
resources
are
limited
we
are
financed
entirely
by
private
means
l�m
not
a
monster

abel
what
you
have
seen
are
the
first
faltering
steps
of
a
necessary
and
logical
development
l
know
you
have
told
lnspector
bauer
of
your
experiences
l
also
know
that
justice

represented
by
the
plodding
inspector
has
begun
to
move

slow
and
creaking
he�ll
be
here
soon
with
his
police
and
his
rusty
guns
but
in
a
few
moments
l�ll
bite
on
this
cyanide
capsule
l
did
consider
burning
the
archives
and
destroying
the
results
of
our
work
but
it
seemed
too
melodramatic
the
law
will
confiscate
our
results
and
then
file
them
ln
a
few
years

science
will
ask
for
the
documents
and
will
continue
our
experiments
on
a
gigantic
scale
we
are
ahead
of
our
time

abel
we
are
to
be
sacrificed
lt�s
only
logical
ln
a
day
or
two

maybe
even
tomorrow
the
national
units
in
south
germany
will
attempt
a
revolt
led
by
an
incredible
scatterbrain
called
adolf
hitler
lt
will
be
a
colossal
fiasco
herr
hitler
lacks
intellectual
capacity
and
method
he
doesn�t
realize
what
tremendous
forces
he
is
about
to
conjure
up
he
will
be
swept
away
like
a
withered
leave
the
day
the
storm
breaks
look
at
that
picture
look
at
all
those
people
they
are
incapable
of
a
revolution
they
are
far
too
humiliated
too
afraid

too
downtrodden
but
in
ten
years
by
then
the
yearolds
will
be
the
yearolds
will
be
to
the
hatred
inherited
from
their
parents
they
will
add
their
own
idealism
and
impatience
someone
will
step
forward
and
put
their
unspoken
feelings
into
words
someone
will
promise
a
future
someone
will
make
demands
someone
will
talk
of
greatness
and
sacrifice
the
young
and
inexperienced
will
give
their
courage
and
their
faith
to
the
tired
and
the
uncertain
and
then
there
will
be
a
revolution
and
our
world
will
go
down
in
blood
and
fire
ln
ten
years

no
more
those
people
will
create
a
new
society
unequalled
in
world
history
the
old
society
was
based
on
extremely
romantic
ideas
of
man�s
goodness
lt
was
all
very
complicated
since
the
ideas
didn�t
match
the
reality
the
new
society
will
be
based
on
a
realistic
assessment
of
man�s
potentials
and
limitations
man
is
a
malformation

a
perversity
of
nature
that
is
where
our
experiments
come
in
we
deal
with
the
basic
construction
and
reshape
it
we
set
the
productive
forces
free
and
control
the
destructive
ones
we
exterminate
what
is
inferior
and
increase
what
is
useful
l
always
liked
you
and
manuela
she
showed
an
affection
for
me
which
l
hope
was
sincerely
meant
against
my
better
judgment

l
tried
to
help
you
comic

isn�t
it

abel
one
day
you
can
tell
all
this
to
anyone
who
is
willing
to
listen
no
one
will
believe
you
despite
the
fact
that
anyone
who
makes
the
slightest
effort
can
see
what
is
waiting
in
the
future
lt�s
like
a
serpent�s
egg
through
the
thin
membranes
you
can
clearly
discern
the
already
perfect
reptile
you
were
given
veronal

you�ve
slept
for
two
days
what
day
is
it
lt�s
the
morning
of
november

can
l
have
some
water

l�ve
been
in
touch

can
use
you

his
circus
the
german
state
will
pay
for
a
train
ticket
to
basel
that�s
where
the
circus
will
be
for
the
next
two
weeks
l
take
it
for
granted
that
you
will
accept
his
kind
offer

no
lt
would
be
the
simplest
way

herr
rosenberg
a
constable
will
go
to
the
station
with
you
the
night
train
is
supposed
to
leave
at
by
the
way
herr
hitler
failed
with
his
munich
putsch
the
whole
thing
was
a
colossal
fiasco
herr
hitler
and
his
gang
underrated
the
strength
of
the
german
democracy
on
the
evening
of
sunday

november

th
abel
rosenberg

the
police

ive
been
lashed
with
large
electric
wire
cables
my

studied
at
the
french
school
in
teheran
id
go
to
the
french
school
in
vienna

my
father

to
get
me
a
visa
my
mothers
best
friend

supposed
to
take
me
in
the
day
before

put
jasmine
flowers
in
her
bra
when
she
was
taking
it
off

the
flowers
were
falling
from

tits
it
was
magic
how
do
you

icy
water
bowl

assholes
remember
that
its
stupidity
that
pushes
them
to
be
evil
it
will
prevent
you
from
answering
to
their
nastiness
because
theres
nothing
worse
than
bitterness
and
vengeance
always
remain
worthy
and
true
to
yourself
youll

everything
will
be
all
right

small
to
accomodate
me
she
found
me
a
bed
and
board
where
i

to
her
i

is
it
a
common
behavior
the
way
youre
eating
we
can
eat
in
front
of
tv
maybe

but
not
in
a
saucepan
so
its
true

iranians
have
no
education
is
it
true
that
you
were
all
prostitutes
it
was
the
beginning
of
a
series
of
moves
i
was
flying
from
apartment
to
apartment
eve
and
her
mother
took
me
in
after
that
i
was
living
with

homosexuals
next

i
was
living
in
a
maid
room
then
at
some
friends
home
to
finally
end
in
frau
doktor
schloss
villa
she
was
a
retired
philosophy
teacher
to
sum
up

she
was
nuts
the
rent
is

schillings

month

adopted
you
dogs
have
a
sixth
sense
they
recognize
good
people
i
decided
to
become
integrated
during
the
next
year
but
sometimes

western
culture
remained
a
mistery
i
had
to
improve
my
knowledge
from
sartre
to
bakounin

from
zweig
to
freud
i
read
everything
i
could
but
i
understood
that
some
things
would
be
beyond
me
forever
did
you
see
this
fat
pig
waldheim
has
been
elected
i
want
to
puke
it
cant
last
any
longer

we
must
demonstrate
all
of
this
is
hot
air
when
man
realizes
it
he
creates
games
for
ruler
and
bullshit
life
isnt
absurd
people
give
their
life
for
freedom
my
uncle
didnt
die
for
fun
my
feeling
of
disarray
was
immense
i
was
safe
here
while
my
kins
were
enduring
the
war
i
couldnt
let
go
this
feeling
of
guilt
i
wanted
to
live
like
a
girl
of
my
age
the
time
of
change
was
coming
within
a
few
months

i
became
a
young
woman
it
was
a
time
of
endlessly
repeating
ugliness
first

i
grew

cm

then
my
face
changed
my
face
got
longer

my
right
eye
got
bigger

followed
by
my
chin
my
right
hand
became
huge

then
it
was
my
left
foot
my
nose
got
three
time
bigger

my
breast
grew
my
buttocks
appeared

restoring
my
centre
of
gravity

huge
mole
appeared
on
my
nose

the
snow
chains
on

car
we
took
the
breakfast
together

as
before
nothing
had
changed

and

i
knew
that
nothing

we
talked
about
many
things
my
parents
kept
their
word
and
didnt
ask
me
any
question
i
didnt
feel
very
comfortable
but
i
thought
that
the
nightmare
was
behind
us
the
future
might
get
brighter
once
the
war
will
be
over
the
war
is
over

the
west

sides
we
had
been
stupid
enough
to
enter
this
cynical
game
years
of
war
for
nothing
a
million
dead
for
nothing
the
last
days
had
been
horrifying
a
month
before
the
armistice

irak
bombed
teheran
on
a
daily
basis
as
if
it
had
to
be
wiped
out
from
the
map
the
government
got
scared
because
some
opponents
had
fled
to
iran
so
the
state
decided
to
put
an
end
to
it
the
hard
way
they
proposed
to
the
convicts
to
renounce
their
ideals

to
promise
to
be
loyal
to
the
regime
or
to
be
executed
most
of
them
were
executed
now
streets
are
named
after
martyrs
thats
all
thats
left
to
famillies

street
names
when
you
walk
in
teheran
its
like
being
in
a
cemetery
youve
really
grown
youll
soon
be
able
to
catch
the
balls

the
lord

madeup
i

then
i
remembered
this
guy
who
was
eyeballing
me
you

them
i
couldnt
pretend
to
be
a
little
defenseless
girl
a
man
said
indecent
things
to

where
is
he
so
we
can
shut
him
up
arent
you
ashamed
dont
you
have
a
mother
a
sister
would
you
like
it
if
we
insulted
them

swear
it
on
my
mother
they

him
up
do
you
think

yes

dont
you
i
think
that
youre
a
fucking
slut
thats
what
i
think
i
had
no
other
choice
yes

you
had
everybody
has
a
choice
everybody
always
has
a
choice
your
grandfather
went
to
prison
for
protecting
innocents
did
you
forget
why
he
died
what
did
i
teach
you
intergrity
does
this
word
ring
a
bell

miss
shame
on
you
the
lady
with
the
bag
stop
running
the
lady
with
the
bag
stop
running
hey
stop
running
madam

why
are
you
running
you
must
not
run
like
that
when
youre
running

your
behind
makes
indecent
moves
fuck
it
wherever
we
stand

we
always
see
the
same
thing
anatomy
lesson
my
ass
the
only
thing
sticking
out
is
her
big
nose
go
to
the
central
university
immediately
all
the
absentees
will
be
suspended
for

weeks
we
must
behave
correctly
the
flowers
of
the
revolution
grew
from
the
blood
of
our
martyrs
to
have
an
indecent
behavior
is
like
trampling
on
the
blood
of
the
martyrs
so

im
asking
to
all
young
ladies
to
wear
tighter
trousers
and
longer
cowls
they
must
cover
their
hair
and
must
not
use
any
makeup
does
anybody
have
a
question
if
not

the
session
is
ended

yes
our
cowls
are
short

our
trousers
are
indecent
we
put
on
a
lot
of
makeup

etc
i
spend
a
lot
of
time
at
the
workshop
a
longer
cowl
makes
it
difficult
our
trousers
efficiently
hide
our
shapes
knowing
that
those
trousers
are
in
fashion
is
the
religion
defending
our
integrity
or
is
it
simply
opposed
to
fashion
you
make
comments
about
us
while
the
brothers
have
many
different
clothes
and
hair
cuts
sometimes

we
can
even
see
their
underwears
why
is
it
that
as
a
woman
im
not
allowed
to
feel
anything
when
watching
them
while
men
can
get
excited
on
our
shorter
cowls
its
great

its
as
if
you
had
cut
their
little
dick
take
off
this
fucking
cowl

it
makes
me
claustrophobic
i
tend
to
forget
it
dont
ever
forget
it
its
fear
that
makes
us
lose
our
selfawareness
its
also
changing
us
into
cowards
you
had
guts
im
proud
of
you
i
want
to
leave

to
go
where
to
the
usa
or
to
europe
where
in
europe
i
cant
stand
living
here
any
longer
youll
come
with
me
i
dont
want
to
leave

thats
because
youre
still
nostalgic
sooner
or
later

people
will
disgust
you
you
can
die
in
the
west

nobody
cares
well
manage
whats
your
relationship
with
him
well
call
your
parents
either
they
pay
or
it
will
be
some
lashing
when
your
mother
and
i
were


we
used
to
walk
together
holding
hands
and
yet
it
was
in
this
country

how
the
situation
is
now
you
have
to
be
careful
i
think
its
better
if
youre
not
seen
outside

this
situation
is
unbearable

cant
go
anywhere

not

you
do
are
you
gonna
get
a
divorce
as
soon
as
she
got
a
divorce
all
men
wanted
to
have
sex
with
her
then
the
baker
and
the
greengrocer
men
are
convinced
that
their
thing
is
irresistible
and
that
a
divorced
woman
will
accept
since
shes
not
a
virgin
anymore
stay
with
your
husband
as
long
as
you
can
somethings
wrong
dont
get
yourself
into
such
a
state
what
is
this
sorrow
for
whats

terrible
i
think

this
is
your
terrible
thing

for
a
simple
divorce
listen
to
me
carefully
i
did
it

years
ago
back
then

no
one
was
getting
a
divorce
i
knew
that
i
would
be
happier
alone
than
with
a
damned
nuisance
a
first
wedding
is
a
rough
work
for
the
second
one
youre
crying
because
you
were
wrong
its
hard
to
accept
your
own
mistakes

im
leaving
you
the
time
had
come
for
me
to
leave
i
decided
to
go
to
france
i
had
to
wait

months
for
a
visa
i
went
to
the
caspian
sea
with
grandma
where
i
filled
my
lungs
with
this
unique
air
an
air
like
nowhere
else
then
i
promised
grandpa
that
hed
be
proud
of
me
where
my
uncle
anouche
was
resting
somewhere
next
to
thousands
of
innocents
i
promised
him
to
try
to
be
true
to
myself
as
much
as
possible
then

one
day

the
time
to
leave
had
come
my
father

a
free
woman
iran

mom

grandma
my
sweet
little
girl

grandma

little
later

price

and
i
put
them
in
my
bra
this
way

i
always
smell
good
london
england
its
in
the
kitchen
where
you
left
it

how
did
you
get
out
you
have
a
nice
family
they
are
fine

alive

asleep
are
you
gonna
kill
me
if
i
was
gonna
kill
you

i
would
have
done
it
when
you
walked
to
your
car
this
morning
and
be
gone
by
the
time
your
body
hit
the
sidewalk
then
why
are
you
here
to
talk
but
mike

if
you
make
me
kill
you
you
will
not
go
alone
are
you
a
good
man

inspector

i
think
and
yet
youve
killed
men

yes
im
gonna
ask
you
a
question
how
you
answer
it

will
determin
how
this
night
ends
how
does
a
good
man
decide
when
to
kill
the
man
you
have
been
chasing
is
a
killer
rumor
has
it
that
he
is
working
for
a
group
known
only
as
the
orginisation
so
secret
no
one
knows
it
exists

takes
no
signs
yet
it
has
ties
to
every
government
its
sole
purpose
is
the
training
and
conditioning
of
professional
killers
these
men
are
selected
at
birth
rejects

orfans

all
of
them

unwanted
and
disposible
they
are
made
experts
in
every
aspect
of
combat
and
programmed
for
one
purpose
to
kill
the
man
you
have
been
chasing
the
last
years

inspector

is
the
very
best
of
them
put
him
there
you
should
not
have
stolen
from
me

brother

now
you
must
pay
what
happened
to
his
voice
a
man
what
did
you
do
to
his
voice
nothing

ovey
you
didnt
find
him
no
a
contractor

an
american
headquarter
nigerian
embassy
nigeria
we
have
all
heard
your
theories

this
is
not
a
theory

this
is
our
guy
no
motif

no
ferencic
evidence

no
witnesses
hes
a
hes
a
ghost
and
how
long
have
you
been
chasing
this
ghost
three
years
well

thank
goodness
you
have
interpol
to
finance
your
persistance

huh
you
see

inspector

it
is
unlike
any
in
the
third
world
we
attempt
competent
police
work
here
and
it
is
our
belief
that
juan
abir
was
killed
by
his
own
brother
so
he
choked
dow
a
pound
of
c
and
knocked
on
his
door
probably

general
this
man
truly
is
the
best
at
what
he
does
he
is
likely
responsible
for
over
one
hundred
deaths
let
me
show
you
what
i
mean
this
is
ove
and
these
are
just
the
ones
we
know
about

are
you
beginning
to
get
the
picture
they
might
kill
you
for
that
for
what
you
are
doing

that
whisky

are
brutalising

with
ice

not
be
a
success
until

the
only
ones
who
can
ruin
all

every
appearence
belikov
has
made
in
the
last

months
this
is
from
his
speech
he
made
in
london
on
may
the
seventh
and
this
is
from
some
shitty
billin
school
lunch
he
had
in
georgia

look
at
the
date
may
seventh

hows
that
possible
i
cant
be
sure

but
unless
he
has
figured
out
how
to
be
in
two
places
at
once
he
has
a
dubble

he
is
certainly
paranoid
enough
that
explains
the
arterial
spray

i
hope
he
had
health
benfits
when
i
was
a
little
girl

i
had
this
little
squarrel

black
stripes
on
the
back

for
the
introducing
of
udre
belikov

lovely

right
up
to
the
time
when
you
dragged
me
out
by
my
hair
undress
me
so
good
with
firearms

not
so
good
with
ladies
and
their
undergarments
careful

im
not
wearing
any
panties

nika

youre
drunk
and
this
is
a
very
bad
idea

oh
you
mean
this
yes

that
and
this
definetely
that
this
must
be
mr

price
so
you
took
it
upon
yourself
to
change
our
appointment
how
forward
of
you

as
i
told
your
men
downstairs
i
was
attacked
earlier
tonight
by
some
lunatic

my
common
sense
dictated
your
common
sense
should
have
dictated
you
not
abuse
my
good
nature
i
was
just
going
over
a
few
of
my
lines
with
some
of
your
competetors
lines

lines

do
you
get
it
hes
not
price
this
is
the
decador

mm
compaq

itsless
than

kg

selects
five
singles

fully
automatic
empty
and
safe
or
if
you
are
looking
for
an
assaultrifle

i
have
the
m

with
underbatter
grenade
launcher
a
lot
of
third
world
dictators
got
a
lot
of

stuff
it
safes
them
from

buy
ammo
everything
here

available
in
bulk

of
course

prices

not
negotiable
any
questions

mr
price
yeah
what
about
the
little
one
there
yeah

i
show
you

this
is
a
makarov
a
favorite
of
the
kgb
particually
effective
in
the
right
hands
but
for
a
real
target
you
need
to
find
a
soft
spot
hold
up
this
is
not
a
decador

its
a
chinese
copy

in
fact

i
dont
know
if
its
the
drugs
but
youve
been
wrong
about
most
of
these
weapons

if
the
gun
youre
holding
is
as
cheap
as
this
one
even
if
you
could
manage
to
shoot
her
in
the
eye

and
im
not
saying
you
could
you
wouldnt
kill
her
why
are
you
doing
this
to
me
i
need
you
to
help
me
with
your
brother
mikhail
fine

fuck
him

i
do
what
ever
you
want
what
the
fuck
do
you
want
me
to
do
just
this
you
know

it
says
here
when
the
male
penquin
meets
the
female
penquin
he
knows
in
the
first
ten
seconds
if
he
likes
her
or
not
are
you
listening
im
listening
i
read
that
this
article
is
full
of
shit
why
do
you
buy
these
magazines
for
the
advertisements
what
do
you
need
luggage
like
this
for
because
that
perfectly
holds
my
sniper
and
a
gag
for
irritating
talkative
little
girls
like
yourself

do
you
want
me
to
stop
and
get
it
out
i
dont
know

do
you
think
we
have
time
for
foreplay
you
know

when
i
was
a
little
girl

my
father
raised
grapes
and
i
told
him
that
i
would
own
my
own
wineyard
one
day
it
looks
nice
we
need
to
get
off
the
road
is
that
his
suitcase
how
did
we
get
that
as
a
consolation
price
captain
gudnayev
send
me
our
boys
stuff
from
the
hotel
in
st

p
in
case
it
might
help

anything
there
is
this

what
do
you
make
of
this
trust
onto
god
and
he
shall
direct
your
path
charms

i
never
thought
our
boy
as
the
religious
type
thats
strange
so
much
for
happy
endings
i
dont
want
you
to
do
this

belikov
needs
to
die
i
dont
care
about
that

not
anymore
as
long
as
hes
alive

they
will
never
stop
looking
for
you
take
this

at
the
next
station

get
off
the
train
as
soon
as
it
stops
move
with
the
crowd
but
i
dont
even
know
your
name
the
place
i
was
raised
they
didnt
give
us
names

they
gave
us
numbers
mine
was
that
explains
a
lot
how
will
i
find
you
dont
worry

ill
find
you
what
are
you
going
to
do
what
i
do
you
have
no
idea
of
the
pain
involved
in
the
procedure
they
peel
back
the
skin
of
the
face
and
screw
a
teflon
frame
to
the
bones
to
duplicate
the
facial
features
i
wonder

if
i
had
known
the
pain
involved
would
i
still
have
gone
through
with
this
whole
double
business
your
drunk
you
dont
want
to
drink
with
your
new
president
all
the
evidence
has
been
erased

mikhail

belikov
this
pathetic
brother

udre
now
i
am
the
one
and
only

the
one
man
i
have
asked
you
to
kill
the
only
one
who
can
expose
us

is
the
only
man
not
in
this
room
tell
me

comrad

what
excactly
have
you
done
to
find
him
it
seems
if
we
wait
long
enough

he
will
find
you
us

he
will
find
us

the
orginisation
has
sent
in
their
best
operatives
i
know

do
not
your
incompetence
hinder
them
if
you
want
to
have
this
conversation
again
three
hours
ago
belikovs
brother

found
dead
in
istanbul
ze
wachten
in
moskou
op

our
guy

hes
setting
belikov
up
but
were
getting
pressure
from
the
ministiry
and
the
eu
to
drop
this
investigation
but
the
russians
will
confirm
the
russians
are
the
ones
leading
eu
on
this
they
blatenly
deny
your
ghost
even
excists

and
a
foul
paper
is
with
the
ministers
office
claiming
youve
overstepped
your
athourity
who
brought
those
allegations
the
fsb

specifically
special
agent
jurij
markov
i
need
you
to
stop

no

you
dont
understand
the
fsb
is
covering
this
up

he
killed
belikovs
brother

why
why
would
he
do
that

unless
belikov
announced
that
attend
funeral
services
tomorrow
morning
for
the
burial
the
funeral
hes
gonna
take
belikov
at
udres
funeral
this
generator
produces
over

amps

much
more
than
what
is
nessesary
i
wanted
you
to
understand
the
gravity
of
this
situation
at


that
radio
taped
to
your
arm

order
the
shooting

your
friend

dont

the
generator
will
start
your
skin
will
melt

your
blood

through
a
great
deal
of
trouble
i
am
just
a
burekrat

there
is
nothing
i
can
do
for
you

im
afraid
i
disagree

this
is
not
a
request

this
situation
is
fixed
and
you

both
possible
outcomes

live
or
die
your
choice
heres
something
to
keep
things
in
perspective
i
picked
it
up
last
night
when
i
was
in
your
house
you
bastard

if
i
were
you
id
keep
that
radio
dry
yell
all
you
like

the
lord
himself
wont
hear
you
there
are
over

specially
trained
alpha
soldiers
in
this
cathedral
it
will
be
foolish
to
attempt
any
kind
of
violence
a
man
as
highly
trained
as
your
assassin
would
realize
this
what
if
he
doesnt
look
around
you
how
much
civilian
blood
do
you
think
will
be
shed
we
are
prepared
for
that
as
well
gascans
are
being
deployed

if
anything
should
occur

the
civilians
will
be
rendered
unconsious
now
if
you
will
excuse
me
one
minute

fifty
seconds
answer

answer
my
brother
he
was
a
troubled
man

but
he
was
not
always
like
that
one
minute

seconds
one
minute

seconds
shouldnt
we
choose
to
live
and
die
much
like
my
brother
should
we
do
what
is
nessesary
what
is
hardto
save
what
we
love
one
minute
i
for
one
will
not
fail
again

not
with
this
country

with
our
childrens
future

your
men
follow
me

lets
go
your
man
has
made
a
mistake

there
is
no
exit

hes
trapped
it
doesnt
make
sense

why
would
he
trust
on
to
god
and
he
shall
direct
you
path
shit

he
set
us
up
from
the
very
beginning
where
does
this
key
fit
the
last
bishops
personal
chambers
the
clock
tower

over
there
hes
going
into
the
river
like

st

p

jenkins

he
is
in
the
southwest
tower

him
escape
seems
i
underestimated
you

consistently
a
miscalculation
on
my
part
let
me
help
you

how
would
you
do
that
by
having
me
killed

no
for
that
i
am
sorry

it
was
a
mistake
and
nika

was
that
a
mistake
or
did
you
destroy
her
life
for
your
amusement
do
you
think
you
can
take
what
has
cost
millions

years
of
planning
for
the
good
of
this
country
and
destroy
that
then
what
walk
away
you
dont
really
think
they
will
let
you
do
that
if
you
kill
me
they
will
never
let
you
go

they
will
hunt
you
for
the
rest
of
your
life
you
did
your
job

and
you
did
it
very
well
and
for
that
my
boy

you
should
be
proud

thats
it
yes

im
offering
you
your
life
back

that
is
why
you

an
arrestwarrent
for
that
man
dont
move

hands
on
your
head
on
your
knees

dont
do
anything
stupid
just
one
thing
knowing
how
it
ends

was
it
worth
it
killing
belikov

knowing
how
this
ends
definetely
what
do
you
make
of
that
i
need
all
of
you
men
to
the
rear
of
that
vecicle

you
dont
have
juristiction
here
we
arent
here

that
means
that
when
we
open
up
with
then
this
will
never
have
happened
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
you
are
involved
in
terrorist
activities
were
interpol

and
in
accordance
with
section


were
transporting
an
international
criminal
you
know
what

im
sorry
man
my
mistake

i
thought

were
somenone
else
you
prick

on
behalf
of
the
us

government
i
would
like
to
extent
your
sincerest
apology
load
up

boys

even
so
now
what
now
you
have
to
answer
my
question
are
you
a
good
man

inspector
i
think
and
yet
youve
killed
men
so

inspector

how
does
a
good
man
decide
when
to
kill
if
i
think
a
man
means
to
do
me
or
my
family
harm
i
will
do
whatever
i
can
to
stop
them
but
beyond
that
its
a
crapshoot
the
key
you
knew
i
had
juristiction
and
would
walk
you
right
out
the
front
door

i
wanna
be
left
alone
just
like
that

yeah

like
that
this
is
the
man
youve
been
looking

that
he
was
shot
by
your
weapon
the
magazine

few
hours
until
the
girls

why
you
waited
so

weve
generated
a
threedimensional
image
of
the
structure
lts
massive

containing
hundreds
of
rooms

all
built
around
a
central
core
my
experts
tell
me
its
a
pyramid
what
they
cant
agree
on
is
who
built
it
and
when
one
expert
tells
me
this
has
features
reminiscent
of
the
aztecs
another
tells
me
its
probably
cambodian
what
they
all
agree
on
is
that
the
smooth
side
is
definitively
egyptian
l
think
your
experts
are
right

which
one
all
of
them

meaning
what

exactly
this
pyramid
contains
the
features
of
all
three
cultures
this
might
be
the
first
pyramid
ever
built
but
built
by
whom
by
the
first
civilization
but
how
could
anyone
possibly
build
a
pyramid
out
here
ancient
maps
show
antarctica
free
of
ice
lts
likely
the
continent
was
once
habitable

l
cant
tell
you
who
built
it
but
if
l
could
take
a
sample
from
it

l
can
tell
you
how
old
it
is
dr

to
put
you

you
here
bouvetoya

of
the

theres
no

to
the
pyramid
there
it
is

clear
as

and
the
same
time
yesterday
nothing

how
was
it
done
thermal
equipment
of
some
kind

like
yours
more
advanced

lncredibly
powerful
lve
never
seen
anything
like
it
theres
no
team
and
no
machine
in
the
world
that
could
cut
to
this
depth
in

hours
well

the
only
way
were
gonna
know
for
sure
is
to
get
down
there
and
find
out
look
at
that

change
it

now
ok

guys

whats
taking
so
long
theres

this
speech
before
my
dad
broke
his
leg
ft
from
the
summit
of
mount
rainier
he
was
like
you

he
wouldnt
go
back
or
let
us
stop
we
reached
the
top

and
he
opened
a
bottle
of
champagne
l
had
my
first
drink
with
my
dad
at
ft
on
the
way
down

he
developed
a
blood
clot
in
his
leg
that
traveled
to
his
lung
he
suffered
for
four
hours
before
dying

minutes
from
the
base
you
think
thats
the
last
thing
your
dad
remembers
the
pain
or
drinking
champagne

mark
after
all
thank
you

thank
you
thank
you
all
for
this
lets
make
history
thomas
l
recognize
the
egyptian
the
second
symbol
is
aztec
preconquest
era

the
third
is
cambodian
then
you
were
right

the
pyramid
contains
all
three
cultures
thats
what
it
looks
like

you
may
choose
to
enter
those
who
choose
may
enter
who
taught
you
to
translate
funny

kinda
looked
like
you
well

its
not
choose
lts
chosen
only
the
chosen
ones
may
enter
quinn

is
that
you
out
there
what
is
all
this
this
is
the
sacrificial
chamber
like
the
aztecs
and
the
egyptians
whoever
built
this
pyramid
believed
in
ritual
sacrifice
this
is
where
the
chosen
ones
were
offered
to
the
gods
those
that
were
chosen
would
lie
here
they
werent
bound
or
tied
in
any
way
they
went
to
die
willingly
men
and
women
lt
was
considered
an
honor
lucky
them
they
gave
their
lives
so
the
hunt
could
begin
lts
common
in
ritual
sacrifice
to
take
the
heart
of
the
victim
thats
nice
but
thats
not
where
your
heart
is
besides

it
looks
like
the
bones
were
bent
straight
out
something
broke
out
of
this
body
what
have
you
found

max
lts
a
shaft
to
another
level
looks
like
theres
another
room
down

lets
move
to
that
lower
room

were
moving
on

everyone
ms

woods
you

stay
here

rousseau

you
stay
with
him

keep
a
team
with
you
catalogue
everything

should
be
directly
below
the
sacrificial
chamber
sebastian
lts
a
sarcophagus
this
is
the
long
count
this
is
the
aztec
calendar
and
this

its
some
kind
of
combination
lock
days
months
years
the
dials
are
set
for
whats
todays
date
october
are
you
sure
this
is
gonna
work
l
dont
know
back
up

a
little
too
much
excitement
weve
been
out
long
enough
for
today
well
set
up
base
camp
at
the
whaling
station
and
get
back
at
it
tomorrow
morning
well

you
can
go
back
to
the
base
camp

ms

woods

but
were
staying
here
no

you
wanted
to
leave
without
proper
prep

we
did
you
wanted
to
be
the
first
here

we
are

youve
claimed

find

lts
yours
now

we

were
done
for
the
day
you
heard
her
what
do
you
wanna
do
with
these
take
them
well
run
further
tests
on
the
surface
no

no
dont
touch

come
in

rousseau

come
in
ls
there
anything
you

up
the
rest
of
the
team
and
get
to
the
surface

lets
move
what
are
you
doing
my
job

yours
is
over
my
job
is
over
when
everyone
is
back
on
the
boat
safely
and
that
gun
doesnt
change
anything
this
bearing
should
take
us
back
to
the
entrance

well
regroup
at
the
whaling
station
what
about
thomas
rousseau
well
find
them
on
the
way
up

max
stand
behind

cover
our
backs
the
heat
bloom
your
satellite
detected
makes
more
sense
now
a
building
this
sophisticated
requires
an
energy
source
l
think
thats
what
your
satellite
detected

a
power
plant
for
this
pyramid
firing
up
preparing

preparing
for
what
keep
close
recognize
whats
on
their
shoulders
yeah
we
worshipped
these
things
according
to
this

we
did
and
the
artifacts
you
removed
from
the
sarcophagus
seem
to
be
their
weapons
lets
keep
moving

only
another

yards
to
the
entrance
take
cover
wheres
stone
stone
the
pyramids
shifting
again
the
doors
are
closing

get
out
ok

lets

this
if
l
have
to
carry
you
the
whole
way
theres
no
way
out
back
there
whats
that
just
a
theory
the
aztec
calendar
was
metric

based
on
multiples
of
ten
lm
guessing
the
pyramid
reconfigures
every
ten
minutes
lets
stick
together
lt
would
seem
that
we
are
rats
in
a
maze
connors
connors
verheiden

weyland
come
with
us

get
her
outta
here
now
come
on
dont
turn
your
back
on
me
hes
marking
himself

what
ancient
warriors
would
mark
themselves
with
the
blood
of
their
kill
lts
a
rite
of
passage
this
is
starting
to
make
sense
the
hieroglyphs
are
a
little
difficult
to
make
out
but
the
story
is
all
here
thousands
of
years
ago

these
hunters
found
a
backwater
planet
they
taught
humans
how
to
build
and
were
worshipped
as
gods
every
hundred
years
the
gods
would
return
and
when
they
did

they
would
expect
a
sacrifice
humans
were
used
to
breed
the
ultimate
prey
the
hunters
would
battle
with
these
great
serpents
to
prove
themselves
worthy
to
carry
the
mark
but
if
the
hunters
lost
they
made
sure
nothing
survived
an
entire
civilization
wiped
out
overnight
so
the
humanoids

the
hunters
they
brought
those
creatures
here
to
hunt
and
they
use
us
like
cattle
were
hosts
for
them
to
breed
in
the
heat
bloom
was
the
sign
to
lure
us
down
here
this
whole
thing
was
a
trap
without
us

there
could
be
no
hunt
verheiden
when
that
door
opens

were
dead
not
if
we
set
things
right

what
do
you
mean
this
pyramid
is
like
a
prison
we
took
the
guards
guns

and
now
the
prisoners
are
running
free
to
restore
order

the
guards
need
their
guns
when
that
door
opens

were
gonna
give
that
thing
his
gun
back
are
you
crazy
during
a
biggame
hunt

the
animals
being
hunted
dont
arm
the
hunters
theyre
not
hunting
us

were
in
the
middle
of
a
war
lts
time
to
pick
a
side

we
are
on
our
side
we
have
to
consider
the
possibility
that
we
might
not
make
it
out
of
here
but
we
have
to
make
sure
those
serpents
dont
reach
the
surface
because
if
they
do
everything
everywhere
could
die
the
enemy
of
my
enemy
is
my
friend

to
come
to
brazil
my
mom
didnt
want

get
to
pretend
to
be
the
boyfriend
when
creepy
guys
try
to
bother
her
what
happens
when
creepy
girls
bother
you
so
what
about
you
you
traveling
alone
yeah
thats
brave

not
really

ive
been
everywhere
they
tell
you
not
to
go
colombia

nigeria

just
spent
three
months
in
a
favela
in
rocinha
the
only
place
ive
ever
had
any
problems
is
in
a
small
town
in
australia
so

youre
from
australia

a
boyfriend
in
australia
no
you
did
not
just
say
that
what
so

you
got
a
boyfriend
in
australia
i
just
meant
that
if
i
had
a
girlfriend
or
a
little
sister
who
was
traveling
alone
id
be
a
little
worried

thats
all
well

dont
be

i
can
take
care
of
myself
so

did
she
say
this
was
a
proper
bar
with
real
drinks
i
dont

she
didnt
say
christ

id
do
anything
for
a

christ
on

much
about

we
believe
his
family
was
in
a
romanian
circus
troupe
who
died
in
a
terrible
fire
although
the
doctors
could
find
nothing
physically
wrong
he
never
spoke
a
word
and
there
were
other
idiosyncrasies

he
was
a
painfully
shy
child
until
it
came
time
for
his
monthly
haircut
then
one
morning

he
was
simply
gone
the
thin
man
was
protecting
max

saying
this
man
is
the
sole
benefactor
of
your
orphanage

is
an
angel

you
had

youre
such
a
typical
rebellious
pisces
always
out
to
prove
how
tough
and
independent
you
are
and
you
couldnt
make
it
one
day
on
your
own

could
you
someone
reminded
me
that
every
angel
is
unique
and
i
knew
it
was
you
who
else
had
contacts
in
mongolia
could
hack
the
halo
failsafe
and
hire
a
surfer
as
an
assassin
with
a
lion
on
his
helmet
as
leo
very
well
done
very
impressive

really
youve
got
it
all
figured
out
and
now
im
gonna
really
enjoy
knocking
those
halos
right
off
your
heads
but
youre
an
angel
i
dont
take
orders
from

twinge
of
nostalgia

little
bit
different

just

right
up
in
there
i
have
i
like
the
patch
let
me
see
your
patch
is
this
natalie
im
on
fire
over
your
right
shoulder
why
is
somebody
coming
up
behind
me
ladies
and
gentlemen

the
driving
force
behind
catholicism
wow

cardinal
glick
now
we
all
know
how
the
majority
and
the
media
in
this
country
view
the
catholic
church
they
think
of
us
as
a
pass�

archaic
institution
people
find
the
bible
obtuse
even
hokey
now

in
an
effort
to
disprove
all
that
the
church
has
appointed
this
year
as
a
time
of
renewal
both
of
faith
and
of
style
for
example

the
crucifix
while
it
has
been
a
timehonored
symbol
of
our
faith
holy
mother
church
has
decided
to
retire
this
highly
recognizable
yet
wholy
depressing
image
of
our
lord

crucified
christ
didnt
come
to
earth
to
give
us
the
willies
he
came
to
help
us
out
he
was
a
booster

and
its
with
that
take
on
our
lord
in
mind
that
weve
come
up
with
a
new

more
inspiring
sigil
so

it
is
with
great
pleasure
that
i
present
you
with
the
first
of
many
revamps
the
catholicism
wow
campaign
will
unveil
over
the
next
year

i
give
you
the
buddy
christ
thats
not
the
sanctioned
term
were
using
for
the
symbol
just
something
weve
been
kicking
around
the
office
but
look
at
it
doesnt
it
pop
well

there
you
have
it
let
me
get
this
straight
you
dont
believe
in
god
because
of
alice
in
wonderland
no

through
the
looking
glass
that
poem

the
walrus
and
the
carpenter
thats
an
indictment
of
organized
religion
the
walrus

with
his
girth
and
his
good
nature
he
obviously
represents
either
buddha
or
with
his
tusks

the
hindu
elephant
god

lord
ganesha
that
takes
care
of
your
eastern
religions
now

the
carpenter

which
is
an
obvious
reference
to
jesus
christ
who
was
raised
a
carpenters
son

he
represents
the
western
religions
now

in
the
poem

what
do
they
do
they
dupe
all
these
oysters
into
following
them
and
then
proceed
to
shuck
and
devour
the
helpless
creatures
en
masse
i
dont
know
what
that
says
to
you

but
to
me
it
says
that
following
these
faiths
based
on
mythological
figures
ensures
the
destruction
ofones
innerbeing
organized
religion
destroys
who
we
are
by
inhibiting
our
actions

by
inhibiting
our
decisions
out
of
fear
of
some
intangible
parent
figure
who
shakes
a
finger
at
us
from
thousands
of
years
ago
and
says

do
it
do
it
and
ill
fuckin�
spank
you
ohjesus
the
way
you
put
it

ive
never
really
thought
about
it
like
that
before
what
have
i
been
doing
with
my
life
what
am
i
yeah

i
know
listen

my
advice
to
you
you
take
this
money
that
youve
been
collecting
for
your
parish
go
get
yourself
a
nice
dress

fix
yourself
up
find
some
man
find
some
womanyou
can
connect
with

even
for
a
moment
cause
thats
really
all
life
is

sister
a
series
of
moments
why
dont
you
seize
yours
that
a
girl
you
know

heres
what
i
dont
get
about
you
you
know
for
a
fact
that
there
is
a
god
youve
been
in
his
presence

hes
spoken
to
you
personally
yet
i
heard
you
claim
to
be
atheist

i
like
to
fuck
with
the
clergy

man
i
just
love
it

i
love
to
keep
those
guys
on
their
toes
heres
what
i
dont
get
about
you
why
do
you
feel
the
need
to
come
to
this
place
all
the
time
my
friend

because
this
is
humanity
at
its
best
look
at
them
all
that
anger

all
that
mistrust

all
that
unhappiness
forgotten
for
that
one
perfect
moment
when
they
get
off
the
plane
see
those
two
what
that
guy
doesnt
know
is
that
the
girl
cheated
on
him
while
she
was
away
she
did
twice
nice

but
it
doesnt
matter
right
now
cause
theyre
just
both
so
relieved
to
be
with
one
another
i
wish
they
all
could
feel
that
way
more
often
is
this
why
i
had
to
come
down
here
and
miss
my
fucking
cartoons
you
call
me

you
tell
me
its
important
what

to
share
in
your
halfassed
obsession
with
hallmark
moments
were
going
home
somebody
sent
us
this
in
the
mail
take
it
and
quit
leering
at
me

people
will
think
i
just
broke
up
with
you
you
said
were
going
home

didnt
you
read
cardinal
glick
cuts
ribbon
on
catholicism
wow
campaign
you
have
to
keep
reading
the
rededication
of
st

michaels
church
is
the
kick
off
of
a
new
campaign
which
seeks
to
bring
catholicism
into
the
mainstream
with
a
papal
sanction

the
arch
way
entrance
of
the
centuryold
jersey
shore
house
of
worship
will
serve
as
a
passage
way
of
plenary
indulgence
a
littleknown
catholic
belief
offering
all
that
passes
throug
hits
arches
a
morally
cleans
late
for
sunday
news
brief

im
grant
hicks
all
i
gotta
do

i
walk
through
the
arch
thing

and
then
i
can
go
back
home
no

by
walking
through
the
archway

all
your
sins
are
forgiven
then
all
we
have
to
do
is
die

die
i
dont
wanna
die
you
rather
hang
around
here
no

we
dont
know
if
we
can
die
but
what
if
we
can
and
then
the
arch
thing
doesnt
work
what
then

hell
fuck
that
its
impossible

if
we
cut
off
our
wings
and
transubstantiate
to
complete
human
form

we
become
mortal
if
we
die
with
clean
souls

theres
no
way
they
can
keep
us
out
we
wont
be
angels
anymore

but
at
least
we
get
to
go
home
who
sent
the
paper
who
cares
who
sent
the
paper
all
that
matters
is
that
after
all
these
years

we
found
a
loop
hole
he
cant
keep
us
out
anymore
once
were
back
in

itll
be
forgive
and
forget
but
this
thing

this
is
church
law
its
not
divine
mandate
church
laws
are
fallible
because
theyre
created
by
man
one
of
the
last
sacred
promises
imparted
to
peter

the
first
pope
by
the
son
of
god
before
he
left
was
whatever
you
hold
true
on
earth
ill
hold
true
in
heaven
its
dogmatic
law

if
the
church
says
its
so

god
must
adhere
this
thing
has
a
papal
sanction
let
it
never
be
said
your
anal
retentive
attention
to
detail
never
yielded
positive
results
you
cant
be
anal
retentive
ifyou
dont
have
an
anus
outstanding
work
theresjust
one
thing
i
think
we
gotta
do
before
we
leave
this
is
gonna
help
us
get
back
on
his
good
side
here

ive
been
dreaming
about
this
for
five
years

read
that
mooby

the
golden
calf
creating
an
empire
out
of
simplicity
i
wanna
hit
em
you
really
are
just
a
simple
creature
we
finally
find
a
way
back
and
you
want
to
jeopardize
that
because
youve
got
a
soft
spot
for
the
good
old
days
what
betterway
to
repent
than
by
resuming
the
position
i
once
denied
i
dont
think
a
killing
spree
is
gonna
make
things
better
for
us
killing
spree
im
talking
about
divine
justice
here
im
talking
about
reigning
down
fire
and
brimstone

punishing
the
wicked
hes
all
about
that

i
know
hed
want
this
done
there
hasnt
been
an
angel
of
death
sinceyou
quit
doesnt
that
mean
anything
to
you
and
besides

what
if
youre
wrong

like
you
always
are
if
im
wrong
which
im
not
its
not
gonna
matter
were
gonna
pass
through
your
arch
thing
anyway
were
gonna
be
forgiven

no
harm

no
foul
well

he
does
hate
competition

i
will
say
that
and
your
mooby
certainly
falls
under
that
heading
where
is
this
church
we
have
to
go
to
new
jersey

rededication
ceremony
is
in
four
days
last
four
days
on
earth
if
i
had
a
dick

id
go
get
laid
we
can
do
the
next
best
thing

whats
that
lets
kill
people
oh

not

the
greater
illinois
chapter
of
the
right
to
life
foundation

prochoice
league
next

at
todays
second
collection
will
be
donated
to
the
john
doe
jersey
life
fund
for
those
of
you
who
havent
been
following
the
news
an
unidentified
homeless
man
who
was
accosted
and
severely
beaten
at
the
newjersey
shore
last
tuesday
ies
in
critical

but
stable
condition
in
one
of
that
areas
hospitals
he
lacks
identification
and
police
have
had
no
luck
tracking
down
any
possible
family
the
archbishop
of
the
trenton
diocese
has
disputed
the
states
decision
to
remove
the
indigent
man
from
lifesupport
systems
asking
that
catholics
all
over
the
country
join
in
this
protest
against
euthanasia
well

now
please
rise
for
the
recession
of
faith
we
believe
in
one
god

the
father
almighty
maker
of
heaven
and
earth
we
believe
in
jesus
christ

his
only
son

our
lord
choose
life
youre
gonna
burn
in
hell

ya
fuckin�
baby
killer
holy
shit

its
the
pope
huh
where
what
are
you
talking
about
jesus
youre
a
catholic

cant
you
talk
to
them
they
hate
me
more
than
you

no
doubt
at
least
you
have
an
excuse

youre
jewish

you
dont
know
any
better
we
already
used
that
excuse
when
we
killed
christ
where
were
you
yesterday
we
went
to
brunch
i
went
to
church
that
still
kills
me

you
and
church
if
only
they
knew
your
weekly
tithing
came
from
a
planned
parenthood
check
i
dont
know
why
i
still
go

liz
i
can
remember
going
to
church
when
i
was
young
and
being
moved
now
i
sit
there
every
sunday
and
i
feel
nothing
i
dont
think
i
have
any
faith
left
remember
that
seminary
student
i
tried
to
set
you
up
with
the
yearold

the
one
i
could
have
babysat
for
in
high
school
the
point
is

he
told
me
something
he
said
that
faith
is
like
a
glass
of
water
when
youreyoung

the
glass
is
little

so
its
easy
to
fill
as
you
get
older

the
glass
gets
bigger
the
same
amount
of
liquid
doesnt
fill
it
anymore
but
periodically
the
glass
has
to
be
refilled
youre
suggesting
i
need
to
get
filled
in
more
ways
than
one
you
need
to
get
laid

bethany
sloane

you
need
a
man

if
only
for

minutes
its
been
my
experience
that
the
average
male
is
never
a
man
not
even
for
ten
minutes
in
his
entire
life
span
that
sounds
militant

are
you
thinking
of
joining
the
other
side
couldnt
do
it

women
are
insane
then
you
need
to
go
back
to
church
and
ask
god
for
a
third
option
i
think
god
is
dead
the
sign
of
a
true
catholic
good
afternoon

mrs

reynolds
were
checking
on
possible
freon
leaks

me

every
room
except

do
know
what
that
means

dont
you
no
pleasure

no
rapture

no
exquisite
sin
greater
than
central
air
pick
that
up
this
will
be
the
base
of
operations
from
here
on
in
now

ifl

the
protocol
correctly

last
scion

angels

anatomicallyimpaired
as

ken
doll
make
yourself
useful
and
give
me
that
towel
you
bottomfeeders
and
your
arrogance
you
think
everybodysjust
trying

your
knickers
im
pissed
off
is
what
i
am
do
you
drench
everyone
who
comes
in
your
room
with
flameretardant
chemicals
no
wonder
youre
single
stand
back
as
i
was
sayin�
prior
to
your
firefighting
episode
i
am
the
metatron
dont
tell
me
the
name
doesnt
ring
a
bell
you
people
if
there
isnt
a
movie
about
it

its
not
worth
knowing

is
it
i
am
a
seraphim
the
highest
choir
ofangels
you
do
know
what
an
angel
is

dontyou
metatron
acts
as
the
voice
of
god
any
documented
occasion
when
some
yahoo
claims
that
god
has
spoken
to
them
theyre
speaking
to
me
or
theyre
talking
to
themselves
why
doesnt
god
speak
for
himself
glad
you
decided
to
join
the
conversation

to
answer
that
human
beings
have
neither
the
aural

nor
the
psychological
capacity
to
with
stand
the
awesome
power
ofgods
true
voice
wereyou
to
hear
it

your
mind
would
cave
in
and
your
heart
would
explode
we
went
through
five
adams
before
we
figured
that
one
out
well

how
do
i
know
youre
an
angel
aside
from
the
fiery
entrance
and
the
expansive
wing
span
you
want
more
proof
how
about
tequila
where
the
hell
are
we
only
place
you
can
go
for
good
tequila
dos
tequilas

por
favor

and
an
empty
glass
were
in
mexico
actually

were
in
a
franchised
mexican
family
eatery
down
the
street
from
your
apartment

but
its
impressive
none
the
less
you
dont
mind
i
lost
the
wings

do
you
im
trying
to
keep
our
profile
low
what
do
you
want
with
me
i
am
to
charge
you
with
a
holy
crusade
for
the
record

i
work
in
an
abortion
clinic
noah
was
a
drunk

lookwhat
he
accomplished
and
no
ones
asking
you
to
build
an
ark

all
you
gotta
do
is
go
to
new
jersey
and
visit
a
small
church
on
a
very
important
day
new
jersey
that
doesnt
sound
like
much
of
a
crusade
aside
from
the
fine
print

thats
it
whats
the
fine
print
stop
a
couple
of
angels
from
entering
and
thus
negating
all
existence
wait

wait

wait

repeat
that
stop
a
couple
of
angels
from
entering
and
thus
negating
all
existence
i
hate
it
when
people
need
it
spelled
out
for
them
you
might
want
to
clarify
that
back
in
the
old
days

god
was
vengeful
and
hottempered
and
his
wrath
was
bore
by
the
angel
of
death

name
of
loki
when
sodom
and
gomorrah
was
destroyed
that
was
loki
when
the
waters
wiped
out
everything
except
noah
and
his
menagerie
that
was
loki
and
he
was
good
at
what
he
did
but
one
day
he
refused
to
bear
gods
wrath
any
longer
why
he
listened
to
his
friend
a
grigori
by
the
name
of
bartleby
grigori
one
of
the
choirs
of
angels

theyre
called
watchers
guess
what
they
do
so
one
day

lokis
wiping
out
all
the
first
born
of
egypt
the
tenth
plague
tell
a
person
that
youre
the
metatron
and
they
stare
at
you
blankly
mention
something
out
of
a
charlton
heston
movie
and
suddenly
everybodys
a
theology
scholar
may
i
continue
uninterrupted
once
hes
done
with
the
first
born
loki
takes
his
friend
bartleby
out
for
a
postslaughter
drink
and
over
many
rounds
they
get
into
this
discussion
about
whether
or
not
murder
in
the
name
of
god
is
okay
and
in
the
end
bartleby
convinces
loki
to
quit
his
position
and
take
one
which
doesnt
involve
slaughter
very
inebriated
loki
tells
god
he
quits
throws
down
his
fiery
sword
and
gives
him
the
finger
which
ruins
it
for
the
rest
of
us
because
from
that
day
forward
god
decreed
that
angels
could
no
longer
imbibe
alcohol
hence
all
the
spitting
so

for
their
insolence
god
decreed
that
neither
loki
nor
bartleby
would
ever
be
allowed
back
into
paradise
were
they
sent
to
hell
worse
wisconsin
for
the
entire
span
of
human
history
and
when
the
world
ends

theyll
have
to
sit
outside
the
gates
for
all
eternity
and
this
has
what
to
do
with
me
someone
has
clued
them
in
to
a
loop
hole
in
catholic
dogma
that
would
allow
them
to
reenter
heaven
so
what
they
beat
the
system

good
for
them
its
not
that
simple
if
they
get
in

they
will
have
reversed
gods
decree
now
listen
closely
because
this
bits
very
important
existence
in
all
its
form
and
splendor
function
solely
on
one
principle
god
is
infallible
to
prove
him
wrong
would
undo
reality
and
everything
that
is
up
would
become
down

blackwould
become
white
existence
would
become
nothingness
if
theyre
allowed
to
enter
that
church
theyll
unmake
the
world
if
this
is
so
major

why
are
you
talking
to
me
why
doesnt
god
do
something
about
it
he
could
but
hed
rather
see
you
take
care
of
this
one
personally
because
of
who
you
are
and
who
am
i
the
girl
in
the
pjs
dont
ask
so
many
questions

just
serve
your
purpose
im
gonna
have
to
pass
i
beg
your
pardon
when
some
quiet
little
infection
destroyed
my
uterus

where
was
god
when
my
husband
decided
he
couldnt
be
with
a
wife
who
couldnt
bear
his
children
where
was
god
dont
allow
eons
of
history
and
life
to
get
blinked
out
of
being
just
because
youve
got
a
grudge
against
your
creator
so
you
lost
the
ability
to
make
life
youre
being
offered
the
chance
to
play
mother
to
the
world
by
acting
like
one
and
protecting
it
saving
it
but
i
cant
make
you
however

ifyou
should
decide
to
stop
being
selfish
and
accept
your
responsibility
you
wont
be
alone
youll
have
support
what
more
angels
prophets
in
a
manner
of
speaking

two
ofem
the
one
who
speaks
and
he
will

at
great
length

whether
you
want
him
to
or
not
will
make
mention
of
himself
as
a
prophet
well

hes
the
quiet
type
look

ive
gotta
go
remember

were
working
in
a
time
frame
here
whats
he
like
but
funny
hes
got
a
great
sense
of
humor
take
sex

for
example

theres
nothing
funnier
than
the
ridiculous
faces
you
people
make
midcoitus
sex
is
a
joke
in
heaven
the
way
i
understand
it

its
mostly
a
joke

the
motherfucking

i
would
think
the
impact

which
you

you
death

a
worry
of
the
living
the

the
flavor

this
discussion
over
a
twopiece
and
a
biscuit

im
starvin�

back

wait
a
second
between
guys
with
wings

guys
falling
out
of
the
sky
and
guys
trying
like
hell
to
fuck

i
think
ive
been
a
pretty
good
sport
about

so
far
but
im
not
going
anywhere
until
i
find
out
where
the
hell
you
came
from
me
i
came
from
heaven
now
lets
start
walkin�
walk
fuck
you
do
you
know
how
far
we
are
from
anywheres
hey

man

back
in
the
old
days
withjc


we
used
to
walk
everywhere
did
you
ever
hear
of
a
fat
apostle
what
the
hells
an
apostle
let
me
get
this
straight
shes
already
met
the
prophets
and
the
apostles
with
them
i
think
that
our
best
course
of
action
is
to
ensure
that
our
parcel
is
not
found
and
being
that
i
cant
even
trust
you
enough
to
kill
a
woman
well

im
left
with
no
choice
but
to
seek
outside
assistance
in
guarding
said
package
im
gonna
have
to
summon
the
golgothan
i
appreciate
the
loan

brother

you
can
have
that
back
man

i
remember
when
all
we
used
to
have
for
breakfast
was
fish
and
goats
milk
what
do
you
call
this
shit
egga
mooby
muffin
now

how
�bout
you
start
explaining
some
things

like
for
starters
how
did
you
know
where
to
find
us
do
you
know
what
the
dead
do
with
most
of
their
time
watch
the
living

especially
in
the
shower
i
cant
wait
to
die
and
why
are
you
watching
me
because
youre
the
one
whos
gonna
help
me
get
some
changes
made
in
that
book
you
put
so
much
stock
in
hustler
the
bible
whats
your
beefwith
the
bible
for
starters

im
not
in
it
neither
are
any
of
us

but
you
dont
hear
us
bitchin�
and
moanin�
but
im
supposed
to
be
in
it

i
was
the
th
apostle
ive
gone
to
church
my
whole
life
and
never
heard
of
rufus

the
th
apostle
but
you
heard
of
the
other

apostles
they
were
all
white
boys

i
might
add

but
no
mention
of
me

rufus
and
why
is
that
cause
im
a
black
man
butyou
know
what
thats
just
my
pet
peeve
im
mainly
here
to
correct
a
major
error
youve
been
basing
your
faith
on
whats
that
jesus
wasnt
whitejesus
was
black
i
dont
buy
it
if
thats
true

why
did
he
get
written
about
and
you
were
left
out
well

he
is
the
son
ofgod
kind
of
hard
to
have
a
new
testament
without
him
so
you
fudge
a
few
facts

you
put
a
spin
on
his
ethnicity
leaving
me
out
is
okay
cause
you
still
got


white
boys
to
choose
from
are
you
gonna
listen
to
this
shit
thats
what
people
of
antioch
said
right
before
they
stoned
my
ass
you
were
martyred
thats
one
way
of
puttin�
it
anotherway
is
to
say
i
was
bludgeoned
to
shit
by
big
fucking
rocks
white
folks
only
wanna
hear
the
good
shit
life
eternal

a
place
in
gods
heaven
but
as
soon
as
you
hear
that
youre
gettin�
this
good
shit
from
a
black
jesus

ya
freak
and
that

my
friends

is
called
hypocrisy
a
black
man
can
steal
your
stereo

but
he
cant
beyour
savior
you
gonna
eat
that
hash
brown
so

you
went
to
heaven
damn
right
i
went
to
heaven
thats
the
least
he
could
do
in
the
three
years
i
followed
his
ass
around
jerusalem

did
i
ever
get
laid
hell
no

and
i
was
in
my
prime
i
could
have
been
kneedeep
in
shepherds�
daughters
not
to
mention
fineass
mary
magdalene
she
had
a
thing
for
dark
meat

if
you
follow
me
maybe
this
is
just
me
talking

but
ifl
were
in
heaven
i
wouldnt
care
what
the
bible
said
as
long
as
they
got
the
message
right
the
message
is
what
counts
but
folks
who
build
their
faith
on
that
message
should
be
color
blind
and
all
my
rabblerousing
is
not
doing
that
much
above
so
im
gonna
need
some
help
down
here
thats
why
im
gonna
help
you
stop
those
angels
from
gettin�
into
that
church
in
exchange
for
you
helping
me
with
my
campaign
how
do
you
know
about
that

the
angels

dont
know
about
you

on
your
hand

that
shit

of
a
penchant
for
the
dramatic
oh

idolaters
i
cant
believe
you
forgot
the
magazine
thats
you
do
you
know
much
about
voodoo
thats
a
fascinating
practice

no
real
doctrine
of
faith
to
speak
of
more
an
arrangement
of
superstitions
the
most
wellknown
ofwhich
is
the
voodoo
doll
a

of
an
individual

false

loki

loki

lucky
i

down
here

how
long
now
three
years
this
august
let
me
guess
the
th
apostle

left
out
of
the
bible
because
shes
a
woman
this
girls
no
woman
oh

those
werent
tits
i
saw
jay
cozying
up
to
what

these
you
should
know
better
than
anyone
here
that
tits
dont
make
a
woman
hell

the
tubby

coatwearing
motherfuckers
got
tits
what
traditionally
defines
a
woman
falls
between
two
things
her
legs
but
as
you
can
see
i
lack
definition
hey

theyre
gettin�
a
free
show
let
me
see
that
shit
oh

god

another
angel
like
metatron
how
do
you
how
does
she
know
metatron
this
is
the
last
scion
im
confused
bethany

serendipity
here
isnt
technically
an
angel
nor
is
she

by
any
means

a
human
being
like
i
was
and
you
are
i
used
to
be
an
abstract

now
im
really
confused
im
a
muse

stupid
i
cant
take
much
more
of
this
so
you

what

inspire
people
whatjust
went
down
with
your
friends
over
there
it
doesnt
really
take
a
muse
to
inspire
horny
retards
to
empty
their
wallets
i
used
to
specialize
in
entertainment
for
example

im
responsible
for


of
the

topgrossing
films
of
all
time
nineteen
yeah
the
one
about
the
kid
by
himselfin
his
house
burglars
trying
to
come
in
and
he
fights
them
off
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
that
one
somebody
sold
their
soul
to
satan
to
get
the
grosses
up
on
that
piece
of
shit
what
are
you
doing
stripping
remember
why
i
left
because
you
were
tired
of
getting
none
of
the
credit
for
your
ideas
so
i
opted
to
quit
being
a
muse
and
write
for
myself
i
gave
my
two
weeks
notice

got
a
body


bucks
and
got
sent
out
into
the
world
to
make
my
fortune
so
what
happened
writers
block
can
you
believe
it
me

a
muse

for
gods
sake
i
can
inspire
anyone
i
meet
and
give
out
a
zillion
and
nine
ideas
a
second
but
i
cant
keep
any
for
myself
her
quirky
sense
ofhumor
whose
gods
youre
saying
gods
a
woman
was
there
ever
a
doubt
in
your
mind
hes
always
referred
to
as
him
thats
not
how
i
wrote
it
but
one
of
the
drawbacks
to
being
intangible
is
that
you
have
no
say
in
the
editorial
process
the
people
that
held
the
pens
added
their
own
perspective
and
all
the
penholders
were
men
so
she
became
a
he

doesnt
stop
with
god
either
the
whole
books
genderbiased
a
womans
responsible
for
original
sin
a
woman
cuts
samson
coif
of
power
a
woman
asks
for
the
head
of
john
the
baptist
read
that
book
again
women
are
painted
as
bigger
antagonists
than
the
egyptians
and
romans
combined
it
stinks
why
is
the
last
scion
here
bartleby
and
loki

they
found
a
way
back
not
the
plenary
indulgence
loop
hole

you
know
about
that
i
always
knew
that
thing
was
a
bad
idea
leave
it
to
the
catholics
to
destroy
existence
you
have
issues
with
catholicism

i
take
it
i
have
issues
with
anyone
who
treats
god
like
a
burden
instead
of
a
blessing
like
some
catholics
you
people
dont
celebrate
your
faith

you
mourn
it
lf
were
wrong

what
religion
is
right
its
not
about
whos
right
orwrong
no
denominations
nailed
it
yet
because
theyre
all
too
selfrighteous
to
realize
that
it
doesnt
matter
what
you
have
faith
injust
that
you
have
faith
your
hearts
are
in
the
right
place

but
your
brains
gotta
wake
up
they

rapists
whenever

underestimate
the
staggering
drawing
power
of
the
garden
state
show
up
two
hours
in
advance
your
hardon
for
smiting
has
prevented
us
from
negotiating
what
ought
to
be
the
relatively
simple
matter
of
catching
or
staying
on
a
bus
bus

schmuss
why
should
we
fall
victim
to
gravity
when
we
can
just
as
easily
rise
above
you
mean
fly
we
got
wings

right
fuck

looking
for
you
both
sides

above
and
below

why
word
is
that
gods

look
bad
by
succeeding
where
hes
failed
so
many
times
so
theyrejust
gonna
kill

thats
why
you

down
your
behavior

off
their
respective
radars
quit
killing
people

thats
high
profile
oh

lighten
up

i
cant
believe

boys
theyve
even
got
the
last
scion
looking
for
you

youre
kidding
this
is
huge

your
reentry
is
a
thorn
in
a
lot
of
sides
theyll
stop
at
nothing
to
prevent
it
in
the
meantime

i
suggest
you
find
an
alternate
mode
of
transportation
if
anything
else
comes
up

ill
contact
you
thank
you

azrael

youre
a
true
friend
i
have
to
get
back
to
the
pit
before
they
get
suspicious
and
remember

incognito
how
you
coping

kid
its
weird
just
when
i
think
i
have
a
handle
on
things
something
wholly
unbelievable
presents
itself
sometimes
i
wish
id
just
stayed
home
you
sound
like
the
man
whats
he
like
he
likes
to
listen
to
people
talk
christ
loved
to
sit
around
the
fire

listen
to
me
and
the
other
guys
whenever
we
were
going
on
about
unimportant
shit
he
always
had
a
smile
on
his
face
his
only
real
beefwith
mankind
is
the
shit
that
gets
carried
out
in
his
name
wars

bigotry

televangelism
the
big
one

though

is
the
factioning
of
all
the
religions
he
said
mankind
got
it
all
wrong
by
taking
a
good
idea
and
building
a
belief
structure
on
it
youre
saying
having
beliefs
is
a
bad
thing
i
just
think
its
better
to
have
ideas
you
can
change
an
idea

changing
a
beliefis
trickier
people
die
for
it

people
kill
for
it
the
whole
of
existence
is
in
jeopardy
right
now
because
of
the
catholic
belief
structure
regarding
this
plenary
indulgence
shit
bartleby
and
loki

whether
they
know
it
or
not
are
exploiting
that
belief
and
if
theyre
successful
you

me

all
of
this
ends
in
a
heartbeat
all
over

belief

while

being
dumped
i
was
dumped
once
dont
you
just
constantly
question
your
value
like

why
was
i
so
easy
to
cast
aside
and
you
wonder
if
the
other
party
is
gonna
come
to
their
senses
they
always
tell
you
itll
hurt
less
with
time
they
always

we
need
a
lot
ofdrinks
garcon

still
go
to
church
every
sunday
does
it
do
anything
for
you
it
gives
me
time
to
balance
my
checkbook
everyweek
thats
what
im
saying

people
dont
go
to
church
to
feel
spiritual
anymore
they
go
to
church
and
feel
bored
but
they
keep
going
everyweek
just
out
of
habit
i
am
so
buzzed
when
do
you
think
you
lost
your
faith
i
remember
the
exact
moment
i
was
on
the
phone
with
my
mother
and
she
was
trying
to
counsel
me
through
this
this
thing
and
when
nothing
she
was
saying
was
making
me
feel
any
better
bethany
god
has
a
plan
i
was
i
was
so
angry
with
her
i
was
like
what
about
my
plans
you
know
mmhmm
i
had
planned
to
have
a
family
with
my
husband
wasnt
that
plan
good
enough
for
god
apparently
not
how
about
you
howd
you
lose
your
faith
one
day
godjust
stopped
listening
i
kept
talking

but
i
got
the
distinct
impression
he
wasnt
listening
anymore
how
did
you
know
she
was
listening
in
the
first
place
well

i
guess
i
dont
i
hate
thoughts
like
that
but

you
know

they
come
to
you
with
age
cause
when
youre
a
kid
you
never
question
the
whole
faith
thing
gods
in
heaven

and
hes
shes
always
got
her
eye
on
you
id
give
anything
to
feel
that
way
again

why
i
got
talked
into
this
pilgrimage

door
the
door
cant
we
talk
about
this
why
dont
i
just
get
off
at
the
next
stop
no
ticket
the
apostle
is
here

i
noticed
then
you
know
who
she
was

dont
you
the
scion

i
imagine
maybe
we
should
rethink
this
whole
thing
i
mean

you
heard
the
guy

he
said
there
are
consequences
and
azrael
tells
us
were
marked
theres
more
to
this
than
we
thought
of
i
was
close
you
know
i
was
so
close
to
slitting
that
bitchs
throat
you
know
how
i
felt
righteous
justified

eager

even
you
all
right
your
eyes
are
kinda
my
eyes
are
open
for
the
first
time
i
get
it
when
that
little
innocent
girl
let
her
mission
slip

i
had
an
epiphany
see

in
the
beginning
it
was
just
us
and
him
angels
and
god
then
he
created
humans
ours
was
designed
to
be
a
life
of
servitude
and
worship
and
bowing
and
scraping
and
adoration
he
gave
them
more
than
he
ever
gave
us

he
gave
them
a
choice
they
choose
to
acknowledge
god
or
choose
to
ignore
him
all
this
time
weve
been
down
here
ive
felt
the
absence
of
the
divine
presence
and
its
pained
me

as
im
sure
it
must
have
pained
you
and
why
because
of
the
way
he
made
us
had
we
been
given
free
will
we
could
choose
to
ignore
the
pain

like
they
do
but
no

were
servants
all
im
saying
here
is
that
one
ofus
might
need
a
little
nap
wake
up
these
humans
have
besmirched
everything
hes
bestowed
upon
them
theywere
given
paradise
they
threw
it
away
theywere
given
this
planet
they
destroyed
it
theywere
favored
best
among
all
his
endeavors
and
some
of
them
dont
even
believe
he
exists
and
in
spite
ofit
all
he
has
shown
them
infinite
fucking
patience
at
every
turn
i
asked
you
once
to
lay
down
the
sword
because
i
felt
sorry
for
them
what
was
the
result
our
expulsion
from
paradise
where
was
his
infinite
fucking
patience
then
its
not
right
its
not
fair
weve
paid
our
debt
dont
you
think
its
time
dont
you
think
its
time
we
went
home
and
to
do
that

i
think
we
may
have
to
dispatch
our
wouldbe
dispatchers
wait

wait

wait

kill
them
youre
talking
about
the
last
scion

for
christs
sake
and
what
about
jay
and
bob
those
guys
were
all
right
dont

dont

my
friend
dont
let
your
sympathies
get
the
best
of
you
they
did
me
once
scion
or
not
and
by
passing
through
that
arch
our
sins
are
forgiven
no
harm

no
foul
my
god

ive
heard
a
rant
like
this
before
ive
heard
a
rant
like
this
before

dont
you
do
that
to
me
you
sound
like
the
morning
star

you
shut
your
fucking
face
you
sound
like
lucifer

man
youve
fucking
lost
it
youre
not
talking
about
going
home

bartleby
youre
talking
about
fucking
war
on
god
well

fuck
that
i
have
seen
what
happens
to
the
proud
when
they
take
on
the
throne
im
going
back
to
wisconsin
were
going
home

loki
and
no
one

not
you

not
even
the
almighty
himself
is
gonna
make
that
otherwise
why
couldnt
we
stay
on
the
train
you
threw
those
guys
off
very
basic
strategy
if
your
enemies
know
where
you
are

then
dont
be
there
well

i
know
id
perceive
the
person
sent
to
kill
me
as
an
enemy
what
does
that
mean
since
when
am
i
supposed
to
kill
anybody
im
tired
of
all
this
cryptic
bullshit
im
physically
and
psychologically
exhausted

rufus
and
im
ready
to
kick
back
and
welcome
the
end
of
existence
unless
you
come
clean
right
now
out
of
all
the
people
on
the
goddamn
planet

why
was
i
tapped
imagine
youre
a
yearold
boy
youre
told
youre
gods
only
son

but
more
than
that

youre
god
how
long
do
you
think
it
would
take
to
come
to
grips
with
something
that
huge
maybe

say


years
in
the
biblejesus
suddenly
goes
from
age

to



to
now

thats
some
pretty
bad
story
telling
where
are
the
volumes
of
text
dealing
with
the
missing

years
they
were
offered
up
as
a
sacrifice
to
the
god
of
ecumenical
politics
you
make
it
sound
like
theres
some
church
conspiracy
to
cover
up
the
truth
about
christ
any
important
material
about
christ
any
important
material
about
christ
would
give
people
a
better
understanding
of
the
nature
ofgod
why
would
they
leave
any
of
it
out
because
its
tied
in
with
his
family
his
mother
and
father

his
brothers
and
sisters
jesus
didnt
have
brothers
and
sisters

mary
was
a
virgin
mary
gave
birth
to
christ
without
having
known
a
mans
touch

this
is
true
but
she
did
have
a
husband
do
you
really
think
he
wouldve
stayed
married
to
her
for
all
those
years
ifhe
wasnt
gettin�
laid
the
nature
of
god
and
the
virgin
birth

those
are
leaps
of
faith
but
to
believe
a
married
couple
never
got
down

thats
just
plain
gullibility
the
blood
that
flows
through
your
veins
the
blood
that
flows
through
your
veins
shares
a
chromosome
or
two
at
the
genetic
level
with
the
one
you
call
jesus
bethany

you
are
the
greatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreat
greatgreatgreatgreatgrandniece
of
jesus
christ
so

that
would
make
bethany
part
black
i
cant
do
this
anymore
whereyou
gonna
go
you
know
what
im
saying
is
right
its
bullshit

bethany
let
her
go

man
give
her
time
what
the
fuck
do
you
want
from
me
i
fucking
hate
you
he
cant
hear
you

you
know
thats
why
we
needed
you
why
didnt
you
tell
me
would
you
could
you
have
believed
me
only
after
everything
youve
seen
everything
youve
heard
could
you
possibly
be
able
to
accept
the
truth
i
dont
want
this
its
too
big
thats
what
jesus
said
i
had
to
tell
him
you
can
imagine
how
that
hurt
the
father
not
to
be
able
to
tell
the
son
himself
because
one
word
from
his
lips
would
destroy
the
boys
frail
human
form
so
i
had
to
deliver
the
news
to
a
scared
child
who
wanted
nothing
more
than
to
play
with
other
children
i
had
to
tell
this
little
boy
that
he
was
gods
only
son
and
it
meant
a
life
of
persecution
and
eventual
crucifixion
at
the
hands
of
the
very
people
hed
come
to
enlighten
and
redeem
he
begged
me
to
take
it
all
back
as
if
i
could
he
begged
me
to
make
it
all
not
true
ill
let
you
in
on
something

bethany

something
ive
never
told
anyone
before
if
i
had
the
power
i
would
have
its
unfair
to
ask
a
child
to
shoulder
that
responsibility
and
to
ask
you
to
do
the
same
now
i
sympathize

i
do
i
wish
i
could
take
it
all
back
but
i
cant
is
who
you
are
everything
i
am
has
been
a
lie
knowing
what
you
now
know
doesnt
mean
youre
not
who
you
were
bethany
sloane
no
one
can
take
that
away
from
you

not
even
god
all
this
means
is
a
redefinition
ofthat
identity
the
incorporation
of
this
new
data
into
who
you
are
be
who
youve
always
been
be
this
as
well
from
time
to
time
guess
this
means
no
more
cheating
on
my
taxes
to
say
the
least
do
you
mind
if
we
ad
journ
to
somewhere
a
tad
more
habitable
and
a
bit
warmer
fuck

i
think
this
shit
just
kicked
in
werent
wejust
in
the
woods
what
are
we
doing
here
now
going
out
in
style
the
voice

the
apostle
now

whos
this
motherfucker
the
voice
of
god

show
some
respect
oh

the
voice
of
god

wheres
the
rest
of
him
funny
you
should
mention
that

were
not
sure
what
didnt
it
ever
occur
to
you
that
this
bartlebyloki
situation
was
well
within
the
sphere
of
his
control
yes

but
then
whywas
she
tapped
you
know
those
constitutionals
that
he
likes
to
take
i
think
were
beyond
euphemisms
at
this
point
i
think
were
beyond
euphemisms
at
this
point
gods
a
skeeball
fanatic
the
lord
has
quite
a
fancy
for
the
game

hes
been
playing
it
foryears
he
assumes
a
human
form
once
a
month
and
indulges
doesnt
tell
anyone
where
hes
playing

hejust
goes
away
for
a
couple
of
hours
and
he
always
gives
his
free
points
away
to
neighbor
hood
children
but
she
hasnt
come
back
from
one
of
these
day
trips
but
she
hasnt
come
back
from
one
of
these
day
trips
no

she
hasnt
and
weve
been
unable
to
locate
her
he
couldve
been
killed

human
form
does
have
that
drawback
no

theres
a
different
sort
of
foul
play
a
foot

children
whomever
has
set
the
renegade
angels
on
their
path
and
is
keeping
them
quite
well
hidden
is
also
responsible
for
the
lords
whereabouts
were
he
to
be
killed
in
human
form
hed
have
returned
immediately
to
heaven
someone
knew
enough
to
keep
him
biologically
alive
but
incapacitate
him
in
another
fashion
and
as
omnipotent
as
we
are
above
i
have
to
admit
that
were
more
or
less
lost
without
his
presence
weve
looked
everywhere
for
him
i
tapped
her
because
i
thought
wed
be
able
to
smoke
out
whoevers
behind
this
but
whoever
he
is
has
been
clever
enough
to
send
some
lackeys
afteryou
as
opposed
to
showing
up
themselves
could
it
be
lucifer
if
he
was

hed
have
made
his
move
by
now
to
conquer
heaven
and
i
know
hes
not
responsible
for
bartleby
and
loki
because
hes
hadjust
as
much
to
lose
by
their
return
as
anybody
else
what
do
we
do
now
i
say
we
get
drunk

cause
im
all
out
of
ideas
why
dont
wejust
ask
this
guy
to
close
the
church
the
guy
in
charge
of
the
church
thing
cardinal
glick
maybe
we
can
ask
him
to
shut
down
the
church
if
its
closed
that
day

those
guys
cant
get
blessed
or
whatever

right
the
little
stoners

a
point

angry
ladies

judged
as
guilty
of
violations
against
our
almighty
god
and
this
very
day
i
assure
you
you
will
all
pay
for
your
trespasses

little
exposed

former

kicked

fucking
apple
polisher
yes

what
yes

what
well

lucifer
just
had
to
start
his
little
war
for
the
throne
heaven
became
divided
into
two
factions
the
faithful
and
the
renegades
oh

the
ethereal
plains
were
chaotic
with
battle
angel
against
angel
and
when
it
was
all
over

god
cast
the
rebels
into
perdition
but
azrael
refused
to
fight
he
remained
in
the
middle

waiting
to
see
who
came
out
victorious
what
are
you

some
kind
of
fuckin�
chicken
i
was
an
artist
i
was
inspiration
a
muse
has
no
place
in
battle
so
after
the
fallen
were
banished
to
hell
god
turned
on
those
that
wouldnt
fight
and
azrael
was
sent
down
with
the
demons
something
he
considers
a
great
injustice
dont
tell
meyou
never
questioned
the
judgment

serendipity
no

it
never
bothered
me
soyou
were
an
artist
elvis
was
an
artist
but
that
didnt
stop
him
from
joining
the
service
in
time
o
fwar
thats
why
he
is
the
king
and
youre
a
schmuck
so
all
this
is
about
revenge
youre
gonna
unmake
existence
because
you
have
a
grudge
against
god
after
the
first
million
years
no
escape
from
hell
became
my
allconsuming
reason
so
i
studied
the
religions
and
waited
for
my
opportunity
to
present
itself
which
it
finally
did
in
catholicism
but
i
couldnt
exercise
it
but
i
couldnt
exercise
it
demons
cant
become
human
no

we
cant
transubstantiate
but
angels
can
bartleby
and
loki
after
that
it
was
a
simple
matter
of
waiting
for
a
church
to
celebrate
their
centennial
and
when
that
finally
happened
i
sent
the
pair
an
article
laced
with
ideas
an
incantation
i
picked
up
in
the
pit
kept
them
cloaked
and
off
heavens
radars
and
aside
from
the
triplets
here
and
the
golgothan
no
soul
in
hell
had
a
clue
as
to
what
was
going
on
but
the
almighty
could
still
putsch
the
whole
deal
so
i
dispatched
him
in
a
fairly
ingenious
fashion
her

and
how
thats
the
only
thing
i
couldnt
figure
out
oh

no

ive
seen
way
too
many
bond
movies
to
know
that
you
never
reveal
all
the
details
ofyour
plan
no
matter
how
close
you
may
think
you
are
to
winning
the
only
x
factor
was
the
involvement
of
the
last
scion
here
but
fat
lot
ofgood
that
did

right
i
mean

here
you
all
are
powerless
to
stop
the
inevitable
look

asshole

i
dont
know
if
anyone
explained
the
rules
to
you
but
if
you
succeed
everything
gets
blinked
out
of
existence

even
you
human

haveyou
ever
been
to
hell
id
rather
not
exist
than
go
back
to
that
and
if
everyone
has
to
go
down
with
me

so
be
it
still
thinking
only
about
yourself
you
fucking
child
now

now

now
things
are
getting
too
intense
in
here
hey

watch
a
little
tv

huge
fucking
wings

laid
waste
tost

that
and
i
told
them
to
keep
a
low
profile

couple
minutes
its
not
going
to
matter

had
something
in
my
eye

to
save
these
poor
schmucks
but
we
still
exist
where

they
they
could
already
be
in
the
church

come
out

nobody
touches
them
the
brother
here

gonna
shred
em
with
his
angelbegood
special

a
mortal
sin

a
mortal
sin
on
your
soul
and
you

a
solution
to
fall
from
the
sky
no

was
a
cardinal

was
a
cardinal

gonna
have
to
do
the
funny
thing
is

this
guy
could
never
even
stand

you

you

ive
become
aware
of
the
repercussions

i
know
what
im
doing
you
sick

twisted
fuck
you

of
all
people

should
understand
what
im
trying
to
accomplish
here
you
too
know
what
it
feels
like
to
be
cast
aside
but
youve
only
dealt
with
the
pain
a
few
years
ive
dealt
with
it
for
a
millennia
while
you
never
see
your
exhusband
or
how
blissful
he
is
with
his
new
wife
and
he
is
seeing
you
people
every
day
on
this
perfect
world
he
created
for
you
is
a
constant
reminder
that
though
my
kind
came
fiirst
your
kind
was
most
revered
and
while
you
know
forgiveness
we
know
only
regret
the
lesson
must
be
taught
all
are
accountable
even
god
soon
a
cadre
of
police
will
arrive
just
in
time
to
kill
us
as

failed
experiment
called
existence
will

be
no

the
drawbacks

a
woman

not
really

something

all
right
crisis
of
faith

i
think
im
now
burdened
with
an
over
abundance
when
it
rains

it
pours
are
you
saying
you
believe
but
i
have
a
good
idea
the
man
was
right
about
you
now
im
gonna
go
home
and
tell
him
so
and
if
you
clean
up
your
language
i
just
might
put
in
a
good
word
for
you
too
why
dont
you
name
the
kid
after
me
rufus
yo

we
should
go
to

stop
youse
guys

half
a
stalk
when
she

the
bitch

to
me
that
way
anymore

im
gonna
be
somebodys
mother
you
know

when
youre
pregnant
you
can
have
sex
until
the
third
trimester
when
i
was
a
kid
i
used
to
carry
a
rabbits
foot
for
good
luck
but
in
somalia

i
traded
it
for
two
cold
budweisers
and
a
back
issue
of
penthouse
you
hear
people
talk
about
the
horrors
of
war
all
the
time
but
the
dirty
little
secret
is
if
youre
just
reporting
it
war
has
its
bright
side
as
well
i
know

i
know

im
sacrilegious
but
being
that
close
to
death
being
that
alive
its
completely
addictive
and
if
anyone
tells
you
otherwise

they
are
lying
i
worked
with
simon
hunt
for
nine
years
we
worked
as
a
team
for
the
network
news
covering
wars
from
el
salvador
to
desert
storm
to
the
killing
fields
of
bosnia
are
we
moving
or
what
yes

were
moving
no
one
was
crazier
than
he
was
no
one
was
as
dangerous
as
fun

or
as
good
as
he
was
even
in
the
very
worst
of
times
you
film
any
of
that
well

what
the
hell
are
we
doing
here

writing
for
travel
and
fucking
leisure
were
here
for
one
purpose
and
one
purpose
only
and
thats
to
get
some
goddamn
news
footage
here
thats
why
youre
going
to
go
back
out
into
this
mess
and
shoot
something
ridiculous
okay

you
film
it
no

you
fucking
film
it

you
fucking
film
it
i
dont
know
how
to
use
the
fucking
camera
screw
me
simon
gave
me
balls
i
never
even
knew
i
had
of
course

during
our
years
together
i
got
shot
four
times
and
simon
never
got
as
much
as
a
scratch
but
together
we
won
lots
of
awards
simon
liked
to
point
out

however
that
news
awards
were
like
hemorrhoids
eventually

every
asshole
gets
one
but
the
fact
was
simon
was
the
best
in
the
business
and
everyone
knew
it
he
cared
the
most
he
got
the
best
stories
but
things
started
to
change
during
the
winter
of

in
bosnia
all
the
senseless
brutality
of
every
war
we
had
covered
crystallized
in
one
perfect
winter
of
tragedy
and
then
one
day
simon
snapped
i
guess
everyone
snaps
once
in
their
lifetime
at
a
boss
at
a
lover
at
the
world
but
simons
was
a
doozy
and
i
filmed
it
all
recording
it
for
every
journalism
major
to
download
from
here
to
fucking
eternity
we
now
go
to
simon
hunt
in
bosnia
with
the
story
two
years
into
a
civil
war
that
has
ravaged
this
once
multiethnic
country
doctor
boghanovics
bosnian
serb
army
continues
in
its
quest
to
liquidate
the
bosnian
muslims
from
this
region
today
attacking
yet
another
supposed
unprotected
village
at
will
simon

some
are
saying
that
it
was
the
bosnian
muslims
who
attacked
first
causing
this
latest
battle
simon

some
are
saying
it
wasnt
a
battle

franklin
it
wasnt
a
battle

it
was
a
slaughter
well

simon

certain
united
nations
observers
confirm
who
are
you
talking
about

you
talking
about
the
dutch
the
dutch
the
dutch

getting
drunk

twist

your
editor

cut
this
part
out
of
air
timid
little
network

been
many
distinguished
moments
in
television
history

wasnt
one
of
them
after
that

everything
changed
simon

of
course

got
canned
and
i

on
the
other
hand
received
the
opposite
end
of
the
network
spear
i
got
promoted
guess
a
little
reward
for
having
to
endure
the
embarrassment
that
was
simon
hunt
for
all
those
years
i
got
sent
to
new
york
and
was
offered
the
cushiest
job
in
the
business
chief
cameraman
for
franklin
harris
the
network
anchorman
i
suddenly
had
what
everyone
else
wanted
world
capitals
state
dinners
firstclass
jets
and
i
took
advantage
of
every
gift
bag
they
gave
me
simon
had
it
harder
much
harder

simon
hunt
here
in
northern
gaza
he
stumbled
through
a
half
dozen
cable
news
jobs
one
more
demeaning
than
the
next
which
usually
ended
with
him
quitting
or
getting
fired
for
insubordination
got
great
tape
great

great
tape
finally
he
hit
the
bottom
rung
of
a
journalists
career
showing
up
at
a
war
on
nobodys
dime
but
his
own
ill
take
five
hundred
a
world
exclusive
dont
you
owe
me

from
gaza
its
a
shitty
life
soon
after
that

i
stopped
hearing
from
simon
altogether
and
then
he
dropped
completely
off
the
radar
there
were
rumors
of
spottings
in
certain
war
zones
you
wouldnt
even
want
to
fly
over
stories
like
that
and
then
slowly
the
stories
stopped
did
i
miss
the
action
did
i
want
to
go
back
to
the
carnage
and
craziness
the
adrenaline
and
nonstop
erection
that
comes
from
fear
and
death
and
war
and
that
was
the
lie
i
lived
with
watch
the
land
mine

stupid
after

my
friends
whoa

hold
on

duck

this
is
nuts
youre
not
really
supporting
this

are
you
one
time
in
rwanda
simon
decided
he
was
going
to
assassinate
the
leader
of
the
hutus
and
end
the
war
three
days
later

he
was
in
morocco
getting
a
massage
from
a
hooker
named
gladys
simon
has
his
whims

but
this
one
i
am
not
supporting
this
isnt
a
whim
you
know
what
this
means
to
me
okay

we
are
journalists

we
cant
do
this
its
its
unethical
and
and
insane
it
would
be
a
pleasure
to
personally
catch
him
by
ourselves

by
ourselves

we
dont
even
have
any
weapons
if
i
gave
you
a
gun

would
you
know
how
to
use
it
then
what
the
fuck
are
you
complaining
about
the
moment
you
start
drinking
that
bosnian
brandy
the
devils
sitting
in
the
corner
just
laughing
do
we
know
any
actual
facts
at
all

guys
my
buddy
at
newsweek
says
hes
so
afraid
of
getting
caught
that
hes
grown
his
hair
out
and
has
a
full
orthodox
beard
funnycause
i
heard
he
actually
shaved
his
head
hes
bald
as
a
turd
now

what
we
do
know
is
that
the
fox
drives
in
a
convoy
of
orange
cars
all
right
so
we
should
keep
a
lookout
for
them
thats
funny

simon

i
heard
hes
traveling
around
in
a
stolen
un
demining
vehicle
well
then

we
should
keep
an
eye
out
for
that

too
theres
only
a
thousand
un
demining
trucks
in
this
country
why
dont
we
stop
each
one
hey

knock

knock

is
the
fox
in
there
no
okay

well

we
should
be
done
in

what

say


to

years
one
second
hes
pissing
himself
cause
hes
afraid
we
might
actually
run
into
the
fox
the
next
hes
complaining
cause
we
probably
wont
no

im
not
im
not
complaining
im
mocking
the
doctor
is
not
bald
he
is
not
desperate
and
he
is
not
in
celibici
he
is
everywhere
he
know
everything
he
listens
to
everything
you
say
and
if
you
get
close
to
the
fox
if
you
corner
him
then
even
god
cant
help
you
what
the
fuck
was
that
about
a
little
warning
yeah
it
seemed
more
like
a
threat
yeah

beware
of
the
nosy
waiter
with
serbian
pride
actually

it
was
the
first
time
that
i
thought
that
maybe
simon
wasnt
jerking
our
chain
yeah
why
is
that
because
the
guy
in
there
said
that
hes
not
in
celebici
which
means
maybe
he
actually
is
in
celebici
right

unless
hes
really
not
in
celebici
well

thats
a
possibility

too
jeez
holy

in
the
fuck
was
that
about

man
oh

my
god

benjamin

had
nothing
to
do
with
the
fox

just
a
little
local
tradition
to

the
money
that

enjoyed
it

didnt
you
that
pile
of
rubble
used
to
be
a
mosque
now
the
towns
a
hundred
percent
bosnian
serb
no
muslims
left
ethnically
cleansed
for
your
protection
nice
vibe

right
theres
a
reason
they
say
the
river
runs
red
in
foca
what
does
the
cyrillic
say
it
says

dont
touch
him
wait

where
are
you
going
the
police
need
a
good
laugh
war
criminals
believe
it
or
not

we
dont
even
have
a
copy
of
the
complete
indictment
list
you
dont
no
do
you
have
a
copy
i
could
always
xerox
it
miriam

is
the
copier
working
again
word
has
it
theres
a
bunch
of
them
living
right
here
in
foca
unfortunately

were
here
to
reform
the
police
force
not
hunt
for
war
criminals
but
it
wouldnt
be
much
hunting
i
mean

most
of
them
are
listed
right
in
the
phone
book
as
i
said

were
not
authorized
to
arrest
war
criminals
you
are
the
international
police

right
yes
under
the
flag
of
the
united
nations
i
thought
the
un
was
looking
for
war
criminals
we
are

aggressively
theres
a

million
reward

you
know
but
you
said
you
dont
have
an
indictment
list
we
dont
flown
in
from
bonn
very
black
market
i
particularly
like
the
chocolate
ones
with
the
rainbow
sprinkles
you
see

its
the
un
that
are
looking
for
war
criminals
not
the
un
police
task
force
no

not
the
ones
who
could
actually
catch
them
well

thats
one
way
of
looking
at
it
you
got
any
milk
look

were
headed
up
to
celibici
now
we
just
figured
wed
stop
in
and
register
with
you
just
in
case
we
got
killed
or
something
like
that
well

consider
yourselves
registered
miriam

uh

be
a
love
and
get
me
a
tea
four
sugars
oh

and
a
glass
of
milk
is
there
any
word
on
whats
going
up
there
now
well

something
its
third
time
this
year
weve
been
ordered
to
stay
away
from
celibici
suspicious

no
who
ordered
you
un
command
told
us
to
stay
away
for
four
or
five
days
they
tell
the
police
not
to
go
up
to
celebici
i
mean

hes
actually
up
there

i
cant
fucking
believe
this
why
would
they
tell
them
not
to
go
up
there
tell
them
not
to
go
up
there
because
i
dont
want
them
walking
into
a
shootout
now

really
tell
me
the
truth
who
the
fuck
are
you
guys
i
told
you

we
are
journalists
journalists
yeah

you
have
our
press
credentials
very
professionally
done
so

uh

you
are
journalists
who
believe
that
they
can
get
close
to
someone
that
no
one
else
can
yeah

whats
the
problem
i
understand
you
are
journalists
on
a
story
what

you
think
were
just
posing
as
journalists
do
you
like
beer
i
like
beer

do
you
like
beer
lets
get
a
beer
for
a
group
of
un
guards
to
go

its
too
dangerous
for
you
guys
sure

why
not
go
to
celibici
do
the
world
a
favor
im
sorry

are
you
still
insinuating
were
a
cia
hit
squad
or
something
im
sorry

are
you
still
insinuating
youre
journalists
i
know
things
i
know
how
things
operate
ive
been
waiting
for
you
certain
things
need
to
be
taken
care
of
professionally

right
took
me
months
to
gain
the
trust
of
certain
people
who
normally
would
be
protecting
the
fox
thats
how
i
know
you
didnt
just
stumble
on
well

its
been
printed
in
the
press
so
has
the
horoscopes

do
you
believe
them
youre
not
making
any
sense
now

i
know
im
the
united
nations
and
fact
is

the
united
nations
oh

fuck

the
french
specifically
they
have
no
interest
in
catching
the
fox
they
would
be
happy
if
he
killed
all
the
muslims
save
them
all
this
money
and
energy
john
major
and
the
british
backed
the
fox
and
the
americans
yeah

they
brokered
the
peace
agreement
but
some
would
suggest
they
made
a
secret
deal
with
the
fox
that
if
he
stepped
down
from
power
they
would
not
arrest
him
for
war
crimes
who
knows
whats
true

what
isnt
the
whole
fucking
thing
is
dirty
but
in
dirty
times
dirty
deeds
need
to
be
done

right
one
arm
of
the
government
said
it
would
do
something

does
nothing
that
would
be
us
the
other
hand
cia
whoever
does
something
else
i
mean

look
at
you
guys
do
you
really
think
youre
fooling
anyone
he
thinks
were
a
hit
squad
he
thinks
were
a
fucking
hit
squad
yeah

this
cant
be
good
isnt
it
illegal

impersonating
a
cia
officer
yeah

but
we
denied
it
yeah

he
didnt
believe
it
its
true

its
like
the
more
we
fucking
denied
it
the
more
he
didnt
believe
it
yeah

the
problem
is

if
you
were
cia
you
would
deny
it
and
if
you
werent

you
would
also
deny
it
actually
hes
not
that
far
off
the
mark

you
know
i
mean

were
not
cia
but
we
can
do
a
lot
more
than
just
interview
the
fox
wait

hold
up
simon

what
now

youre
not
still
on
this
capturing
jag
its
not
a
jag
not
a
jag

not
a
whim

especially
now
especially
since
boris
basically
confirmed
that
hes
hiding
out
up
there
okay

now

now

simon
but
we
are
not
capturing
him
i
mean

look
at
us
thats
not
what
we
do
im
checking
into
that
hotel
down
the
road
im
taking
a
shower

a
shit

and
a
seconal
tomorrow
morning
im
getting
up
im
driving
up
that
mountain
to
celibici
and
i
am
finding
the
fox
now

youre
welcome
to
join
me

duckie
or

your
choice
you

crazy
too

huh
i
mean

just
trying
to
get
an
interview
is
crazy
but
were
not
mercenaries
yeah

well

im
supposed
to
be
on
fucking
vacation
and
it
makes
sense
why
he
had
a
meltdown
on
air
hes
a
goddamn
nut
job
yeah

simon
is
a
goddamn
nut
job
but
his
meltdown
wasnt
for
nothing
wed
seen
some
horrible
stuff
that
day
yeah

reporters
see
horrible
things
all
the
time
thats
what
they
do
look

i
saw
the
tape

okay
he
was
drunk

high
he
just
fucking
lost
it
he
lost
it
then

and
hes
losing
it
now
there
was
these
two
girls

right
named
marda
and
una
they
said
they
were
cousins
but
we
used
to
hang
out
together
from
time
to
time
who
the
hell
knows
why
they
were
there
it
was
war
people
was
broke
people
did
things
all
i
know
is
we
had
a
good
time
they
were
our
friends
somewhere
along
the
line
maybe
the
second
or
third
year
into
the
war
simon
and
marda

they
had
a
little
thing
hell

it
was
more
than
a
little
thing
simon

he
liked
her
he
did
things
for
her
whatever
little
money
he
had

he
gave
her
they
didnt
spend
that
much
time
together
but
it
was
war

how
can
you
but
simon

in
his
own
little
crazy
way
he
loved
her
now

you
fastforward
six
months
sarajevos
under
siege
worse
than
ever
and
we
havent
heard
from
marda
or
her
cousin
for
months
now
and
only
thing
we
knew
was
that
marda
had
gone
back
to
polje
to
help
out
her
mother
and
then
one
day
we
hear
about
a
serious
incident
in
polje
and
we
go
there
to
cover
it
the
horrors
we
saw
fucking
inhuman
neither
simon
nor
i
said
anything
we
just
got
ready
to
do
our
job
cover
our
story
inez
jasmine
amar
amin
how
about
aidan
or
how
about
simon
junior
and
then
there
she
was
twenty
minutes
before
we
went
on
the
air
they
had
shot
her
in
her
stomach
five
times
so
dont
believe
everything
that
you
learn
in
journalism
school
cause
in
war
what
you
see
and
what
really
happened
are
sometimes
two
very
different
things

arrested
for
what
impersonating
a
cia

is
a
serious
offense
jesus

we
never
impersonated
anyone
your
friend
boris
is
on
a
plane
for
uganda
where
he
will
now
be
stationed
but
before
he
was
suddenly
transferred
to
darkest
africa
to
never
be
heard
from

we
confronted
him
about
your
little
representation
if
i
ever
hear
from
you
again
the
cia
will
be
on
you
like
a
cheap
suit
from
the
mens
wearhouse
youll
be
arrested

jailed
and
sodomized
by
a
big

dumb

largecocked
serbian
bastard
for
the
rest
of
your
shitty
little
lives
and
if
you
dont
care
about
that

if
you
like
big
serbian
cock
and
you
still
plan
on
reporting
any
of
this
then
your
friend
boris
will
find
himself
eaten
or
whatever
fucking
animal
we
can
find
in
darkest
africa
and
youll
have
to
live
with
that
i
assume
that
i
can
quote
you
on
the
squirrel
remark
look

cunt
the
cia
has
a
bright
side

the
cia
has
a
dark
side
and
then

the
gray
side
we
do
the
things
that
people
dont
need
to
know
about
its
a
part
we
deny
even
exists
its
a
part
of
the
cia
thats
been
working
for
and
what
have
you
been
working
on
doing

letting
him
disappear
let
me
ask
you
a
question
why
do
you
think
the
cia
would
want
to
let
a
war
criminal
go
let
me
ask
you
a
question
in
five
years

why
has
the
cia
if
you
actually
wanted
to
find
him
were
giving
you
a
oneway
ticket
home
i
suggest
you
use
it
were
not
saving
your
asses
again
from
this
moment
on

the
storys
being
written
by
others
the
americans

yeah

they
brokered
the
peace
agreement
but
some
would
suggest
they
made
a
secret
deal
with
the
fox
that
if
he
stepped
down
from
power
they
would
not
arrest
him
for
war
crimes
you
ever
flown
in
one
of
these
puppies
before
you
wont
have
feeling

but
youd
never
believe
me
anyway
mirjana
did

idea

how
the
three
of
us
could
catch
him
you
see

you
cant
go
hunting

he

he
met
a
woman
that
day
and
spent
a
night
in
an
abandoned
rundown
house
he
wasnt
sure
if
it
was
the
bowl
of
gruel

or
the
woman
that
made
him
feel
that
he
was
still
alive
where
can
i
get
some
rice
to
eat
go
wait
in
front
of
the
old

that
on
the
first
day
he
met
me
the
sky
was
ashen

just
like
his
mood

vividly

that

he
later
said

that
we
were
foolishly
brave
to
dare
to
steal
from
troops
i
replied

that
there
was
no
food
within
a

mile
radius
when
youre
about
to
die
from
starvation

i
doesnt
matter
whos
provisions
they
are
charge
out
kill
quick
kill
the
leader
that
day

not
only
did
he
save
me
he
also
taught
me
when
beating
a
snake

you
must
beat
it

inches

to
catch
a
thief

you
must
first
catch
the
king
brother
wuyang
look
it
was
from
that
person
thats
what
generals
wear
brother
wuyang
is
a
general
what
are
you
thinking
about
my
home
theyre
back
dont
be
impatient

come

we
have
food
tonight
were
going
to
have
a
feast
why
are
you
alone
i
ran
away
from
home
by
your
accent

you
are
from
yangzhou
you
picked
up
on
it
how
did
you
pick
that
i
had
a
yangzhou
accent
have
you
heard
of
the
yangzhou
market
that�s
where
they
pick
out
the
prettiest
girls

teach
them
the
arts
and
after
theyve
grown
up

sell
them
to
rich
men
as
wives

right
but
when
i
was
and
about
to
be
sold
a
childhood
friend
stole
me
back
he
even
killed
someone
and
took
me
to
hide
in
the
mountains
as
a
felon
he
didnt
realize
that
youd
changed

and
thought
that
he
was
saving
you
he
is
a
good
person
rest
in
peace
big
brothers
rules
leave
an
empty
place
at
the
table
with
a
full
cup

to
honor
the
dead
were
you
a
commander
in
the
army
its
in
the
past
now
why
did
you
leave
come

drink
we
were
imperial
troops

and
had
agreed
to
join
up
to
eliminate
the
enemy
the
kui
army
promised
but
did
not
deliver
and
we
could
not
suppress
the
enemy
so
all
of
my
men
died
the
world
is
big

but
not
bigger
than
the
bond
between
brothersinarms
without
comrades
life
is
not
worth
living
wuyang
will
the
new
people
in
the
village

stay
with
rice
to
eat

who
will
leave

one
named
pang

who
is
quite
impressive
whether
he
will
leave

i
do
not

i
got
it
from
a
body
no
idea
a
protection
charm

that
night

a
dream
if
youd
already
run
away
why
did
you
come
back
ive
run
away
many
times
it
seems
a
good
idea
but
each
time
i
come
back
ones
fate
should
be
decided
by
oneself
hide
here
why
are
you
taking
our
food

a
chance
today
report
yourselves
to
the
imperial
government
if
we

itd
still
be
suicide
living
like
this

id
rather
die
being
a
bandit
is
a
dogs
life
always
on
the
run
why
dont
we
join
the
army
in
the
army

wed
get
paid
with
the

with

noone

dare
attack
us
the
village
would
have
true
peace
we
are
bandits
would
the
government
accept
us
the
kui
army
is
a
big
military
power
they
wont
even
bother
with
our
little
band
but
chengong
needs
manpower
his
lu
army
is
constantly
being
harassed
by
the
kui
army
and
he
wants
to
be
a
major
military
power
if
we
side
with
him

it
would
be
perfect
timing
erhu

grasp
this
opportunity
and
let
todays
events

never
happen
again
fine
bandits
we
have
to
be
the
best
in
the
past
you
were
a
qing
soldier
now
you

danger
together
in
prosperity
or
difficulty
if
an
outsider
disrupts
our
brotherhood
by

they
must
die
if
a
brother
disrupts
our
brotherhood
with
the
heaven
and
earth
as
our
witness
together
in
one
heart
he
later
told
me
he
didnt
believe
in
blood
oaths
i
asked
what
he
did
believe
in
he
said
that
he
believed

is
how
my
battalion
of

a
battle
of
ruthlessness
comrades

of
the
emotion
that
i

first
take
are

going
to
havenbrook
or
women
now
you
need
a
note
from
your
parents
for
havenbrook

going
to
go
to

now

just
cause
they
help
out
women
now
do
you
want
me
to
call
for
you
because
i
called
for
becky
last
year

do
need
your
help
with
something

its
like
critically
important
you

heavy
lifting

really
only
help
you
at
this
point
so

you
were
bored
thats
how
this
blessed
miracle
came
to
be
no

the
act
was
premeditated

i
mean

the
sex

not
the
whole
lets
get
pregnant
thing
so

when
did
you
decide
that
you
were
gonna
do
bleeker
a
year
ago
in
spanish
class
you
love
him
its
actually
really
complicated

ok
and
i
dont
feel
like
talking
about
it
in
my
fragile
state
so
what
was
it
like
humping
bleeks
bony
bod
hey

bleek
wicked
tiger
it
looks
proud
i
swiped
it
from
ms

rancicks
lawn
wow

your
shorts
are
like
especially
gold
today
my
mom

colorsafe
bleach

carole
ill
tell
her
when
i
see
them
all
running
like
that

with
their
things
bouncing
around
in
their
shorts
i
always
picture
them
naked

even
if
i
dont
want
to

all
i
see
is
pork
swords
im
supposed
to
be
running
so
guess
what
what
i
dont
know
what
should
we
do
oh

you
know

i
was
thinking
id
just
nip
it
in
the
bud
before
it
gets
worse
because
they
were
talking
about
it
in
health
class
how
pregnancy
can
often
lead
to
an
infant
typically

yeah

yeah
thats
what
happens
when
our
moms
and
teachers
get
pregnant
so

youre
cool
with
that
then
yeah

yeah

wizard

you
know
do
whatever
you
think
you
should
do

you
know
well

im
sorry
i
had
sex
with
you

it
wasnt
your
idea
whose
idea
was
it
ill
see
you
at
school

alright
hey

your
book
fell
apart
it
must
have
looked
at
your
face
the
funny
thing

that
steve
rendazo
secretly
wants
me
jocks
like
him

freaky
girls
girls
with
hornrimmed
glasses
and
vegan
footwear
and
goth
makeup
girls
who

the
cello
and
read
mcsweeneys
and
want
to
be
children�s
librarians
when
they
grow
up
oh
yeah

jocks
totally
eat
that
shit
up
they
just
won�t
admit
it

into
perfect
cheerleaders

into
teachers

smirnoff
ices
and
a
bottle
of
snow
peak
peach
flavored
boone�s
good

oprimo
numero
dos

sexually
active
what

a
permanent

a
dentist
office
in
there
and
there
were
these
horrible
magazines
with
water
stains
and
then
the
friggin
receptionist
is
trying
to
give
me
these
condoms
that
looked
like
grape
suckers
and
just
babbling
away
about
her
friggin
boyfriend�s
pie
balls
yum

there

she
was
like

your
vag
on
the
way

i�m
staying
pregnant

leah
dude
you
gotta
keep
your
voice
down

my
mom
is
inside
she
doesn�t
know
that
we�re
sexually
active
ive
been
thinking
i
was
thinking
that
i
could
have
this
baby
and
give
it
to
someone
who
totally
needs
it
you
know

like
a
woman
with
a
bum
ovary
or
a
couple
of
nice
lesbos
but
then
you�re
gonna
get
huge
and
your
chest
is
gonna
milktate
and
you
have
to
tell
people
that
you�re
pregnant

but
maybe
they�ll
canonize
me
for
being
so
selfless
maybe
they�ll
totally
shit
and
be
really
mad
and
not
let
you
graduate
or
go
to
cabo
for
spring
break
i
was
going
to
go
to
gettysburg
with
bleeker
anyway
you
should
look
at
adoption
ads
i
see
them
all
the
time
in
the
penny
saver
they
have
ads
for
parents
yeah
desperately
seeking
spawn

right
next
to
terriers
and
iguanas
and
used
fitness
equipment
it�s
totally
legit
wholesome

spiritually
wealthy
couple
have
found
true
love
with
each
other
all
that�s
missing
is
your
bastard
i
want
a
parakeet
you�re
totally
not
even
listening
to
me
no

i
heard
you

i
dont
want
to
give
the
baby
to
a
family
that
describes
themselves
as
wholesome
why
i
want
something
a
little
more
edgier
okay

what
did
you
have
in
mind
exactly
i
was
thinking
a
graphic
designer
midthirties

with
a
cool
asian
girlfriend
who
dresses
awesome
and
rocks
out
on
the
bass
guitar
but
i
dont
want
to
be
too
particular
ok

how
about
this
educated

successful
couple
seeking
infant
to
join
our
family
of
five
you
will
be
compensated

help
us
complete
the
circle
of
love
that
sounds
great
they
sound
like
a
friggin
cult

besides

they
already
have
three
kids

theyre
greedy
little
bitches
oh

juno
how
about
this
one
they
were
mark
and
vanessa
loring
and
they
were
beautiful
even
in
black
and
white
paul

you
coming
downstairs
to
eat

but
it�s
breakfast
for

your
favorite

paul
juno
macguff
called
while
you
were
out
running
today
you
know
how
i
feel
about
her
you�ve
mentioned
it
a
couple
times
different
im
not
really
sure
how
im
gonna
spit
this
out
hon

did
you
get
expelled
no

the
school
would
most
likely
contact
you
in
the
event
of
my
expulsion
well

i
was
just
asking

it
seemed
plausible
do
you
need
a
large
amount
of
money
legal
counsel
no

i�m
not
asking
for
anything
except
for
maybe
mercy

like

it
would
be
friggin
sweet
if
no
one
hit
me
what
have
you
done

junebug
did
you
hit
someone
with
the
previa
dude

think
its
best
to
just
tell
them
but
i�m
going
to
give
it
up
for
adoption
i
already
found
the
perfect
couple
theyre
gonna
pay
for
the
medical
expenses
and
everything
in
thirtyodd
weeks
we
can
just
pretend
that
this
never
happened
i�m
sorry

and
if
it
is
any
consolation
i
have
heartburn
that�s
radiating
down
to
my
kneecaps
and
i
haven�t
take
a
dump

right
right

this
is
no
laughing
matter
no

its
not
and
paulie
is
actually
great
in
chair
you
were
thinking
about
adoption
yeah

there�s
this
couple
they�ve
been
trying
to
have
a
kid
for
five
years
we
found
them
in
the
penny
saver
next
to
the
exotic
birds
they
have
a
legitimate
lawyer
and
i
was
going
to
go
meet
with
them
next
weekend
junebug

that
is
a
tough

tough
thing
to
do
probably
tougher
than
you
can
understand
right
now
its
just
that
i�m
not
ready
to
be
a
mom
damn
skippy

you�re
not
you
don�t
even
remember
to
give
liberty
bell
her
breathing
meds
that
was
once
and
she
did
not
die

if
you
recall
honey

had
you
considered

you
know

the
alternative
well

you�re
a
little
viking
first
things
first
we
have
to
get
you
healthy
you
need
prenatal
vitamins
incidentally

they
do
incredible
things
for
your
nails

so
that�s
a
plus
oh

and
we
need
to
schedule
a
doctor�s
appointment

out
where
you�re
going
to
deliver
juno

coming
with
you
to
meet
this
adoption

dummy

am
not
ready

a
poppop

to
be

garbage
dump
of
a
situation

sat
us
down

drugs

was
my
first
instinct
too

mark

please

up
she�s
kidding
junebug
has
a
wonderful
sense
of
humor

just
one
of
her
many
genetic
gifts
so

juno

first
off

how
far
along
are
you
i�m
a
junior
no

i
mean
in
your
pregnancy
oh

uh

actually
my
stepmom
took
me
yesterday
to
the
doctor
and
they
said
i
was
twelve
weeks
oh

that�s
marvelous
so
you�re
into
your
second
trimester
yeah

apparently
i�m
due
on
may
my
girlfriends
tell
me
the
first
couple
months
are
the
hardest
i
didnt
notice
it
at
all
i�m
more
concerned
about
when
they
have
to
put
that
elastic
band
in
the
front
of
my
jeans
i
think
pregnancy
is
beautiful
well

you�re
lucky
it�s
not
you
so

let�s
talk
how
we�re
gonna
do
this
thing
well

dont
i
just
have
the
thing
squeeze
it
on
out
and
hand
it
over
mark
and
vanessa
are
willing
to
negotiate
an
open
adoption
it
means
they�d
send
annual
updates

photos
let
juno
know
how
the
baby
is
doing
as
he
or
she
grows
up
whoah

i
don�t
want
photos
or
any
kind
of
notification
can�t
we
just
kick
this
old
school
i
stick
the
baby
in
a
basket
and
send
it
your
way
like
moses
in
the
reeds
technically

that
would
be
kickin�
it
old
testament
exactly
right
like
in
the
good
old
days

when
it
was
quick
and
dirty
well

then
we
all
agree
a
traditional
closed
adoption
would
be
best
for
all
involved
shit

yes

just
close
her
on
up
obviously

we
would
compensate
you
for
all
your
medical
expenses
are
you
looking
for
any
other
type
of
compensation
no

i
dont
want
to
sell
the
thing

i
just
i
just
want
the
baby
to
be
with
people
who
are
gonna
love
it
and
be
good
parents

you
know
i�m
in
high
school

beautiful
and

really
tight
band
when
i
lived
in
chicago
and
one
night
we
opened
up
for
the
melvins
and
i
busted
that
thing
right
on
stage
and
it
cost
me

just
to

fixed
when

that
�

best
time
for
rock
and
roll
nuhuh


punk
volume
you
couldnt
understand
the
magic
you

even
alive
its
a
pilates
machine
what
do
you
make
with
it
you
don�t
make
anything

it�s
for
exercising
my
wife
ordered
one
of
those
tony
little
gazelles
off
the
tv
you
know

from
the
guy
with
the
ponytail
that
guy
just
doesn�t
look
right
to
me
youre
playing
music
juno
wanted
a
little
closer
look
at
kimber
your
guitar
is
named
kimber
that�s
cool

my
axe
is
named
roosevelt
after
franklin

not
ted

he
was
the
hot
one
with
polio
gerta
is
downstairs

we
still
have
a
lot
of
stuff
to
go
over
not

interrupt
the
jam
session
so

just
look
these
over
and
if
you
have
any
questions

call
me
at
my
office
we
would
really
appreciate
it
if

nature
for

oh

thank
goodness
for

it�s
obviously
a
poisonous
environment
to
raise
a
baby
in
how
do
you
know
that
i�m
so
poisonous
what
if
these
adoptive
parents
turn
out
to
be
evil
molesters
or
like
stage
parents
they
could
be
utterly
negligent

maybe
they�ll
do
a
far
shittier
job
of
raising
a
kid

my
dumbass
stepdaughter
ever
would

considered
that

what
is
your
job
title

i�m
an
ultrasound
technician

special

pages

five
yearold
daughter

tanning
bed
so

whatd
i
tell
ya
you
have
decent
taste
in
slasher
movies
here�s
to
dovetailing
interests
have
you
guys
thought
of
any
names
for
the
baby
yet
sort
of

yes

vanessa
likes
madison
for
a
girl
madison
isnt
that
a
little

gay
well

pretentious
much
should
everyone
just
have
a
mysterious
name
like
juno
my
dad
went
through
this
huge
obsession
with
roman
and
greek
mythology
he
decided
to
name
me
after
zeus�s
wife
zeus
had
tons
of
lays

but
i�m
pretty
sure
juno
was
his
only
wife
she
was
supposed
to
be
really
beautiful
but
really
mean

like
diana
ross
that
suits
you
you�re
something
else
vanessa

youd
better
go
she
hates
when
i
sit
around
watching
movies
and
i
dont
contribute
i�ll
handle
this

i�m
really
good
at
diffusing
momtype
rage
no

juno

no
juno

whats
going
on
nothing

what
are
you
doing
here
whats
wrong
nothing

i
went
to
the
doctor
today
is
there
something
wrong
with
the
baby
the
baby
is
great
it�s
the
right
size
and
everything

i
even
saw
its
phalanges
today
its
the
baby
it
kinda
looks
like
it�s
waving
like
it�s
saying
hey

vanessa

will
you
be
my
mom
yeah

it
kind
of
does
juno
was
nice
enough
to
bring
that
over
for
us
today
i
came
as
soon
as
i
got
that
ultrasound
goo
off
my
pelvis
it
was
crazy
actually
my
stepmom
verbally
abused
the
ultrasound
tech
so
we
got
escorted
off
the
premises
wow

what
kind
of
swag
did
you
score
mall
madness

huh
it�s
just
some
stuff
i
picked
up
for
the
baby
dont
you
usually
get
all
that
stuff
at
a
baby
shower
when
my
stepmom
was
pregnant
with
my
little
sister
she
got
a
million
gifts
but
i
wasnt
jealous
cause
they
all
were
super
lame
i
doubt
anyone�s
gonna
throw
us
a
shower
why
wouldnt
they
throw
you
a
baby
shower
i
dont
think
people
know
how
to
feel
about
this
situation
because
it�s
not
set
in
stone
what
isnt
set
you
dont
think
i�m
going
to
flake
out
on
you
no

i
don�t

juno
we
went
through
a
situation
before
where
it
didn�t

in
the
first
place
they

you
drive
an
hour
out
to
east
jesus

nowhere
i
don�t

just
did
and
while

and
i
were
waiting

the
wizard
of
gore
and
he
burned
me
a
couple
of
cds
of
this
weird
music
juno

cant
just
drop
in
on
them
like
that

was
not
a
big
deal

he
was
totally
cool

it
mark
is
a
married
man

there
are
boundaries
listen
brenduhhh

acting
like
you�re
the
one
who
has
to
go
through
this
and
get
huge
and
shove
a
baby
out
of
your
vag
for
someone
else
what
does
it
even
matter
if
he�s
married
i
can
have
friends
that
are
married
it
doesn�t
work
that
way

kiddo
you
don�t
know
squat
about
the
dynamics
of
marriage
you
don�t
know
anything
about
me
i
know
enough
we
dont
even
have
a
dog
yeah

because
you�re
allergic
to
their
saliva
i
have
sacrificed
a
lot
for
you

juno

but
in
a
couple
years
when
you
move
out
i�m
going
to
get
weimaraners
wow

dream
big
oh

go
fly
a
kite
what
can
i
do
for
you
bleeker
home
bleeker�s
mom
was
possibly
attractive
once
but
now
she
looks
a
hobbit
you
know

the
fat
one
that
was
in
the
goonies
don�t
concentrate
so
hard

i
think
i
can
smell
your
hair
all
burning
hey

what�s
up
not
much

i
just
wanted
to
come
say
hey
i
miss
hanging
out
with
you
on
school
nights
orange
tictacs
are
bleeker�s
one
and
only
vice
the
day
i
got
pregnant

his
mouth
tasted
really
tangy
and
delicious
you
seem
to
be
getting
pregnanter
these
days
ya
know

i
set
up
this
whole
private
adoption
and
this
married
couple
in
saint
cloud
are
going
to
be
the
parents
what
are
they
like
the
guy

hes
awesome
his
name
is
mark
and
he
likes
old
horror
movies
and
he
plays
the
guitar
we
actually
hung
out
this
afternoon
is
that
normal
probably
not

but
i
talked
to
dad
and
bren
and
they
said
they
wouldnt
narc
you
out
to
your
folks
i
think
we
should
be
cool
i�m
gonna
start
looking
like
a
pretty
big
dork
soon
will
you
still
think
i�m
cute
when
i�m
huge
i
always
think
you�re
cute
i
think
you�re
beautiful
jeez

bleek
i
do
hey
junebug

when
this
is
all
over
we
should
get
the
band
back
together
that
would
be
awesome
once
tino
gets
a
new
drumhead
were
just

like

ready
to
rock
we
could
always
get
back
together
too
thats
an
option
were
we
together
yeah

we
were
once
that
time
what
about
katrina
de
voort
you
could
totally
go
out
with
katrina
de
voort
i
don�t
like
katrina
she
smells
like
soup
her
whole
house
smells
of
soup
so
we
have
custard

cheesecake
theyre
yellow
i
wanted
to
pick
something
that
was
genderneutral
until
we
get
the
baby
and
then
we
can
add
a
more
decisive
palette
why
does
everyone
think
yellow
is
genderneutral
i
don�t
know
any
guy
with
a
yellow
bedroom
im
thinking
more
custard
with
this
light
i
don�t
know

maybe
i
should
paint
a
larger
swatch
or
you
could
wait
a
few
more
months
it�s
not
like
the
baby�s
going
to
storm
in
here
demanding
dessertcolored
walls
what
to
expect
says
that
readying
the
baby�s
room
is
an
important
process
for
the
woman
especially
if
youre
adopting

it�s
called
nesting
nesting
are
you
going
to
build
the
crib
out
of
sticks
and
spit
you
should
read
the
book

i
flagged
the
daddy
chapters
for
you
i
think
it�s
too
early
to
paint
i
disagree
this
wall
is
going
to
need
something
our
first
family
photo

the
middle

of
precious

point

i
have
to
actually
wear
a
friggin
bra
now
and
rub
all
this
nasty
cocoa
butter
stuff
on
myself
so
my
skin
wont
explode
hot
why
is
everyone
always
staring
at
me
well

you
are
kind
of
convex

you
know
whoah
whos
been
doing
their
geometry
homework
for
once
i
have
no
choice

keith
has
been
grading
me
so
hard
lately
do
not
call
mr

conyers
keith
cause
my
barf
reflex
is
really
enheightened
these
days
but
keith�s
hot
eww

he�s
all
beardy
did
you
hear
that
bleek
is
going
to
the
prom
with
katrina
de
voort
no
way

he
doesn�t
like
katrina
must
be
like
a
pity
date
or
something
i
heard
he
asked
her
and
that
there
going
to
benihana
and
then
prom

and
then
vijay�s
parents�
cabin
he
told
me
that
katrina�s
house
smells
like
soup
oh
my
god

it
totally
does
i
was
there
four
years
ago
for
her
birthday
party
and
it
was
like
lipton
landing
but
you
know

boys
have
endured
way
worse
things
for
nookie
there
is
no
way
that
they�re
having
sex
they
wouldnt
even
be
holding
hands
i
wouldn�t
be
so
sure

he
did
it
with
you
yeah

cause
bleek
trusts
me
we�re
best
friends
are
you
jealous
i
thought
you
said
you
didn�t
care
what
he
did
not
jealous

don�t
care
i
know
bleek
doesn�t
like
katrina
and
he
shouldnt
toy
with
her
emotions
like
that

she
seems
pretty
nice
uhhuh

i�m
really
convinced
prom
is
for
wenises

anyway
as
soon
as
you�re
old
enough
to
go

it�s
so
not
cool
anymore
are
you
honestly
and
truly
going
to
the
prom
with
katrina
de
voort
leah
just
said
that
you
were
gonna
go
with
her
yeah

i
did
ask
her
if
she
wanted
to
go
a
bunch
of
us
from
the
team
are
going
to
benihana
then
go
the
prom

then
go
to
vijay�s
parents�
cabin
we�re
getting
a
stretch
limo
your
mom
must
be
pretty
stoked
that
you�re
not
taking
me
you�re
mad

why
are
you
mad
i�m
not
mad

i�m
in
a
great
mood
despite
the
fact
that
i�m
in
a
fat
suit
i
can�t
take
off
despite
the
fact
that
pretty
much
everyone
is
making
fun
of
me
behind
my
back

despite
the
fact
that
your
girlfriend
gave
me
the
stinkeye
in
art
class
yesterday
katrina�s
not
my
girlfriend
and
i
doubt
that
she
gave
you
the
stinkeye
thats
just
the
way
her
face
looks
just
take
soupy
sales
to
prom

i
can
think
of
so
many
cooler
things
to
do
that
night
i
might
pumice
my
feet
or
go
to
bren�s
unitarian
church
maybe
get
hit
by
a
truck
full
of
hot
garbage
juice
all
those
things
would
be
exponentially
cooler
than
going
to
the
prom
with
you
you�re
being
really
immature
you
have
no
reason
to
be
mad
at
me

you
broke
my
heart
i
should
be
royally
ticked
off
at
you
i
should
be
really
cheesed
off

i
shouldn�t
want
to
talk
to
you
anymore
why
because
i
got
bored
and
had
sex
with
you

and
then
i
didn�t
wanna

like

marry
you
like
i�d
marry
you
youd
be
the
meanest
wife
ever
and
i
know
that
you

bored
that
day
because
there
was
a
lot
of
stuff

your
virginity

you
shut

me
feel
way
less

a
fat
dork

same
condition

that�s
one
big

fat
sack

your
weird
life

my
life
has
become

got
stuff
in
boxes

appealing
to
you

my
fault

at
you

in
love
when

total
ahole
oh

another
sonic
youth
album
and

just
noise
juno
what�s
going
on
i�m
not
crying

i�m
just
allergic
to
fine
home
furnishings
she�s
just
a
little
hormonal

right

juno
it�s
part
of
the
process
i
didn�t
do
anything
what
just
thinking
if
this
is
the
right
thing
what
are
you
talking
about
just
wondering
if
its
just
wondering
if
were
ready
yeah

were
ready
we�re
ready

weve
read
the
books

we�ve
taken
all
the
classes
we
have
a
nursery
that
is
completely
vanessa

i
know
we�re
prepared

im
just
wondering
if
i�m
ready
juno

don�t
listen
to
him

hes
just
got
cold
feet
hes
just
being
a
guy
the
books
all
say
the
same
thing
a
woman
becomes
a
mother
when
she
gets
pregnant
a
man
becomes
a
father
when
he
sees
his
baby
he�s
going
to
get
there
it
just
happened
so
fast
we
put
the
ad
in
the
paper
and
i
thought
it
was
gonna
take
months
if
at
all
and
then
two
weeks
later

she�s
on
that
couch
she
answered
our
prayers
ever
since
then
it�s
been
like
a
ticking
clock
what
are
you
saying
that
it
feels
a
little
like
bad
timing
what
would
be
a
good
time
for
you

mark
there�s
just
some
things
that
i
still
want
to
do
like
what
be
a
rock
star
don�t
mock
me
im
just
saying
that
this
is
this
is
something
thats
never
going
to
happen
your
shirt
is
stupid
grow
up
if
i
have
to
wait
for
you
to
become
kurt
cobain
i�m
never
going
to
be
a
mother
i
never
said
i�d
be
a
good
father
i
called
gerta
rauss
and
she
said
that
she
can
represent
both
of
us
its
called
a
collaborative
divorce
it�s
all
the
rage
right
now

supposedly
and
it
would
be
pretty
easy
because
we
don�t
have
any
children
thanks
for
making
the
call

i
guess
have
you
found
a
place
to
stay
yet
yeah

downtown

a
hotel
no

its
not
a
hotel

it�s
a
loft
aren�t
you
the
cool
guy

wanted
a
baby
so
bad
it
looks
like
a
bill
from
jiffylube

it�s
for
me
i
never
realize
how
much
i
like
being
home
unless
i�ve
been
somewhere
really
different
for
a
while
hey

big
puffy
version
of
junebug
dealing
with
things
way
beyond
my
maturity
level
where
is
everybody
bren
took
liberty
bell
to
her
tot
ice
skating
class
when
will
you
guys
learn
that
tots
can�t
ice
skate
youre
looking
a
little
morose

honey
what�s
eating
you
i�m
just

like

losing
my
faith
with
humanity
can
you
narrow
that
down
for
me
wonder
if
two
people
can
stay
together
for
good
you
mean
like
couples
yeah

like
people
in
love
are
you
having
boy
trouble
cause
i
gotta
be
honest
i
don�t
really
much
approve
of
you
dating
in
your
condition
that�s
kind
of
messed
up
no

dad
i
mean

that�s
pretty
skanky
isn�t
that
what
you
girls
call
it
skanky
skeevy
please
stop
tore
up
from
the
floor
up
thats
not
what
its
about
i
just
need
to
know
that
it�s
possible
that
two
people
can
stay
happy
together
forever
it�s
not
easy

that�s
for
sure
i
dont
have
the
best
track
record
in
the
world

i
know

but
ive
been
with
your
stepmother
for
ten
years
now
and
i�m
proud
to
say
that
we�re
very
happy
in
my
opinion
the
best
thing
you
can
do
is
find
a
person
who
loves
you
for
exactly
what
you
are
good
mood

bad
mood

ugly

pretty
handsome

what
have
you
the
right
person
is
still
gonna
think
the
sun
shines
out
of
your
ass
that�s
the
kind
of
person
that�s
worth
sticking
with
i
think
ive
found
that
person
yeah

sure
you
have

your
old
dad
you
know
i�ll
always
be
there
to
love
you

support
you

no
matter

wont
be
home

the
coolest
person

not
like
everyone
else

stare
at
my
stomach

at
my
face
and
every
time
i
see
you

the
baby
starts
kicking
super
hard
it

think
it�s

heart
starts
pounding
everytime

all
i
could
ask

you�re
golden

matter
to
him
because
you
entered
our
small
bet
in
the
false
pretensions

i
the
friend
��
and
so
that
you
could
remember
to
be
franker
in
the
future
you
will
be
giving
half
of
your

me

to

not

much
��
yes

very
amiable
you

so
that
you

i
simply
was
lowers
and
foreign
irish
who
you
contracted
for
a
pair
of
weeks
sweeping
to
the
hair
but
i
remember
it
i
could
seat
just
and
watch
it

and
dream
here
about
the
day
so

we
make
a
treatment
or
would
have
to
be
running
to
the
street
by
my
friend
beadle
bamford
what
now
says
to
that
mr

sweeney
todd

terrible
eyetalian
received

temper

abomination

mr

because
you

behind
another
one
because

a
man
can
require
but
that
enamored
like
thus
pretty
women
to
those
who
loved
this
world
and
knew
friendly
company
therein
this
reunion
is
for
you
years
earlier
northern
cave
tseng
look
at
this
pay
dirt
not
a
pretty
sight

is
it
who
cares
just
get
the
damn
thing
reno

the
chopper
reno

hurry
reno
elena
go
get
out
the
lifestream
thats
what
we
call
the
river
of
life
that
circles
our
planet
giving
life
to
the
world
and
everything
in
it
the
shinra
electric
power
company
discovered
a
way
to
use
the
lifestream
as
an
energy
source
because
of
shinras
energy

we
were
able
to
live
very
comfortable
lives
but
wasnt
that
because
we
were
taking
away
from
the
planets
life
a
lot
of
people
thought
so
shinra
used
their
power
to
try
and
stop
anybody
who
got
in
their
way
shinra
had
a
special
group
of
warriors
called
s
oldier
and
all
the
soldiers
had
jenova
cells
put
inside
them
jenova
was
a
calamity
that
fell
from
the
sky
a
long

long
time
ago
and
tried
to
destroy
the
planet
anyway

there
was
one
s
oldier
named
sephiroth
who
was
better
than
the
rest
but
when
he
found
out
about
the
terrible
experiments
that
made
him
he
began
to
hate
shinra
and
then

over
time

he
began
to
hate
everything
shinra
and
the
people
against
them
sephiroth

who
hated
the
planet
so
much
he
wanted
to
make
it
go
away
and
the
people
who
tried
to
stop
him
there
were
a
lot
of
battles
for
every
battle

there
was
more
sadness
someone
i
love
went
back
to
the
lifestream
too
and
then

it
came
the
chosen
day
in
the
end

the
planet
itself
had
to
make
the
battles
stop
for
good
the
planet
used
the
lifestream
as
a
weapon
and
when
it
burst
out
of
the
earth
all
the
fighting

all
the
greed
and
sadness
everything
was
washed
away
sadness
was
the
price
to
see
it
end
its
been
two
years
since
they
told
me
that
they
call
it
geostigma

ive

you

what

sephiroth
so
they
say
i
dont

sephiroth
but
i
know
hes
close
it

under
my
skin
what
if
mother
loves
him
more
than
poor
little

it
doesnt

youll
meet
the
same
fate
either
way
mother
came
to
this
planet
after
a
long
journey
to
rid
the
cosmos
of
fools
like
you
but
you
know
as
well
as
me
nothings
changed
since
mother
came
here
i
have
to
change
it

to
make
her
happy
theres
nothing
i
wouldnt
do

if
she
only
asked
its
nightmare
junior
as
long
as
you
exist

the
nightmares
will
come
again
and
again
the
lifestream
courses
through
our
planet
back
and
forth
across
the
borders
of
life
and
death
if
that
cycle
is
the
very
truth
of
life
then
history

will
inevitably
repeat
itself

jenovas

spanish

openly
of
mary
stuart
as
queen
of
england
in
waiting
their
loyalty
is
to
the
pope
in
rome
how
many
catholics
are
there
in
england

sir
immense
numbers

majesty
half
the
nation
cling
to
the
old
superstitions
what
would
you
have
me
do
hang
half
the
people
of
england
or
just
imprison
them
we
must
act

majesty
our
inaction
is
perceived
as
weakness
if
my
people
break
the
law

they
shall
be
punished
until
that
day

they
shall
be
protected
majesty

we
have
proven
reason
to
fear
every
catholic
in
the
fear
creates
fear
i
am
not
ignorant
of
the
dangers

sir
but
i
will
not
punish
my
people
for
their
beliefs
only
for
their
deeds
i
am
assured
that
the
people
of
england
love
their
queen
my
constant
endeavor
is
to
earn
that
love
my
queen
our
friends
write
to
give
us
hope
annette

englands
true
believers
will
rise
up

her
throat

enough
slit
her
throat
please
annette
and
when
that
bastard
usurper
is
dead

my
lady
will
be
queen
your
bishops
are
preaching
that
god
is
showing
his
displeasure
because
the
queen
is
still
unmarried
some
rudely
suggesting
infertile
what
nonsense
walsingham
dangerous
nonsense
mary
stuart
has
a
son
why
does

torment
me
with
mary
stuart

in
line
to
the
throne

hide
your
face
walsingham

my
lady

the
natives
you

i
dont
suppose
you
could
get
one
for
me

they
sir
walter
that
depends
on
what
you
propose
to
do

dress

up
in
mulberry
colored
silk
and
have
him
walk
behind

have
a
secret

my
dear
i
pretend
theres
a
pane
of
glass
they
can
see
me

but
they
cannot
touch
me
you
should
try
it
majesty

i
am
sir
walter
it
is
something

after
all
to
take
a
blank
on
the
map
and
build
there
a
shining
city
which
you
will
no
doubt
name
after
yourself
no
doubt
may
i
ask
a
question
in
return
how
am
i
to
win
the
queens
favor
why
should
i
tell
you
that
ive
little
enough
to
offer

but
whatever
i
have
to
give
ask

and
its
yours
say
what
you
mean
to
say
as
plainly
as
possible
all
men
flatter
the
queen
in
hope
of
advancement
pay
her
the
compliment
of
truth
i
dont
even
know
your
name
elizabeth
throckmorton
a
second
elizabeth
everyone
calls
me
bess
man
your
most
serene
majesty

bright
star
of
our
firmament
we
present
our
humble
masque
of
the
heavenly
spheres
elizabeth
his
highness
is
tired
after
his
long
journey
archduke
charles
no
man
can
become
tired
in
the
presence
of
so
lovely
a
queen
speaking
german
his
highness

the
archduke
informs
me
that
my
charms
overwhelm
him
he
will
retire
to
his
private
chambers
to
rest
i
dont
want
him
hurt
by
your
schemes
so
how
should
we
proceed
perhaps
we
should
all
retire
elizabeth
i
suspect
him
of
being
a
professional
charmer
bess
he
is
certainly
charming

my
lady
well

there
are
duller
professions
you
like
him

dont
you
hes
a
man
that
lives
in
a
world
far
beyond
the
court
its
refreshing
we
shall
let
him
come
again
blue
sir
walter
can
you
imagine
what
it
is
to
cross
an
ocean
for
weeks

you
see
nothing
but
the
horizon

perfect
and
empty
you
live
in
the
grip
of
fear
fear
of
storms
fear
of
sickness
on
board
fear
of
the
immensity
so
you
must
drive
that
fear
down
deep
into
your
belly
study
your
charts
watch
your
compass
pray
for
a
fair
wind
and
hope
pure
naked
fragile
hope
hatton
majesty

the
archduke
and
court
are
waiting
let
them
wait
go
on

mr

raleigh
you
were
hoping
sir
walter
at
first

its
no
more
than
a
haze
on
the
horizon
so
you
watch
you
watch
then
its
a
smudge
a
shadow
on
the
far
water
for
a
day
for
another
day
the
stain
slowly
spreads
along
the
horizon
taking
form
until
on
the
third
day

you
let
yourself
believe
you
dare
to
whisper
the
word
land
resurrection
the
true
adventure
coming
out
of
the
vast
unknown
out
of
the
immensity
into
new
life
your
majesty

is
the
new
world
i
like
your
immensities
your
ocean
is
an
image
of
eternity

i
think
such
great
spaces
make
us
small
do
we
discover
the
new
world

mr

raleigh
or
does
the
new
world
discover
us
you
speak
like
a
true
explorer
i
like
you

mr

raleigh
and
i
like
you
you
know

of
course

that
when
i
like
a
man

i
reward
him
i
have
heard
that
and
what
have
you
to
say
about
it
reward
my
mission

majesty

not
me
is
the
mission
not
the
man
then
you
leave
me
free
to
like
you
in
return
i
think
it
must
be
hard
for
so
great
a
queen
to
know
the
simple
pleasure
of
being
liked
for
herself
now
you
grow
dull
elizabeth
come
on
you
have
the
stronger
horse
yours
carries
the
lighter
load
the
queen
does
not
give
way
to
others
whoa
whoa
forgive
me

majesty

my
horse
doesnt
seem
to
know
his
place
yet
have
you
ever
known
your
place

careful
out
of
all
men
that
beg
for
a
chance
to
drill
your
lots
maybe
one
in
twenty
will
be
oil
men
the
rest
will
be
speculators
thats
men
trying
to
get
between
you
and
the
oil
men
to
get
some
of
the
money
that
ought
by
rights
come
to
you
even
if
you
find
one
that
has
money

and
means
to
drill
hell
maybe
know
nothing
about
drilling
and
hell
have
to
hire
out
the
job
on
contract
and
then
youre
depending
on
a
contractor
to
rush
the
job
through
so
he
can
get
another
contract
just
as
quick
as
he
can
this
is
way
that
this
works

what
is
your
offer
were
wasting
time
i
do
my
own
drilling
and
the
men
that
work
for
me

work
for
me
and
they
are
men
i
know
i
make
it
my
business
to
be
there
and
to
see
to
their
work
i
dont
lose
my
tools
in
the
hole
and
spend
months
fishing
for
them
i
dont
botch
the
cementing
off
and
let
water
in
the
hole
and
ruin
the
whole
lease
i
am
a
family
man

i
run
the
family
business
this
is
my
son
and
my
partner
hw

plainview
we
offer
you
the
band

a
family
that
very
view
oil
men
can
understand
im
fixed
like
no
other
company
in
this
field
and
thats
because
my
coyote
hills
well
has
just
come
in
i
have
a
string
of
tools
all
ready
to
put
to
work
i
can
load
a
rig
onto
trucks
and
have
them
here
in
a
week
i
have
business
connections
so
i
can
get
the
lumber
for
the
derrick
such
things
go
by
friendship
in
a
rush
like
this
and
this
is
why
i
can
guarantee
to
start
drilling
and
put
up
the
cash
to
back
my
word
i
assure
you

ladies
and
gentlemen

no
matter
what
the
others
promise
to
do
when
it
comes
to
the
showdown

they
wont
be
there
mr

plainview
mr

plainview
where
are
you
going
i
dont
need
the
lease

thank
you
no

we
need
you
too
much
confusion
thank
you
for
your
time

no

no

no

theres
no
confusion
i
wouldnt
take
the
lease
if

it
to
me
as
a
gift
mr

bankside

im
not
going
to
waste
your
time
i
certainly
you
appreciate
it

if
you
didnt
waste
mine
if
you
wish
to
sign
with
me
we
can
have
a
well
drilling
within
ten
days
your
lot
is
further
north
from
the
discovery
well
up
here
so
it
means
we
will
probably
have
to
dig
deeper
if
theres
as
much
oil
up
here
as
i
think
there
is
it
will
be
harder
to
reach
but
once
we
find
it
we
can
take
it
right
out
but
we
have
to
act
quickly
because
very
soon
these
fields
will
be
dry
i
need
you
to
know
what
you
want
to
do
because
of
the
distance
from
the
discovery
well

pay
you
a
smaller
royalty
than
youd
get
down
there
but
im
prepared
to
give
you

bonus
on
your
lot
what
kinda
royalty

start
drilling
within
ten
days
thats
somethin
you

thank
you
so
much
for
visiting
with
us
this
evening
ive
traveled
across
half
our
state
to
be
here
and
to
see
about
this
land
some
of
you
might
have
heard
some
of
the
more
extravagant
rumours
about
what
my
plans
are
i
just
thought
youd
like
to
hear
it
from
me
face
to
face

no
great
mystery
im
an
oil
man

ladies
and
gentlemen
i
have
numerous
concerns
right
across
the
state
i
have
may
wells
flowing
at
many
thousands
barrels
per
day
id
like
to
think
of
myself
as
an
oil
man
as
an
oil
man
i
hope
that
you
forgive
just
good
old
fashioned
plain
speaking
this
work
that
we
do

is
very
much
a
family
endeavor
i
work
side
by
side
with
my
wonderful
son
hw

i
think
one
or
two
of
you
might
have
met
him
already
i
encourage
my
men
to
bring
their
families
as
well
it
makes
it
a
so
much
more
rewarding
life
for
them

family
means
children
children
means
education

so
wherever
we
set
up
camp
education
is
a
necessity

were
just
so
happy
to
take
care
of
that
lets
build
a
wonderful
school
in
little
boston
these
children
are
the
future
that
we
strive
for
so
they
should
have
the
very
best
of
things
now
something
else
and
dont
please
be
insulted
if
i
speak
about
this

bread
lets
talk
about
bread
onto
my
mind
its
an
abomination
to
consider
it
to
any
man

woman
or
child
in
this
magnificent
country
of
ours
should
have
to
look
on
a
loaf
of
bread
as
a
luxury
we
can
dig
water
wells
here
water
wells
mean
irrigation

irrigation
means
cultivation
were
gonna
raise
crops
here
were
gonna
have
more
grain
than
we
know
what
to
do
with
new
roads

agriculture

employment
education

these
are
just
a
few
of
the
things
we
can
offer
you
and
i
assure
you
ladies
and
gentlemen
that
if
we
do
find
oil
here
and
i
think
theres
a
good
chance
we
will
this
community
of
yours
will
not
only
survive

it
will
flourish
id
be
happy
to
answer
any
questions
that
you

rested
to
bring
in
this
well

cant
get
that
if

up
here
listening
to
your
gospel

the
well
cant
produce
and
blow
gold
i
wish
i
had
more
time
with
joe
gundha

more
could
have
been
done
and
then
the
well
cant
produce
and
blow
gold
all
over
the
place

you
see
to
it

his
personal
possessions

welcome
to
the
grave
i
will
have
salvation
come
on

come
on

sweeneys
waiting
i
want
you
bleeders
gentlemen

now
dont
be
shy
not
one
man

no

nor
ten
men
and
i
will
get
him
back
even
as
he
gloats
in
the
meantime
ill
practice
on
less
honorable
throats
but
the
work
waits

im
alive
at
last
thats
all
very
well

but
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
him
there

drink
it
down
now

we
got
a
body
molderin
away
upstairs
later
on

when
its
dark

well
take
him
to
some
secret
place
and
bury
him
well

yes

of
course

we
could
do
that
i
dont
suppose
hes
got
any
relatives
going
to
come
poking
around
looking
for
him
seems
a
downright
shame
shame
seems
an
awful
waste
such
a
nice
plump
frame
wotshisname
has
had
has
nor
it
cant
be
traced
business
needs
a
lift
debts
to
be
erased
think
of
it
as
thrift

as
a
gift
if
you
get
my
drift
if
you
get
my
drift
when
you
get
it

if
you
get
it
take

for
instance

mrs

mooney
and
her
pie
shop
take

for
instance

mrs

mooney
and
her
pie
shop
business
never
better

using
only
pussycats
and
toast
and
a
pussys
good
for
maybe
six
or
seven
at
the
most
and
im
sure
they
cant
compare
as
far
as
taste
mrs

lovett

what
a
charming
notion
well

it
does
seem
a
waste
mrs

lovett

how
ive
lived
without
you
all
these
years
ill
never
know
think
about
it
how
delectable
lots
of
other

what

mr

hot
out
of

oven
its

a
little
priest
sir

too
good

at
least
sir

too
good

at
least
then

of
the
flesh

its
pretty
fresh
awful
lot
of
fat

only
where
it
sat
havent
you
got
poet
or
something
like
that
havent
you
got
poet
or
something
like
that
no

you
see
the
trouble
with
poet
is

how
do
you
know
its
deceased
try
the
priest
lawyers
rather
nice
if
its
for
a
price
order
something
else

though

to
follow
anything
that�s
lean
well

then

if
you�re
british
and
loyal

you
might
anyway

its
clean
though

of
course

it
tastes
of
wherever
its
been
is
that
squire
on
the
fire
mercy

closer

notice
its
grocer

thicker

more
like

to
be
grocer

green
the
history
of
the
world

my
love

those
below
serving
those
up
above

only
appropriate
since

my
company
to
your
liking
until
this
moment
i
have
spared
the
rod
and
the
ungrateful
child
has
broken
my
heart
when
you
have
learned
to
appreciate
what
you
have
think
on
your
sins
where
are
you
taking
her
tell
me
or
i
swear
by
god

you

beside

doctor
kripin

give
it
to
me
in
a
nut
shell
well

the
premise
is
quite
simple
take
something
designed
by
nature
and
reprogram
it

to
make
it
work
for
the
body
rather
than
against
it
youre
talking
about
a
virus
indeed

yes
in
this
case
the
measles
virus

which
has
been
engineered
at
genetic
level
to
be
helpful
rather
than
harmful
ill
find
a
best
way
to
describe
it
if
you
can
imagine
your
body
as
a
highway
and
you
picture
the
virus
as
a
very
fast
car
being
driven
by
a
very
bad
man
imagine
the
damage
that
car
could
cause
but
then
if
you
replace
that
man
with
a
cop
the
picture
changes

and
thats
essentially
what
weve
done
how
many
people
have
you
treated
so
far
weve
had
ten
thousand
and
nine
clinical
trials
on
humans
so
far
and
how
many
are
cancer
free
ten
thousand
and
nine
so
you
have
actually
cured
cancer
yes

we
have
three
years
later
what
did
you
see

what
did
you
see

mmmilitary
aircraft

sir

my
hat

yes

sir
get
those
hedgehoppers
in
doolittles
office
after
two
years
of
training
you
believe
that
a

airplane
is
there
for
your
amusement
no

sir

i
was
just
trying
to
keep
my
edge

major
and
when
you
did
the
outside
loop
last
week
what
did
you
think
that
was
honing
your
skills
thats
not
training

mccawley
thats
a
stunt
and
i
personally
consider
it
to
be
reckless
and
irresponsible
major
how
could
that
be

when
youre
famous
for
being
the
first
man
in
the
world
ever
to
do
it
dont
get
cute
with
me

son
no

sir

i
dont
mean
to
be
disrespectful
i
just
think
that
well

i
it
is
reckless
and
irresponsible
if
youre
just
doing
it
to
be
a
showoff
but
i
was
doing
it
to
try
to
inspire
the
men

sir
in
the
way
that
youve
inspired
me
i
believe
the
french
even
have
a
word
for
that
when
the
men
get
together
to
honor
their
leaders
they
call
it
an
homage

sir
a
what
an
homage

sir
thats
bullshit

mccawley
but
its
very

very
good
bullshit
thank
you

sir
mccawley

you
remind
me
of
myself
fifteen
years
ago
which
is
why
we
need
to
discuss
this
have
a
seat

son
the
british
have
accepted
you
into
the
eagle
squadron
youre
on
your
way
to
england

if
you
still
want
to
go
just
a
few
british
pilots

all
that
stand
between
hitler

total
victory
in
europe
theyre
gonna
need
all
the
help
they
can
get
yes

kind
of
shy
around
the
girls
a
little
unsure
of
himself

you
know
his
old
man
used
to
run
him
down
a
lot
get
him
in
a
plane

hes
sure
of
himself
hes
like
my
brother

hes
like
my
best
friend
hes
my
right
hand
which
at
the
moment
is
a
long
way
south
of
my
waist
yeah

i
guess
you
did
you
and
me

we
got
to
talk
so

the
rumor
is
the
navys
shipping

pearl
harbor
well

be
so
bad
its
about
as
far
from
the
fighting
as
you

theyre

as
i

what
they
really
need
are
tanks

bullets

bombs

men
to
fight
but
our
people
think
hitler
and
his
nazi
thugs

europes
problem

to
do
more
send
the
brits

of

evelyn

i
was
just
down
at
the
beach
this
morning
and
i
watched
the
sun
rise
and
i
knew
that
everything
was
gonna
be
different
in
this
place

in
this
moment
and
i
dont
care
what
anybody
else
says

you
know
how
can
i
not
feel
this
way
i
kinda
like
you

gonna
be
all
right

ok
do
you
have
any
airtours
going
through
the
valley
of
oahu
you
do
aloha

this
is
kgmb
in
honolulu
on
another
beautiful
fall
day
here
in
paradise
we
have
enough
information
we
are
returning
home
do
you
ever
wonder
if
this
wars
gonna
catch
up
with
us
every
moment
were
not
together

youre
up
there
training
for
it
yeah

well

im
training
for
moments
like
these
cause
i
have
no
idea
cause
i
have
no
idea
evelyn

can
you
please
come
out
of
the
bathroom
youve
been
there
for
an
hour
evelyn
what
are
you
trying
to
do

look
like
me
whats
the
matter
no

you
they
call
it
the
vacant
sea
none
of
the
major
sea
lanes
go
through
it
and
you
can
bury
the
entire
land
mass
of
asia
there
and
nobody
would
know
from
there

they
could
attack
anywhere
our
last
signals
intercept
indicate
that
the
japanese
taskforce
is
heading
south
towards
the
philippines
or
southeast
asia
but
captain
thurman
of
naval
intelligence
here
has
his
own
theory
about
the
missing
ships
sir

i
believe
theyll
try
to
hit
us
where
itll
hurt
us
the
most
pearl
harbor
its
over

nautical
miles
from
japan
to
pearl
thats
a
long
distance
to
steam
a
navy

captain
your
theory
is
based
on
what
thats
not
exactly
hard
evidence

captain
thurman
wed
already
be
at
war
sir

we
can
read
their
diplomatic
codes
sir

we
can
read
their
diplomatic
codes
faster
than
they
can
type
them
but
captain
thurmans
cryptology
team
is
still
trying
to
crack
the
naval
codes
the
intercepts
have
missing
words
and
garbled
lines
so
to
explain
the
decrypts

we
have
to
try
to
interpret
what
we
think
theyre
trying
to
do
interpret
you
mean
guess
they
use
their
informed
intuition

sir
its
like
playing
chess
in
the
dark
any
rumor

troop
movement

ship
movement
spinetingle

goose
bump

we
pay
attention
to
it
the
locals
used
to
try
to
get
outside
of
a
problem
the
locals
used
to
try
to
get
outside
of
a
problem
to
try
to
see
the
inside
well

i
see
a
strike
on
pearl
its
the
worst
thing
that
could
happen
the
pacific
fleets
ability
to
make
war
the
pacific
fleets
ability
to
make
war
so

sir

you
would
have
us
mobilize
the
entire
fleet
at
the
cost
of
millions
of
dollars
based
on
this
spinetingling
feeling
of
yours
no

sir

my
job
is
to
gather
and
interpret
material
based
on
incomplete
information
from
my
limited
decoding
ability
is
your
job

sir
then
break
the
damn
naval
code

captain
so
i
can
make
a
better
decision
aye

sir

we
are
trying
i
wonder
if
we
shouldnt
put
the
pacific
fleet
on
full
alert
in
case
the
optimism
of
the
honolulu
advertiser
proves
unfounded

gentlemen
going
to
do
about
protecting
my
ships
within
a
tenmile
radius
of
your
harbor
we
have
fighterplanes
here
at
wheeler
bombers
at
hickam

and
a
trainingstrip
at
haleiwa
weve
recently
established
a
radar
station
here
that
can
detect
planes

miles
out
which
is
a
month
old

admiral

and
untested
ive
seen
these
new
radar
screens

major
theres
no
way
of
telling
whether
theyre
ours

theirs
im
intercepting
a
call
from
tokyo
to
somewhere
close
by
pearl
theres
a
call
from
tokyo
they
say
they
dont
know
you
he
can
see
pearl
harbor
from
his
office
he
can
see
pearl
harbor
from
his
office
are
there
many
sailors
around
uh

the
dentist
says
that
the
flatships
are
not
in
port
theyre
talking
about
the
weather
he
doesnt
seem
to
know
who
hes
talking
to
admiral

may
i
speak
to
you
in
private
why
would
a
spy
use
a
phone
they
know
we
tap
all
international
lines
our
listeners
feel
its
probably
not
code
talk
it
sounds
like
someone
in
japan
is
sneaking
around
asking
a
local
citizen
the
location
of
our
carriers
well

that
makes
me
feel
all
warm
inside
get
the
fbi
on
it
immediately
have
we
found
the
goddamn
japanese
fleet
yet
no

admiral

the
bases
are
looking
all
over
the
pacific
so
the
entire
fleet
could
be
rounding
diamond
head
and
we
wouldnt
know
a
thing
about
it
get
on
it
im
alive

the
base
bought
this
field
from
the
city
two
months
ago
city
property
only
extends

feet
from
the
center
line
of
the
road
so
i
dont
think
its
our
body

chief
well

hallelujah
lets
go
home
wrap
it
up

fellas
boys
with
the
shiny
buttons
are
coming
in
it
will
necessarily
break
the
back
of
the
insurgency
it
is
not

though

the
panacea
just
by
taking
it
out
does
not
mean
the
rest
of
the
insurgency
will
fall
more
than
half
of
fallujahs

residents
have
already
fled
in
anticipation
of
the
offensive
insurgents
believed
to
number
in
the
thousands
have
been
preparing
defenses
attacking
us

troops

and
rigging
booby
traps
mr

deerfield
jim
osher

could
i
get
a
word
yeah

come
on
in

ill
just
be
a
minute
sir

i
regret
to
inform
you
that
a
body
was
found
last
night
upon
investigation

we
believe
it
to
be
the
remains
of
your
son

michael
deerfield
right

theyll
need
me
to
identify
the
body
no

sir

weve
theyve
determined
identity
in
other
ways

i
believe
partial
fingerprints
what
do
you
mean
partial
what
happened
to
him
im
not
at
liberty
to
say

sir

someone
i
wanna
see
his
body
now
sergeant
deerfield

this
isnt
necessary
its
not
how
you
wanna
remember
your
son
maybe
not
but
its
the
way
he
left
this
earth

so
i
dont
see
as
i
have
any
choice
working
backwards

carbon
patterns
show
the
body
was
dismembered
before
it
was
burned
it
appears
a
large
knife
or
tool
was
used

but
the
blade
was
dull
which
is
why
the
bones
are
shattered
rather
than
severed
burn
patterns
show
us
the
dismembered
parts
were
stacked
and
doused
with
an
accelerant
in
an
attempt
to
incinerate
the
body
youd
need
an
oven
to
approach
an
effective
temperature
which
means
most
tissue
wouldve
been
left
intact
so
the
damage
is
largely
the
result
of
scavengers
stripping
the
bones
cause
of
death
will
take
more
time
to
determine
but
there
is
evidence
of
stab
wounds
how
many
how
many
stab
wounds
well

with
much
of
the
flesh
missing
we
can
only
count
blows
that
made
impact
with
bone
how
many
of
those
were
there
fortytwo
one
knife

or
several
one
gonna
turn
these
over
to
the
army
tried
to
said
they
took
their
own
photos

and
they
didnt
say
it
in
a
nice
way
id
like
to
give
you
a
call
tomorrow
before
you
go
home
i
have
a
few
questions
ask
them
now
your
son
didnt
own
a
green
car
mike
doesnt
own
a
car
motorist
reported
seeing
a
green
sedan
parked
on
the
shoulder
near
the
field
that
saturday
night
one
of
the
theories
is
that
this
is
a
carjacking
or
a
robbery
gone
wrong
and
theres
a
big
uptick
in
gang
activity
lately
i
wanna
see
where
he
died
im
sorry

its
an
active
crime
scene

but
i
will
let
you
know
as
soon
as
you
can
okay
what
else
you
wanna
ask
a
lot
of
the
deaths
like
these
have
been
drugrelated
are
you
asking
if
mike
was
a
drug
dealer
or
just
an
addict
i
dont
wanna
be
asking
anything
you
know
the
army
does
regular
drug
tests
not
when
theyre
in
iraq
now

we
found
this
under
your
sons
mattress
its
not
gonna
go
in
my
report
but
why
i
ask
is
last
month
we
arrested
three
soldiers
who
were
trying
to
smuggle
heroin
in
from
kuwait
theyd
made
arrangements
to
sell
it
to
a
local
mexican
gang
i
understand
mike
spoke
a
little
spanish
and
you
think
he
couldve
been
a
drug
mule
because
he
spoke
spanish
because
somebody
cut
off
his
hands
and
his
head
im
really
sorry
about
your
son
show
me
i
need
to
see
where
he
died
its
not
our
case
the
murder
occurred
on
military
property
you
know
where
it
is
theres
nothing
to
see
then
there
shouldnt
be
any
problem
with
me
seeing
it
you
people
sure
as
hell
know
how
to
trample
a
crime
scene

ill
give
you
that
i
suppose
you
thought
it
was
a
good
idea
to
have
everybody
you
ever
met
park
on
this
shoulder
if
your
boys
knew
what
they
were
doing
theyd
have
found
traces
of
blood
in
the
gravel
right
here
its
where
he
was
killed
so
you
dont
see
blood

but
you
know
its
there
just
like
i
know
his
body
was
dragged
from
here
to
there
thats
remarkable
the
ground
is
rockhard

but
you
see
drag
marks
you
go
to
the
trouble
to
burn
a
body

dont
you
think
youd
cover
your
tracks
im
going
to
the
restroom
you
might
find
it
easier
to
drive
around
that
field
you
couldnt
do
any
more
damage
everybody
knows
everything
can
i
help
you
i
suppose
the
mps
have
been
in
here
asking
questions
about
what
happened
in
that
field
they
sure
have

terrible
thing

im
checking
it
out
for
the
family
mind
if
i
ask
if
you
saw
anything
i
wish
we
had

we
wouldve
liked
to
help
we
didnt
know
what
it
was
when
we
smelled
it

did
we
no

hows
that
that
sunday

when
we
drove
in
the
parking
lot
we
just
thought
somebody
had
been
barbecuing
smelled
like
burned
meat
tell
your
mp
friends
they
should
be
looking
for
a
blue
car

not
a
green
one
because
a
blue
car
under
a
yellow
light
looks
green
it
certainly
does
its
the
least
i
could
do
id
say
thats
accurate
ill
get
a
plane
ticket
what
do
you
mean

no
ill
bring
him
home

as
i
can
i
need

the
one

no

you
saying
itd
be
good
for
his
character

who
won
that
argument

hank
mike
was
the
one
who
wanted
to
join

i
sure
as
hell
didnt
encourage
it
living
in
this
house

he
never
couldve
felt
like
a
man
if
he
hadnt
gone
both
of
my
boys

hank

be
taken

an
insult
this
your

maam
im
asking
if

it
wouldve
been
a
week
ago
saturday
im
sorry

i
dont
recognize
anything
but
the
uniform
thank
you

maam

miss
excuse
me

lieutenant
i
was
just
wondering
how
i
came
to
be
assigned
this
case
which
case
jacob
ronald
millard
slaughterhouse
employee

arrested
for
torturing
chickens
its
no
big
deal

everybody
does
it
everybody
doesnt
poke
their
eyes
out

asshole
sure

they
do

shut
up
boss
doesnt
want
me
humping
his
daughter
now
were
shocked
beyond
words
you
see
how
you
could
draw
information
out
of
people
people
just
like
you

emily
that
is
how
you
got
promoted
from
traffic
to
detective
squad

am
i
right
oh

dont
be
if
wayne
or
hodge
couldve
fucked
their
way
into
the
squad

they
wouldve
too
well

wayne
would
have
one
of
us
needs
to
know
what
were
doing
you
see

thats
what
concerns
me

having
fucked
my
way
into
the
job
i
may
not
be
qualified
enough
to
piece
together
this
complex
of
a
crime
i
mean

take
that
murder
site
i
wouldve
never
concluded
that
that
soldier
was
killed
on
army
property
i
wouldve
been
fooled
by
the
signs
of
struggle
on
the
side
of
the
road
and
you
know
that
little
trail
of
broken
brush
from
there
to
where
he
was
burned
well

that
wouldve
made
me
think
he
was
killed
in
our
jurisdiction

and
then
moved
because
the
killers
didnt
think
it
smart
to
chop
him
up
under
a
bright
streetlight
yeah

i
wouldve
totally
misread
that
crime
scene
no

no

no

its
good
work
i
mean

we
needed
another
homicide
what

weve
solved
three
out
of
the
last
another
unsolved
would
cement
my
standing
with
the
mayor
you
have
a
problem
with
your
fellow
detectives
you
feel
the
need
to
show
them
up
no

sir
so
its
the
military
police
you
think
theyre
boobs

theyll
bungle
the
investigation
no

but
lets
not
pretend
we
dont
know
the
real
motives
for
the
army
wanting
this
case
psychic
powers

when
did
you
discover
you
had
these
you
dont
believe
their
primary
concern
will
be
how
this
incident
reflects
on
the
army
this
is
a
career
move
is
that
it
i
dont
have
a
career

sir

i
have
a
job
i
take
care
of
my
son
and
do
what
im
told
this
boy
died
in
a
ditch
beside
one
of
our
streets
someone
burned
him
like
a
cord
of
wood

leaving
his
remains
for
animals
to
chew
on
with
respect

if
that
was
your
son
just
back
from
iraq
i
dont
think
youd
be
as
happy
about
tossing
this
case
off
so
you
look
better
come
election
time
that
was
with
respect
that
was
my
intent

sir
fine

ill
think
about
it
and
ill
let
you
know
every
second
we
lose
in
this
didnt
you
say
that
you
would
do
whatever
you
were
told
i
sometimes
exaggerate
for
effect
hows
david
hes
fine

thanks
for
asking
that
deadbeat
ex
of
yours
ever
show
up
for
any
of
his
games
davids
pretty
pathetic
at
every
sport
he
attempts
so
he
wants
as
few
people
to
witness
it
as
possible
well

thats
a
damn
shame

isnt
it
its
not
like
hes
the
boys
father
its
the
oddballs
and
the
misfits
who
go
on
to
do
interesting
things
with
their
lives
how
many
former
high
school
quarterbacks
do
we
roll
into
the
drunk
tank
every
saturday
night
little
misery
in
school

a
good
thing

bring
you
some
comfort
anybody

you
took
this

sir

i
asked
the
visitors
center
where
you
were

coffee
i
really
should
get

about
a
drink
to
mike
i
need
to
ask
you
something

and
i
want
the
truth
was
mike
doing
drugs
doc
i
guess
no
more
than
the
other
guys

he
wasnt
like
a
heavy
doper
or
anything
you
ever
see
him
hanging
out
off
the
base
with
anyone
maybe
mexicans
how
you
adjusting
being
back
hasnt
been
that
long
call
your
parents
my
mom

my
dad
and
i
arent
close
did
you
guys
talk
much
sure
we
couldve
talked
more
did
he
ever
say
anything
to
you
that
i
should
know
you
see
shit
over
there
you
dont
wanna
talk
about
even
with
your
buddies

yeah
but
he
did
all
right

mike
he
was
a
firstclass
soldier
you
know
mike

he
loved
the
army
couldnt
wait
to
get
there

save
the
good
guys
and
hurt
the
bad
guys
they
shouldnt
send
heroes
to
places
like
iraq
everything
theres
fucked
up
before
i
went

id
never
say
this

but
you
ask
me
now
they
should
just
nuke
it
and
watch
it
all
turn
back
to
dust
yeah

i
was
just
about
to
call
you
a
package
came
from
michael
what
kind
of
package
i
dont
know

its
a
package

he
sent
it
to
himself

its
from
overseas
im
gonna
open
it
what
do
you
mean

no
does
it
look
like
its
been
opened
by
customs
or
by
the
military
how
would
i
know
no

it
doesnt
why
cant
i
open
it
just
dont
just
put
it
someplace
safe
i
wonder
if
i
could
ask
you
a
few
questions
about
your
son
i
thought
it
wasnt
your
case

it
sort
of
fell
back
to
me
isnt
that
our
good
fortune
i
was
wondering
if
you
knew
if
your
son
had
any
enemies
you
mean
other
than
the
thousands
of
iraqis
and
foreign
fighters
trying
to
kill
him
till
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
yeah

that
shirt
looks
like
its
still
wet
its
dry
enough
anything
bothering
him
that
you
know
about
you
looking
into
the
gang
connection
why
you
have
reason
to
think
your
son
was
involved
in
gangs
or
drugs
when
did
you
last
speak
to
him
why
capital
one
faxed
me
a
recent
summary
of
his
creditcard
charges
after
he
got
back

he
bought
tube
socks
i
told
him
a
dozen
times

those
are
the
worst
socks
they
have
no
heel

they
wear
right
through
and
then
he
went
out
for
some
chicken
does
it
say
what
time
and
no
more
charges
we
assume
your
son
was
killed
sometime
saturday
night
or
sunday
morning
we
havent
found
his
wallet

but
if
it
was
stolen
wed
see
a
lot
more
charges
on
it

like
computers

stereos

what
have
you
have
you
been
to
the
chicken
place

the
army

they
said
theyd
consider
my
request
and
that
was

minutes
ago
and
id
like
to
talk
to
these
men
before
theyve
been
coached
or
debriefed
so
any
inconsistencies
in
their
stories
will
have
disappeared
being
a
former
military
man

im
sure

seen
that
perhaps
when
you
served
with
lieutenant
kirklander
ill
tell
you
what
skip
upstairs
and
cry
to
your
boyfriend
because
im
just
not

just
come
in
to
cnn
from
fallujah
you
ordered
yet
okay

dig
in

men
may
i
please
okay

out

no

i
can
do
it
you
can

now
get
ready
for
bed

go
on
is
there
anything
i
can
do
youre
supposed
to
read
it
to
me
i
dont
understand
one
word
of
it
well

do
you
know
any
stories
im
not
much
of
a
storyteller
well

then
read
me
the
book
you
know
where
your
name
comes
from
my
mother
no

before
that
youre
named
after
king
david

your
mother
didnt
tell
you
that
there
were
two
great
armies
assembled

the
israelites
and
the
philistines
they
were
both
up
on
hills

the
valley
of
elah
in
between
its
in
palestine

you
know
where
it
is
no

doesnt
matter
anyway

the
philistines
had
a
champion
a
huge
giant
named
goliath
really
theres
a
robot
named
goliath
this
is
a
different
guy
so
every
day

for

days
goliath
would
stride
down
into
the
valley
and
challenge
somebody
from
the
other
side
to
fight

but
nobody
would
all
the
bravest
and
strongest
warriors
that
the
king
had
were
all
too
scared
why
didnt
they
just
shoot
him
they
didnt
have
guns
they
had
arrows

but
there
are
rules
to
combat
you
dont
shoot
somebody
thats
challenging
you
to
fight
with
a
sword
one
day
this
kid

not
much
bigger
than
you

comes
delivering
bread
he
says
to
the
king

ill
fight
goliath
really
no
way

true
story
so
the
king
dresses
david
in
his
own
armor
but
its
much
too
big
and
heavy

so
david
takes
it
off
and
he
looks
around
and
he
finds
five
smooth
stones
about
that
big
and
he
steps
out
into
the
valley

with
his
slingshot
in
his
hand
goliath
comes
running
yelling
this
horrible
scream
and
david
lets
fly
with
that
slingshot
hits
him
in
the
forehead

cracks
his
skull
open
goliath
falls
down

dead
so
he
shot
him
with
a
rock

not
the
same
thing
and
you
want
to
know
how
he
beat
him
how
the
first
thing
david
had
to
fight
was
his
own
fear
he
beat
that

he
beat
goliath
because
when
goliath
came
running

david
planted
his
feet

took
aim
and
waited
you
know
how
much
courage
that
took
just
a
few
more
steps
and
goliath
wouldve
crushed
him
then
he
let
fly
with
that
rock
thats
how
you
fight
monsters
you
lure
them
in
close
to
you

you
look
them
in
the
eye
you
smack
them
down
you
fight
a
lot
of
monsters
you
win
if
i
didnt

id
have
been
crushed

right
he
likes
to
sleep
with
that
door
open
door
not
that
much

okay
you
know
that
story
isnt
true
of
course
its
true
its
even
in
the
koran
may
i
read
the
mens
statements
there
is
nothing
in
them
thatll
help
the
last
time
any
of
the

in
a
moment
evie

from
the
bar
i
saw
the
picture
of
your
son
in
the
paper
when
you
came
in

i
thought
he
was
just
missing
nice
eyes

i
remember
i
work
in
another
bar
on
the
weekends

he
was
there
mustve
been
saturday
night
whats
the
name
of
that
bar
yeah

they
were
here

both
of
them
yeah

them
and
their
buddies

saturday
night
we
had
to
throw
them
out

that
one
was
harassing
one
of
the
dancers

real
asshole
this
guy
other
one

a
lot
of
assholes
in
here

but
he
was
going
for
the
prize
shouting
obscenities
at
the
dancers

the
wrong
man

if
i
know
they
werent
happy
about

two
of

into
it
out
in
the
parking
lot

out
your
statement
i
want

nugent
word
this
is
not
saigon

this
is
not


you
do
not
question
witnesses
i
figured
somebody
should
it
must
be
frustrating
being
such
a
damn
good
investigator
surrounded
by
incompetent
fools

remind
me

what
is
it
you
do
in
munro
i
haul
gravel
thats
a
shame
think
of
all
the
crime
that
couldve
been
solved
if
youd
been
on
the
job
this
goes
to
trial

the
defense
will
say
you
poisoned
the
well
it
wont
go
to
trial

what
it
wasnt
them

im
sorry
i
dont
know
why
they
lied
about
not
being
with
him

but
they
didnt
do
it
they
were
fighting
in
the
parking
lot

blowing
off
steam
you
have
not
been
to
war
so
you
wont
understand
this
you
do
not
fight
beside
a
man
and
then
do
that
to
him
thats
quite
the
world
you
live
in
find
out
why
they
lied
therell
be
a
reason
so
you
were
there
so
why
would
you
lie
its
complicated
why
dont
you
just
tell
me
what
happened
we
were
at
this
strip
club
just
hanging
out

having
a
good
time

we
were
drinking

of
course
and
mike
starts
acting
really
weird
really
angry

throwing
change
at
the
stripper
then
he
started
talking
trash
so
she
started
talking
trash

and
they
tossed
us
out
and
were
getting
in
the
car
and
bonners
all
pissed
saying
mike
can
walk
so
mike
grabs
him
and
they
just
start
going
off
on
each
other
but
its
the
kind
of
shit
that
happens
all
the
time
the
whole
machowarrior
crap
nobody
got
hurt
so
we
got
in
the
car

we
drove
around
for
a
while
and
then
we
stopped
at
the
chicken
shack

across
from
the
base
mike
bought

for
getting
us
kicked
out
and
what
time
was
this
i
dont
know
around
and
then
we
came
back
here
all
of
you
just
the
three
of
us
why
would
you
leave
him
there
because
we
were
wasted
we
had
had
enough

but
mike
wanted
to
find
some
meth
he
wanted
to
buy
drugs
yeah

like
he
needed
to
be
more
fucked
up
pardon
my
language

maam
you
think
thats
what
happened
he
went
looking
for
drugs

ran
into
the
wrong
people
who
knows
i
mean

mike
always
had
secrets
you
know

over
there

he
was
always
sneaking
off
by
himself
he
really
didnt
get
along
too
well
with
people
so
you
get
kicked
out
of
the
strip
club
at


show
up
at
the
chicken
shack
at
what
were
you
doing
for
a
whole
two
hours
driving
around

looking
for
a
party

or
women
did
you
stop
anywhere
now
you
want
me
to
guess
we
found
a
hooker
over
on
ten
mile
road
she
blew
all
four
of
us
why
didnt
you
say
that
when
you
were
questioned
we
didnt
think
mike
wanted
his
parents
to
know
you
didnt
want
his
father
to
know
he
got
a
blow
job
and
was
buying
drugs

i
wouldnt
want
somebody
telling
my
parents
so

what
was
the
fight
about
mike
was
in
some
dark
mood

i
dont
know
why
and
then
he
started
saying
nasty
things
to
that
stripper
like
what
stuff
im
not
gonna
repeat

the
womans
a
stripper

not
something

your
shoe

parking
lot

was
different
about
that
night

commanders
office
let
me
speak
to
captain
henning

please

one
moment

sir
we
were
leaving
the
strip
club
and
we
thought
that
mike
and
bonner
have
cooled
down
they
could
be
like
that

laughing
one
minute
and
fighting
the
next
anyway

were
in
the
car

and
mikes
all
pissy
and
bonner
just
starts
needling
him
just
saying
shit
i
dont
know

like
what
a
good
driver
mike
is
stuff
that
makes
no
sense
but
bonner
has
enough

and
he
pulls
over
and
they
just
start
going
off
on
each
other
and
long
was
yelling
for
them
to
cut
it
out
so
we
can
go
home
and
mike
starts
cussing
at
him
too
and
then
i
look
down

and
im
stabbing
him
you
you
are
and
your
friends
didnt
try
and
stop
you
i
think
they
were
sort
of
stunned
theyre
yelling
and
mike
falls
to
the
ground

and
hes
dead
and
long

screaming

christ

what
do
we
do
now
it
was
bonners
idea
to
chop
him
up
he
used
to
work
for
a
butcher
he
knew
how
to
work
the
knife
around
the
joints

made
it
easier
we
wouldve
buried
the
parts
but
it
was
getting
late
and
we
hadnt
eaten
you
were
hungry
starving
we
stopped
at
the
chicken
shack
i
liked
mike

all
did
but
i
think
on
another
night
that
wouldve
been
mike
with
the
knife
and
me
in
the
field
i
think
he
was
the
smart
one
i
think
he
could
see
im
truly
sorry

sir
im
sorry
for
your
loss
i
saw
a
video
mike
shot
him
in
the
back
of
a
humvee
looked
like
he
was
torturing
a
prisoner
or
we
arrested
some
haji
who
was
wounded
and
we
were
riding
along
and
mike
was
pretending
like
he
was
a
medic
and
he
would
stick
his
hand
in
this
guys
wound
and
he
says

does
this
hurt
and
the
haji
screamed

yeah

yeah
and
then
mike
would
stick
his
hand
in
the
exact
same
place
it
was
pretty
funny
it
became
a
thing
with
mike

your

an
oil
rigger

was
kind
of
austere
chriss
dad
was
a
bit
of
a
religious
fanatic
after
he
lost
both
his
legs

he
found
jesus
after
he
lost
both
his
legs

he
found
jesus
god

sorry

but
itjust
doesnt
seem
like
a
fair
trade
what
were
you
saying
about
hedley
papas
invited
us
for
some
shooting

oh

really
id
better
bring
a
different
change
of
clothes
i
dont
think
your
mother
appreciated
what
i
brought
last
time
i
think
that
was
your
swimsuit

shes
used
to
slightly
more
fabric
im
sure
if
she
knew
youd
worn
it
in
a
movie

shed
suddenly
find
it
chic
true

have
you
done
many
movies
it
was
a
commercial

not
a
movie
but
your
eyes
went
straight
to
her

if
you
know
what
i
mean
i
dont
think
my
career
has
really
gone
as
planned
oh

you
just
need
a
break
i
think
its
important
to
be
lucky
in
anything
well

i
dont
believe
in
luck

i
believe
in
hard
work
oh

hard
work
is
mandatory
but
i
think
everybodys
afraid
to
admit
what
a
big
part
luck
plays
i
mean

it
seems
scientists
are
confirming
more
and
more
that
all
existence
is
here
by
blind
chance
no
purpose

no
design
well

i
dont
care

i
love
every
minute
of
it
and
i
envy
you
for
it
what
was
it
the
the
vicar
used
to
say
despair
is
the
path
of
least
resistance
it
was
something
odd

wasnt
it
it
was
very
strange
i
think
that
faith
is
the
path
of
least
resistance
oh

god

oh

god
can
we
change
the
subject

please
nola
was
talking
about
acting

which
is
much
more
interesting

tried
yoga
hello

hi

oh

hey
how
was
it
blew
that
itjust
works

you

at
home

but
i
dont
know

i
just
can
never
really
pull
through
in
the
end

you
will

you
will
i
could
actually
use
a
drink
just
to
pull
myself
together
a
little
bit

sure
ok

this
way
what
was
i
saying
my
sister
went
to
college
for
a
couple
of
years
but
im
like
you

im
selftaught
you
should
see
my
sister

shes
shes
very
beautiful

but
shes
lost
in
drugs
and
im
sure
shes
not
more
beautiful
than
you
are
what
i
am
is
sexy

but
lindas
is
classically
beautiful
so

you
are
aware
of
your
effect
on
men
before
my
parents
split

they
used
to
put
her
in
these
pageants
its
just
a
joke
what
did
your
father
do
he
left
and
never
sent
any
money
and
my
mother
could
never
hold
down
a
job
her
problem
was
that
she
drank
how
did
you
meet
tom
we
met
at
a
party
saw
me
across
the
room
and
he
honed
in
on
me

like
a
guided
missile
i
liked
him
right
off

you
know
well

i
think
hes
very
handsome
dont
you
and
he
asked
you
to
marry
him
swept
me
off
of
my
feet
with
presents
and

you
know
what
did
i
know
about
that
kind
of
life
im
just
a
starving
actress
from
boulder

colorado
i
had
another
bad
marriage
behind
me

thats
another
reason
she
hates
me
who
eleanor

toms
mother
she
wants
him
to
marry
this
girl
named
olivia
who
i
think
is
a
distant
cousin

i
dont
know

its
its
sick
its
such
an
inbred
family

its
and
was
it
love
at
first
sight
for
you
too
i
thought
he
was
very
handsome
you
know

and
i
told
you
i
was
just
i
was
overwhelmed
with
attention
so

what
about
you
and
chloe
shes
very
sweet
she
is
very
sweet
and
she
wants
to
marry
you
i
dont
think
her
mother
would
approve
of
that
either
no

no

its
different
i
dont
buy
into
eleanor

and
she
knows
it

but
you
are
being
groomed
you
mark
my
words
they
almost
died
when
they
thought
that
chloe
had
run
off
with
some
guy
that
ran
a
gastropub
in
the
city
youre
gonna
do
very
well
for
yourself

unless
you
blow
it
and
how
am
i
going
to
blow
it
by
making
a
pass
at
me
and
what
makes
you
think
thats
gonna
happen
men
always
seem
to
wonder
they
think
id
be
something
very
special
well

no
ones
ever
asked
for
their
money
back
where
was
all
this
confidence
when
you
needed
it
in
the
audition
ive
had
too
much
to
drink
can
you
get
me
a
cab
you
were
driving
a
bit
fast
werent
you
good
morning
which
one
is
he
in
second
one
over
there
so

do
you
think
hes
gonna
be
all
right
so

do
you
think
hes
gonna
be
all
right
carmichael
came
and
had
a
look
at
him
the
other
week
oh

hes
so
sweet
the
problem
with
the
right
hind
is
gonna
it
should
have
dissipated
fully
already
tom

can
i
feed
him
yeah

yeah

wack
him
some
hay
tom

do
you
think
hes
gonna
be
able
to
play
on
sunday
well

he
will
play
on
sunday

but
its
just
the
problem
with
the
fact
that
its
only
lopez
who
can
ride
him

and
hes
injured
at
the
moment
were
having
a
bloody
nightmare
with
injuries
what
would
you
say
to
the
idea
of
taking
a
business
course
at
school
that
the
company
would
pay
for
ive
had
very
good
feedback
on
your
work
and
the
beginning
of
next
year
theres
going
to
be
a
very
significant
position
opening
up
one
that
carries
a
great
deal
of
responsibility
and
pays
accordingly
plus

there
are
a
number
of
perks
expense
account

driver

et
cetera
we
had
been
focusing
on
someone
else
but
its
obvious
to
me
that
you
and
chloe
have
become
close
although
i
wouldnt
consider
it

if
i
didnt
think
you
were
qualified
id
hate
to
disappoint
you
oh

excuse
me

come
on

chris
were
nearly
ready
ill
bring
a
gun
for
chris

thanks

tom
this
is
basically
a
tuneup
for
the
grouse
season

which
is
starting
soon
but
its
bloody
good
fun

dont
frighten
him
his
shootings
not
really
up
to
his
tennis

poor
thing
ill
make
an
accomplished
grouse
shooter
of
him
yet
dont
you
worry

chris

quite
right

papa
come
on

chloe
have
you
seen
my
strindberg
book
how
did
your
audition
go
oh

it
was
pretty
awful

im
afraid
its
her
own
fault

bless
her

she
just
tightens
up
well

im
sure
something
worthwhile
will
come
along
unfortunately

theres
just
not
anything
right
now
that
im
that
great
for
so

how
long
do
you
keep
it
up
well

if
time
passes
and
nothing
significant
materializes
how
long
do
you
keep
on
going
before
you
decide
that
to
try
something
else
i
hardly
think
nolas
reached
that
point

mother
all
im
saying
is
you
give
acting
a
try
for
a
time
all
im
saying
is
you
give
acting
a
try
for
a
time
and
if
you
keep
being
disappointed
you
have
to
ask
yourself
the
question
is
this
really
what
i
want
in
my
life
is
this
what
i
want
well

i
do
ask
myself
that
see
its
only
logical

tom
especially
for
a
woman
its
a
particularly
cruel
business
for
a
woman
and
as
you
get
older
and
time
passes
if
nothing
happens
it
gets
harder
and
harder
eleanor

nola
isnt
exactly
over
the
hill
im
not
saying
now
but
im
a
great
one
for
facing
up
to
realities
your
take
on
these
realities
is
your
own
opinion
and
nothing
else
frankly

not
everybody
else
is
interested
in
hearing
about
it
tom

dont
raise
your
voice
to
your
mother

please
im
not
raising
my
voice

and
im
sorry

papa
but
shes
always
on
nolas
case

continually
discouraging
her
via
innuendos
all
im
saying
is
actings
so
willothewisp
those
that
have
it

know
it
right
off
to
pursue
it
because
you
dont
want
to
admit
defeat
to
friends
back
home
is

frankly

unrealistic
im
sorry

but
thats
the
way
i
feel
its
ok

id
like
to
be
alone

thanks
its
ok

id
like
to
be
alone

thanks
well

thank
you
very
much

and
im
sorry
if
im
raising
my
voice
now
but
you
know
thats
her
achilles
heel

emotionally
hes
right

eleanor

i
think
youve
had
one
too
many
g
and
ts
i
was
looking
for
you
i
was
upset

i
just
wanted
to
be
alone
i
dont
mean
to
intrude
i
need
a
drink
i
like
you
when
you
drink

you
get
flirtatious
do
i
yeah
confident

i
dont
think
this
was
a
good
idea
you
shouldnt
have
followed
me
here
do
you
feel
guilty
we
cant
do
this
this
cant
lead
anyplace
darling

i
think
its
for
you
but
take
it
outside
well

theres
hope

at
least
whens
the
callback
just
let
me
know
when
you
hear
anything
at
all
cause
i
really
think
i
could
be
great

this
part

you
been
so
cold
to
me
i
havent
been
cold

distant

evasive

dont
want
to
encourage

happened

chris
i
mean
the
moment
was
very
out
of
control
for
many
reasons
i
was
upset

i
was
drinking

and
the
storm
was
overpowering
oh

stop
rationalizing

not
rationalizing
passions

very
involved

other
people

charming
flat
the

rundown
as
you

i
was
lucky
to
find
it
on
such
short
notice
i
mean

its
not
perfect
the
buildings
been
burglarized
a
couple
of
times
and
the
woman
down
the
hall
has
mice

but
you

the
lobbys
decent
the
key
word
is
its
cheap
its
so
hard
to
leave
you
beautiful
woman
god

did
you
see
that
stuff
on
the
news
last
night
about
that
earthquake
in
china
and
there
was
this
whole
thing
about
how
theyve
discovered
an
entirely
new
planet

yeah
i
went
looking
for
space
to
rent
for
the
new
gallery
yesterday
papas
getting
so
into
the
idea
it
should
be
good
for
you
ive
got
to
go
to
work

oh

really
i
was
kind
of
hoping
we
might

you
know
before
you
went
to
work
its
my
time
of
the
month

and
remember
the
doctor
said
we
really
should
try
and
do
it
as
often
as
we
possibly
can
in
the
morning
darling

im
gonna
be
late

come
on

itll
be
fun
wait

ive
got
to
take
my
temperature
first
so

you
wanna
meet
the
same
time
next
week
let
me
come
up
we
just
spent
an
hour
at
the
hotel

dont
tell
me
that
you
im
sorry

i
cant
help
it

you
drive
me
crazy
youre
gonna
be
late
for
work

i
dont
care
oh

mrs

eastby

hello

oh

hello
hey

did
you
get
that
pest
control
oh

yes

yes
the
traps
work
better
with
a
little
peanut
butter
its
much
better
than
cheese
despite
the
popular
notion
that
cheese
is
best
oh

this
is
mr

harris

good
afternoon

how
are
you
hello

hello

good
to
meet
you
see
you
later

byebye
but
i
think
that
bruton
street
would
be
perfect
for
the
gallery
because
its
just
right
in
the
thick
of
things
and
itll
just
be
a
natural
success

i
think
because
youre
great
at
picking
out
paintings
and
bricabrac
knowing
my
luck

ill
get
pregnant
the
minute
it
opens
yeah

can
manage
both

i
mean
heths

have
a
problem

have
a
lot
of
